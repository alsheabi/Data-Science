0,"We consider a problem of considerable practical interest: the recovery of a data matrix from a sampling of its entries. Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen?#R##N##R##N#We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys $$m\ge C\,n^{1.2},r\log n$$ for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n×n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information.","['Emmanuel J.

1,"We show how to learn a deep graphical model of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. The values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are easy to infer and give a much better representation of each document than Latent Semantic Analysis. When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of binary variables (e.g. 32), the graphical model performs ''semantic hashing'': Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method. By using semantic hashing to filter the documents given to TF-IDF, we achieve higher accuracy than applying TF-IDF to the entire document set.","['Ruslan Salakhutdinov', 'Geoffrey E.

3,"Semi-supervised clustering algorithms aim to improve clustering results using limited supervision. The supervision is generally given as pairwise constraints; such constraints are natural for graphs, yet most semi-supervised clustering algorithms are designed for data represented as vectors. In this paper, we unify vector-based and graph-based approaches. We first show that a recently-proposed objective function for semi-supervised clustering based on Hidden Markov Random Fields, with squared Euclidean distance and a certain class of constraint penalty functions, can be expressed as a special case of the weighted kernel k-means objective (Dhillon et al., in Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2004a). A recent theoretical connection between weighted kernel k-means and several graph clustering objectives enables us to perform semi-supervised clustering of data given either as vectors or as a graph. For graph data, this result leads to algorithms for optimizing several new semi-supervised graph clustering objectives. For vector data, the kernel approach also enables us to find clusters with non-linear boundaries in the input data space. Furthermore, we show that recent work on spectral learning (Kamvar et al., in Proceedings of the 17th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2003) may be viewed as a special case of our formulation. We empirically show that our algorithm is able to outperform current state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithms on both vector-based and graph-based data sets.","['Brian Kulis', 'Sugato Basu', 'Inderjit S.

7,"We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of online-learning algorithms with convex loss functions. This method has several essential properties: (1) The degree of sparsity is continuous---a parameter controls the rate of sparsification from no sparsification to total sparsification. (2) The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1-regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsification result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. (3) The approach works well empirically. We apply the approach to several data sets and find for data sets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable.","['John Langford', 'Lihong Li', 'Tong Zhang']",ec86ed03-6a38-479e-a4c9-1a4a7274e1ea,326,"['099f4ac2-5f15-42c2-a137-a9751721beb4', '1b30d6fd-2c58-4017-8946-e428234de23f', '1ca459f3-22c0-4de2-8edd-ea779a5b6c04', '2f2a347d-cc88-483a-9723-7767c6046ee0', '3c1f9893-1a32-4afb-9f40-5d4856b7f886', '6fe13464-786c-4668-8c16-5b0461042e78', 'b1ab16c4-7c50-4dfd-90e6-82a9fb00b262', 'b5ed7586-8f67-4e79-ac6b-f8cd6422650a', 'cd17473b-9aec-4099-bf27-b116490b43ea', 'f8b62fcc-2912-427c-a1d8-786f58209193']",Sparse Online Learning via Truncated Gradient,Journal of Machine Learning Research,2009
8,"Dependency-based methods for syntactic parsing have become increasingly popular in natural language processing in recent years. This book gives a thorough introduction to the methods that are most widely used today. After an introduction to dependency grammar and dependency parsing, followed by a formal characterization of the dependency parsing problem, the book surveys the three major classes of parsing models that are in current use: transition-based, graph-based, and grammar-based models. It continues with a chapter on evaluation and one on the comparison of different methods, and it closes with a few words on current trends and future prospects of dependency parsing.

9,"This paper presents a general, fully Bayesian framework for sparse supervised-learning problems based on the horseshoe prior. The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justied theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.","['Carlos M.

10,"This paper presents three feedback controllers that achieve an asymptotically stable, periodic, and fast walking gait for a 3-D bipedal robot consisting of a torso, revolute knees, and passive (unactuated) point feet. The walking surface is assumed to be rigid and flat; the contact between the robot and the walking surface is assumed to inhibit yaw rotation. The studied robot has 8 DOF in the single support phase and six actuators. In addition to the reduced number of actuators, the interest of studying robots with point feet is that the feedback control solution must explicitly account for the robot's natural dynamics in order to achieve balance while walking. We use an extension of the method of virtual constraints and hybrid zero dynamics (HZD), a very successful method for planar bipeds, in order to simultaneously compute a periodic orbit and an autonomous feedback controller that realizes the orbit, for a 3-D (spatial) bipedal walking robot. This method allows the computations for the controller design and the periodic orbit to be carried out on a 2-DOF subsystem of the 8-DOF robot model. The stability of the walking gait under closed-loop control is evaluated with the linearization of the restricted Poincare map of the HZD. Most periodic walking gaits for this robot are unstable when the controlled outputs are selected to be the actuated coordinates. Three strategies are explored to produce stable walking. The first strategy consists of imposing a stability condition during the search of a periodic gait by optimization. The second strategy uses an event-based controller to modify the eigenvalues of the (linearized) Poincare map. In the third approach, the effect of output selection on the zero dynamics is discussed and a pertinent choice of outputs is proposed, leading to stabilization without the use of a supplemental event-based controller.","['Christine Chevallereau', 'Jessy W.

11,"Recent literature on sustainable logistics networks points to two important questions: (i) How to spot the preferred solution(s) balancing environmental and business concerns? (ii) How to improve the understanding of the trade-offs between these two dimensions? We posit that a visual exploration of the efficient frontier and trade-offs between profitability and environmental impacts are particularly suitable to answer these two questions. The visual representation of the efficient frontier, however, presents two challenges. The first is to obtain a good approximation for such frontier without enumerating all extreme efficient solutions. The second is to obtain a good visual representation of the efficient frontier. We propose a two-phased heuristic to handle these two problems. The algorithm is designed for the multi-objective linear problem with three objectives: minimize costs, cumulative energy demand and waste in a reverse logistics network. We illustrate our approach by designing a complex recycling logistics network in Germany.","['J. Quariguasi Frota Neto', 'Grit Walther', 'J.M.

12,"The degrees of freedom (DoF) of K-user MIMO interference networks with constant channel coefficients are not known in general. Determining the feasibility of a linear interference alignment is a key step toward solving this open problem. Our approach in this paper is to view the alignment problem for interference networks as a multivariate polynomial system and determine its solvability by comparing the number of equations and the number of variables. Consequently, we divide the interference networks into two classes - proper and improper, where interference alignment is and is not achievable, respectively. An interference network is called proper if the cardinality of every subset of equations in the corresponding polynomial system is less than or equal to the number of variables involved in that subset of equations. Otherwise, it is called improper. Our intuition in this paper is that for general channel matrices, proper systems are almost surely feasible and improper systems are almost surely infeasible. We prove the direct link between proper (improper) and feasible (infeasible) systems for some important cases, thus significantly strengthening our intuition. Numerical simulation results also support our intuition.","['Cenk M. Yetis', 'Tiangao Gou', 'Syed Ali Jafar', 'Ahmet H.

14,"This paper provides a closed-form expression for the secrecy capacity of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian wiretap channel, under a power-covariance constraint. Furthermore, the paper specifies the input covariance matrix required in order to attain the capacity. The proof uses the fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory in the Gaussian channel, relating the derivative of the mutual information to the minimum mean-square error (MMSE). The proof provides the missing intuition regarding the existence and construction of an enhanced degraded channel that does not increase the secrecy capacity. The concept of enhancement has been used in a previous proof of the problem. Furthermore, the proof presents methods that can be used in proving other MIMO problems, using this fundamental relationship.","['Ronit Bustin', 'Ruoheng Liu', 'H.

15,"It is envisaged that services and applications will migrate to a cloud-computing paradigm where thin-clients on user devices access, over the network, applications hosted in data centers by application service providers. Examples are cloud based gaming applications and cloud-supported virtual desktops. For good performance and efficiency, it is critical that these services are delivered from locations that are the best for the current (dynamically changing) set of users. To achieve this, we expect that services will be hosted on virtual machines in interconnected data centers and that these virtual machines will migrate dynamically to locations best suited for the current user population. A basic network infrastructure need then is the ability to migrate virtual machines across multiple networks without losing service continuity. In this paper, we develop mechanisms to accomplish this using a network-virtualization architecture that relies on a set of distributed forwarding elements with centralized control (borrowing on several recent proposals in a similar vein). We describe a preliminary prototype system, built using Openflow components, that demonstrates the feasibility of this architecture in enabling seamless migration of virtual machines and in enhancing delivery of cloud-based services.","['Fang Hao', 'T.

19,"Computer experiments often are performed to allow modeling of a response surface of a physical experiment that can be too costly or difficult to run except by using a simulator. Running the experiment over a dense grid can be prohibitively expensive, yet running over a sparse design chosen in advance can result in insufficient information in parts of the space, particularly when the surface calls for a nonstationary model. We propose an approach that automatically explores the space while simultaneously fitting the response surface, using predictive uncertainty to guide subsequent experimental runs. We use the newly developed Bayesian treed Gaussian process as the surrogate model; a fully Bayesian approach allows explicit measures of uncertainty. We develop an adaptive sequential design framework to cope with an asynchronous, random, agent–based supercomputing environment by using a hybrid approach that melds optimal strategies from the statistics literature with flexible strategies from the active learni...","['Robert B.

20,"Click fraud is the practice of deceptively clicking on search ads with the intention of either increasing third-party website revenues or exhausting an advertiser's budget. Search advertisers are forced to trust that search engines detect and prevent click fraud even though the engines get paid for every undetected fraudulent click. We find conditions under which it is in a search engine's interest to allow some click fraud.#R##N##R##N#Under full information in a second-price auction, if x% of clicks are fraudulent, advertisers will lower their bids by x%, leaving the auction outcome and search engine revenues unchanged. However, if we allow for uncertainty in the amount of click fraud or change the auction type to include a click-through component, search engine revenues may rise or fall with click fraud. A decrease occurs when the keyword auction is relatively competitive because advertisers lower their budgets to hedge against downside risk. If the keyword auction is less competitive, click fraud may transfer surplus from the winning advertiser to the search engine. Our results suggest that the search advertising industry would benefit from using a neutral third party to audit search engines' click fraud detection algorithms.","['Kenneth C.

26,"In this paper, we study combinatorial and structural properties of a new class of finite and infinite words that are 'rich' in palindromes in the utmost sense. A characteristic property of the so-called rich words is that all complete returns to any palindromic factor are themselves palindromes. These words encompass the well-known episturmian words, originally introduced by the second author together with Droubay and Pirillo in 2001 [X. Droubay, J. Justin, G. Pirillo, Episturmian words and some constructions of de Luca and Rauzy, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 255 (2001) 539-553]. Other examples of rich words have appeared in many different contexts. Here we present the first unified approach to the study of this intriguing family of words. Amongst our main results, we give an explicit description of the periodic rich infinite words and show that the recurrent balanced rich infinite words coincide with the balanced episturmian words. We also consider two wider classes of infinite words, namely weakly rich words and almost rich words (both strictly contain all rich words, but neither one is contained in the other). In particular, we classify all recurrent balanced weakly rich words. As a consequence, we show that any such word on at least three letters is necessarily episturmian; hence weakly rich words obey Fraenkel's conjecture. Likewise, we prove that a certain class of almost rich words obeys Fraenkel's conjecture by showing that the recurrent balanced ones are episturmian or contain at least two distinct letters with the same frequency. Lastly, we study the action of morphisms on (almost) rich words with particular interest in morphisms that preserve (almost) richness. Such morphisms belong to the class of P-morphisms that was introduced by Hof, Knill, and Simon in 1995 [A. Hof, O. Knill, B. Simon, Singular continuous spectrum for palindromic Schrodinger operators, Comm. Math. Phys. 174 (1995) 149-159].","['A. Glen', 'Jacques Justin', 'Steve Widmer', 'Luca Q.

28,"Wi-Fi clients can obtain much better performance at some commercial hotspots than at others. Unfortunately, there is currently no way for users to determine which hotspot access points (APs) will be sufficient to run their applications before purchasing access. To address this problem, this paper presents  Wifi-Reports , a collaborative service that provides Wi-Fi clients with historical information about AP performance and application support. The key research challenge in Wifi-Reports is to obtain accurate user-submitted reports. This is challenging because two conflicting goals must be addressed in a practical system: preserving the privacy of users' reports and limiting fraudulent reports. We introduce a practical cryptographic protocol that achieves both goals, and we address the important engineering challenges in building Wifi-Reports. Using a measurement study of commercial APs in Seattle, we show that Wifi-Reports would improve performance over previous AP selection approaches in 30%-60% of locations.","['Jeffrey Pang', 'Ben Greenstein', 'Michael Kaminsky', 'Damon McCoy', 'Srinivasan Seshan']",d89e0dfc-9e15-4a18-b435-7dbde4870b41,87,"['0029dab5-4f99-4eee-8a20-9b11d88ae894', '0cd8e313-cd1c-4dc1-9571-fd6289b43de8', '32c4980b-4f22-47ff-b728-e28ee295caab', '41985989-7fdb-4690-8d27-6b5f635fd7dc', '57b12ee7-510c-4252-9099-3fe8cb4798bf', '6f4501b5-f9bf-4f6c-9098-5014bc8cdcbf', '77346ac8-2352-46cc-a36d-ec1a6fa412e4', '7bef7a5f-b3e8-4c59-9d6e-350c13813e7c', '7f940dbf-3cf4-44db-80f7-da9d9930c048', '9f4b09e2-2f7d-4ec3-97ac-b7cefd74cbbf', 'a64594fa-8c15-4d2c-aba2-d42878495f64', 'a6913e56-039d-4ccb-a4f3-b4b84c38cc62', 'aa914349-5c2a-46c1-a777-06716612376c', 'ab81d3bf-6133-4b3f-9a4e-c5e87d5e9850', 'b3a2cdab-c699-4c8e-865f-fd530df35c81', 'b6598598-2758-485c-aaf1-516f91933fe5', 'b8ba1ed9-7fbd-41df-b3e8-87394f11caee', 'c6c87b76-bfe6-4cc5-9e42-54f156f437a0', 'cff1b7c3-dc60-4ac0-a016-0e4b5070310a', 'f045bf8a-f8dd-4c60-973c-05854a2361e2', 'f231a4f2-def5-4491-a06c-b76755d6458f', 'f55154df-99c2-4b26-8fd4-3106e74f9016', 'fa25d2dd-7238-418a-956b-e58b29df7580', 'feddae21-3c05-4743-80fa-b8e101f1b93f']",Wifi-reports: improving wireless network selection with collaboration,"international conference on mobile systems, applications, and services",2009
29,"In this paper we present a novel approach, called Concept Search, which extends syntactic search, i.e., search based on the computation of string similarity between words, with semantic search, i.e., search based on the computation of semantic relations between concepts. The key idea of Concept Search is to operate on complex concepts and to maximally exploit the semantic information available, reducing to syntactic search only when necessary, i.e., when no semantic information is available. The experimental results show that Concept Search performs at least as well as syntactic search, improving the quality of results as a function of the amount of available semantics.","['Fausto Giunchiglia', 'Uladzimir Kharkevich', 'Ilya Zaihrayeu']",133ea406-fe61-4b95-a14c-9fdb2c09e3e1,82,"['1b978417-c775-4777-bad6-ee3ee15f2025', '1ff160fa-95f5-45e3-ae45-75df914472db', '2136d05d-36b3-45fd-9dc2-eb54357dd650', '215e0488-02d7-4f1d-a834-5488cb624064', '2616451f-9c95-4137-8868-459a58df74e5', '4d9863de-7aac-4f76-9c24-bfc5333ba3bd', '5ba7f94c-6f44-4ee6-8cb6-8f11b8482eec', '5ea3f9f9-f0d0-4e56-9ff6-53416426b5bf', '68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be', '6b556b52-df8a-4587-bc75-9d3730b87a70', '8a474872-409e-4467-ae66-7c952f8d1afb', '917e92a9-148a-483e-93c0-ca1edf901ab4', '92f56c04-e870-4860-9696-1d2a7345f20c', 'a657461c-9ef0-43b5-bebe-a1d03fc24013', 'ac14afe6-de4d-4056-b2ac-0f6e36f369a2', 'ae3d3500-1b4c-454c-b922-dcb571c49e1b', 'd28665ed-c1f4-4652-ae5a-efd754e643a7', 'f0bbf333-f4b4-403a-8dff-e743dfe9e0d2']",Concept Search,european semantic web conference,2009
30,"In voting theory,  bribery  is a form of manipulative behavior in which an external actor (the briber) offers to pay the voters to change their votes in order to get her preferred candidate elected. We investigate a model of bribery where the price of each vote depends on the amount of change that the voter is asked to implement. Specifically, in our model the briber can change a voter's preference list by paying for a sequence of swaps of consecutive candidates. Each swap may have a different price; the price of a bribery is the sum of the prices of all swaps that it involves. We prove complexity results for this model, which we call  swap bribery  , for a broad class of voting rules, including variants of approval and  k  -approval, Borda, Copeland, and maximin.","['Edith Elkind', 'Piotr Faliszewski', 'Arkadii Slinko']",6ef03957-54de-468c-83b2-473c9923671e,82,"['0f41c7e6-6eaf-443a-8fca-adacc859c133', '113dac8f-c770-41a3-9929-7114df306150', '231e3855-3d4a-476b-a59b-e1b22fd761f3', '60aec234-60ec-4c96-ba91-563eb4560a51', '79219456-9391-49ff-b964-dc0f4241ffb9', '8189e9ac-8371-4f6a-85ea-f8044633cdf0', '9a0aad07-b223-4ab1-8686-9bb9fcd91a41', '9dc3e527-4602-4fa1-86fa-697a92da0c91', 'bc0cb68b-bd2c-4de0-98c7-0ac71a70f980', 'c6101b29-1a87-4b19-a839-14e08aa41494', 'd0dcccf4-b047-4660-ac6d-2e041e4dbc53']",Swap Bribery,algorithmic game theory,2009

32,"The convergence and optimality of adaptive mixed finite element methods for the Poisson equation are established in this paper. The main difficulty for mixed finite element methods is the lack of minimization principle and thus the failure of orthogonality. A quasi-orthogonality property is proved using the fact that the error is orthogonal to the divergence free subspace, while the part of the error that is not divergence free can be bounded by the data oscillation using a discrete stability result. This discrete stability result is also used to get a localized discrete upper bound which is crucial for the proof of the optimality of the adaptive approximation.","['Long Chen', 'Michael Holst', 'Jinchao Xu']",650bdbd1-48d6-45ca-8f50-ce487ff87385,77,"['00eea270-e7c7-4076-a5c6-15ece7f82649', '0e0f4a4c-1970-49a4-8ec4-a98360873903', '130e941a-c08d-462b-a7c8-1d03eebe6856', '28cc7b8b-8f5a-4e12-9cb7-2381a7644f04', '2b5f9bcd-8588-4b33-b77b-ab284e49ca6d', '3952c96a-ee08-4e20-b1a8-ccbb6f79496c', '3dff566f-19df-4b69-951b-e66019413baa', '3e833d25-b0f3-4e74-b31b-07950c073a4f', '508a72a3-f80d-49eb-b139-ccc15487f46c', '827e0ae6-3398-4ffb-ae42-1a18a574253c', '880e58f8-7028-4061-9be0-64b76c5808cf', '8e5152b9-b9e0-41a9-b2af-d5196c585516', '9de44f68-1878-499b-9811-cf99537db427', 'ba00d35e-6c9d-413a-a86a-19d161dd5bb5', 'c4b55edf-060a-4c90-aea6-739816aa290d', 'ca271f54-85e5-44db-b831-7b231f9f0fe6', 'd3dcf061-6f25-4914-95af-876f3cd449f4', 'd9d71975-7538-41c0-8892-77fbe30961ec', 'dea08b11-a82d-47aa-8287-2a7be91e9d94', 'e31ff5f6-c904-4a31-80da-257eab72a009', 'e5eb1ca1-eebb-46dc-ab05-0af1ab09a067', 'e68aa321-e2db-4976-9be8-bdbdd3a9ed41', 'eafb8fc7-edcc-45bc-a9dd-c4ddc592f745', 'fe9df763-e625-428d-b4ff-83a85d94d6a0', 'fef1a21f-ffd5-40d6-9f43-64c005d48211']",Convergence and Optimality of Adaptive Mixed Finite Element Methods,Mathematics of Computation,2009

We bound the time to reach steady state by a tower-of-twos of height linear in the number of birds. We prove that, surprisingly, the tower-of-twos growth is intrinsic to the model.

Given an interval g, we write X →g Y to denote that the difference between the Y -attribute values of any two consecutive records, when sorted on X, must be in g. For example, time →(0,∞) sequence_number indicates that sequence numbers are strictly increasing over time, whereas sequence_number →[4, 5] time means that the time ""gaps"" between consecutive sequence numbers are between 4 and 5. Sequential dependencies express relationships between ordered attributes, and identify missing (gaps too large), extraneous (gaps too small) and out-of-order data.#R##N##R##N#To make sequential dependencies applicable to real-world data, we relax their requirements and allow them to hold approximately (with some exceptions) and conditionally (on various subsets of the data).

As a solution, this paper examines the relationships between Web site credibility, target audiences’ active trust and behaviour. Using structural equation modelling to evaluate two credibility models, this study concludes that Web site credibility is best considered a three-dimensional construct composed of expertise, trustworthiness and visual appeal, and that trust plays a partial mediating role between Web site credibility and behavioural impacts. The paper examines theoretical implications of conceptualizing Web sites according to a human credibility model, and factoring trust into Internet-based behavioural change interventions. Practical guidelines suggest ways to address these findings when planning online social marketing interventions.","['Brian Cugelman', 'Mike Thelwall', 'Philip L.

42,"This book gives a detailed overview of SIP specific security issues and how to solve them While the standards and products for VoIP and SIP services have reached market maturity, security and regulatory aspects of such services are still being discussed. SIP itself specifies only a basic set of security mechanisms that cover a subset of possible security issues. In this book, the authors survey important aspects of securing SIP-based services. This encompasses a description of the problems themselves and the standards-based solutions for such problems. Where a standards-based solution has not been defined, the alternatives are discussed and the benefits and constraints of the different solutions are highlighted. Key Features: Will help the readers to understand the actual problems of using and developing VoIP services, and to distinguish between real problems and the general hype of VoIP security Discusses key aspects of SIP security including authentication, integrity, confidentiality, non-repudiation and signalling Assesses the real security issues facing users of SIP, and details the latest theoretical and practical solutions to SIP Security issues Covers secure SIP access, inter-provider secure communication, media security, security of the IMS infrastructures as well as VoIP services vulnerabilities and countermeasures against Denial-of-Service attacks and VoIP spam This book will be of interest to IT staff involved in deploying and developing VoIP, service users of SIP, network engineers, designers and managers. Advanced undergraduate and graduate students studying data/voice/multimedia communications as well as researchers in academia and industry will also find this book valuable.","['Dorgham Sisalem', 'John Floroiu', 'Jiri Kuthan', 'Ulrich Abend', 'Henning Schulzrinne']",7155ee65-9b5f-4db4-b93d-5d80b0f4cc5a,54,[],SIP Security,,2009

44,Convex interval games are introduced and characterizations are given. Some economic situations leading to convex interval games are discussed. The Weber set and the Shapley value are defined for a suitable class of interval games and their relations with the interval core for convex interval games are established. The notion of population monotonic interval allocation scheme (pmias) in the interval setting is introduced and it is proved that each element of the Weber set of a convex interval game is extendable to such a pmias. A square operator is introduced which allows us to obtain interval solutions starting from the corresponding classical cooperative game theory solutions. It turns out that on the class of convex interval games the square Weber set coincides with the interval core.,"['S. Z. Alparslan Gök', 'Rodica Branzei', 'S.H.

49,"Recently there has been much interest in design of systems to manage signal and noise environments adaptively with resource strategies that are optimized for detection performance. These approaches are particularly important for scenarios where the noise environment can change and therefore affect the amount of resources necessary for detection and estimation. A common way to manage these tradeoffs uses a min-max estimation strategy to handle the worst case signal and noise distribution and set resources and detection thresholds accordingly. In many of these approaches however, the difficulty of setting the number of resources to achieve the min-max bound for the worst case probability are difficult to gauge. We propose an approach that considers resource allocation as a problem in sparse approximation. The idea is to measure the current probability distribution and adapt to stay within the worst case bound while using the minimum number of resources necessary.",['Robert J.

Starting with a random graph Ggenerated by some rule, form an auxiliary graph G′ whose vertices are the k-cliques of G, in which two vertices are joined if the corresponding cliques share k – 1 vertices. They considered in particular the case where G = G(n,p), and found heuristically the threshold function p = p(n) above which a giant component appears in G′. Here we give a rigorous proof of this result, as well as many extensions.

We propose a real space split operator method for the solution of the time-dependent Klein-Gordon equation with arbitrary electromagnetic fields. Split operator methods for the Schrodinger equation and the Dirac equation typically operate alternately in real space and momentum space and, therefore, require the computation of a Fourier transform in each time step. However, the fact that the kinetic energy operator K@^ in the two-component representation of the Klein-Gordon equation is a nilpotent operator, that is K@^^2=0, allows us to implement the split operator method for the Klein-Gordon equation entirely in real space. Consequently, the split operator method for the Klein-Gordon equation does not require the computation of a Fourier transform and may be parallelized efficiently by domain decomposition.","['Matthias Ruf', 'Heiko Bauke', 'Christoph H.

65,"Trust, which has been found to be a significant facilitator for the adoption and usage of new business paradigms like e-commerce, is relatively unexplored in the context of e-government. Using trust literature as the theoretical lens, we propose an e-government trust grid for the adoption and usage of e-government, comprising two dimensions: ‘trust in government' and ‘trust in Internet technology.' Based on their levels of trust in the two identified dimensions, nations can fall into one of four quadrants: Adversarial, Competitive, Cooperative, and Collaborative. Using focus groups and interviews with young adults in Singapore, we find that in recent years, Singapore is evolving from the cooperative (low trust in Internet technology and high trust in government) to the collaborative (high trust in Internet technology and high trust in government) quadrant. The study delineates a set of lessons learned from the Singapore experience for engendering citizen trust in e-government. These lessons for governments are: solicit feedback from citizens, demonstrate top leadership commitment and support, build institutional trust, cultivate IT literacy, and enact comprehensive and effective legal systems.","['Shirish C.

67,In this paper we explore an extension of the Type Indeterminacy model of decision-making to strategic decision-making. A 2×2 game is investigated. We first show that in a one-shot simultaneous move setting the TI-model is equivalent to the standard Bayes-Harsanyi model. We then let the game be preceded by a cheap-talk promise game. We show in an example that in the TI-model the promise stage can have an impact on the next following behavior when the standard Bayes-Harsanyi model predicts no impact whatsoever. The TI approach differs from other behavioral approaches in identifying the source of the effect of cheap-talk promises in the intrinsic indeterminacy of the players' type.,"['Jerome R.

68,"We model a network in which messages spread by a simple directed graph G=(V,E) and a function @a:V->N mapping each v@?V to a positive integer less than or equal to the indegree of v. The graph G represents the individuals in the network and the communication channels between them. An individual v@?V will be convinced of a message when at least @a(v) of its in-neighbors are convinced. Suppose we are to convince a message to the individuals by first convincing a subset of individuals, called the seeds, and then let the message spread. We study the minimum number min-seed (G,@a) of seeds needed to convince all individuals at the end. In particular, we prove a lower bound on min-seed (G,@a) and the NP-completeness of computing min-seed (G,@a). We also analyze the special case, called the strict-majority scenario, where each individual is convinced of a message when more than half of its in-neighbors are convinced. For the strict-majority scenario, we prove three results. First, we show that with high probability over the Erdos-Renyi random graphs G(n,p), @W(min{n,1/p},) seeds are needed to convince all individuals at the end. Second, if G=(V,E) is undirected, then a set of s uniformly random samples from V convinces no more than an expected s(2|E|+2|V|)|V| individuals at the end. Third, in a digraph G=(V,E) with a positive minimum indegree, one can find in polynomial (in |V|) time a set of at most (23/27)|V| seeds convincing all individuals.","['Ching-Lueh Chang', 'Yuh-Dauh Lyuu']",0783133a-e6e3-4a82-a7ef-3f21b38de40d,50,"['34215ebc-62e1-449b-9261-6b646f33b0c6', '437fe32f-c853-4de2-a832-d975463b7f68', 'bf48851e-7a5b-450f-8d46-2c298093489f', 'c8553ee9-5a61-4211-939e-6df857da25c3', 'e53362a1-93b8-409e-b85f-5032d0595432', 'f9fff586-d228-4bad-b753-47189e2ab6b5']",Spreading messages,,2009

The aim of this work is to present the need of reliability analysis in fault-tolerant control design. The admissibility of system reconfigurability with respect to the reliability constraints is considered in this research. This analysis proves that the control reconfigurability is a system property that not only related to the Gramian controllability but also to the overall system reliability. An admissible solution for reconfigurability indicator generation is proposed according to the reliability evaluation in degraded mode.

77,"Predictive text entry provides a fast way to enter text on phones and other small devices. Early work on predictive text entry highlighted that the reaction time for checking the screen dominates text entry times. Improving accuracy of predictions brings a downside: as prediction gets better, users will drop the slow operation of checking the screen and will thus miss prediction errors and system feedback/suggestions. In this note, we present an experiment into the use of vibration to alert the user when word completion is likely to aid them, using a dynamic approach based on their current typing speed, and when there are no dictionary matches to their entry. Results show significantly faster entry rates for users with vibration alerts, raising speeds from 20wpm to 23wpm once practiced.","['Mark D.

Our approach is purely dynamic, and it detects problems with implicit paths via a dynamic check that avoids the need for an approximate static analyses while still guaranteeing non-interference. We incorporate this check into an efficient evaluation strategy based on sparse information labeling that leaves information flow labels implicit whenever possible, and introduces explicit labels only for values that migrate between security domains.

An optimum algorithm for the power and time allocation for an intra-cluster and inter-cluster slot has been proposed. By introducing two adjusting parameters for the energy and the time slot respectively, this algorithm is designed to achieve the maximum data throughput for one single-hop and at the same time remain within the tolerance of the outage probability requirement. Performance of different STBC schemes using such an optimum algorithm and the SISO transmission method are compared by simulation.","['Xiaojun Wen', 'David Laurenson']",4e4eb8f8-f6ef-47f0-bb76-2cf3a2ae6211,50,"['0b56b79e-ad8c-469a-80c9-8461dc0c05fc', '25a24c2c-d4e4-468a-844e-f777899f168b', '2a408fa3-ad75-4e1f-b9b7-82f95cab585c', '30e65d33-85c3-41af-a572-c2a54de60710', '49a5bfcd-05e3-4a2e-afba-cc1537aac030', '5fec7385-fd12-43d7-af67-a0ce07fb8c33', '748a2ab3-8b5f-4d0a-9e2d-af685089843a', '7ae0e791-2e2b-4504-a2fe-caa9b0589c44', '8ab7a708-a65d-468c-b254-ab82a597b7d1', 'a729c14b-e98b-4e5c-a0aa-1fbf909cc134', 'df022bb5-acf5-4e1b-b5d2-a8a7454867e8', 'ec6e64ad-4d81-47fc-b067-f85c51861cb7', 'efdb41f4-8edc-48b0-870e-ea9343a7c08d']",A resource allocation algorithm for cluster-based cooperative MIMO in Wireless Sensor Networks,international conference on ultra modern telecommunications,2009

83,We develop a simple model featuring search frictions and a nondegenerate labor supply decision along the extensive margin. The model is a standard version of the neoclassical growth model with indivisible labor with idiosyncratic shocks and frictions characterized by employment loss and employment opportunity arrival shocks. We argue that it is able to account for the key features of observed labor market flows for reasonable parameter values. Persistent idiosyncratic productivity shocks play a key role in allowing the model to match the persistence of the employment and out of the labor force states found in individual labor market histories.,"['Per Krusell', 'Toshihiko Mukoyama', 'Richard Rogerson', 'Aysegul Sahin']",2be0fe43-2e67-4bac-9b7c-d7985b71901e,50,[],A Three State Model of Worker Flows in General Equilibrium,,2009

85,"The outcomes of many strategic situations such as parlor games or competitive economic scenarios are rankings of the participants, with higher ranks generally at least as desirable as lower ranks. Here we define ranking games as a class of n-player normal-form games with a payoff structure reflecting the players' von Neumann-Morgenstern preferences over their individual ranks. We investigate the computational complexity of a variety of common game-theoretic solution concepts in ranking games and deliver hardness results for iterated weak dominance and mixed Nash equilibrium when there are more than two players, and for pure Nash equilibrium when the number of players is unbounded but the game is described succinctly. This dashes hope that multi-player ranking games can be solved efficiently, despite their profound structural restrictions. Based on these findings, we provide matching upper and lower bounds for three comparative ratios, each of which relates two different solution concepts: the price of cautiousness, the mediation value, and the enforcement value.","['Felix Brandt', 'Felix A.

86,"In negation-limited complexity, one considers circuits with a limited number of NOT gates, being motivated by the gap in our understanding of monotone versus general circuit complexity, and hoping to better understand the power of NOT gates. We give improved lower bounds for the size (the number of AND/OR/NOT) of negation-limited circuits computing Parity and for the size of negation-limited inverters. An inverter is a circuit with inputs x 1,…,x n and outputs ¬ x 1,…,¬ x n . We show that: (a) for n=2 r −1, circuits computing Parity with r−1 NOT gates have size at least 6n−log 2(n+1)−O(1), and (b) for n=2 r −1, inverters with r NOT gates have size at least 8n−log 2(n+1)−O(1). We derive our bounds above by considering the minimum size of a circuit with at most r NOT gates that computes Parity for sorted inputs x 1≥⋅⋅⋅≥x n . For an arbitrary r, we completely determine the minimum size. It is 2n−r−2 for odd n and 2n−r−1 for even n for ⌈log 2(n+1)⌉−1≤r≤n/2, and it is ⌊3n/2⌋−1 for r≥n/2. We also determine the minimum size of an inverter for sorted inputs with at most r NOT gates. It is 4n−3r for ⌈log 2(n+1)⌉≤r≤n. In particular, the negation-limited inverter for sorted inputs due to Fischer, which is a core component in all the known constructions of negation-limited inverters, is shown to have the minimum possible size. Our fairly simple lower bound proofs use gate elimination arguments in a somewhat novel way.","['Kazuo Iwama', 'Hiroki Morizumi', 'Jun Tarui']",1e867e5a-1315-4304-b893-6d05cd7e4bd1,50,"['36717ec4-8124-4676-9510-c3706eb6719a', '4b1722c2-0bff-4224-8e37-0fa6455ae487', '59424e49-9e85-48c7-a376-81c30e32417e', '6b426df0-b9b1-48c4-b609-df7e94d07c63', '719238cd-c216-491e-a79a-666e96e06867', '761b5f71-d341-4e29-8843-b2cd2c00de0b', 'dde9cd7b-e80c-4033-a6d9-ca3a30d7cefc', 'ede33afd-7050-46a9-a62f-fb632bf6edf3']",Negation-Limited Complexity of Parity and Inverters,Algorithmica,2009

89,"We initiate the study of sublinear-time algorithms in the external memory model [1]. In this model, the data is stored in blocks of a certain size  B  , and the algorithm is charged a unit cost for each block access. This model is well-studied, since it reflects the computational issues occurring when the (massive) input is stored on a disk. Since each block access operates on  B  data elements in parallel, many problems have external memory algorithms whose number of block accesses is only a small fraction (e.g. 1/ B  ) of their main memory complexity.#R##N##R##N#However, to the best of our knowledge, no such reduction in complexity is known for  any  sublinear-time algorithm. One plausible explanation is that the vast majority of sublinear-time algorithms use random sampling and thus exhibit no locality of reference. This state of affairs is quite unfortunate, since both sublinear-time algorithms and the external memory model are important approaches to dealing with massive data sets, and ideally they should be combined to achieve best performance.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we show that such combination is indeed possible. In particular, we consider three well-studied problems: testing of  distinctness  ,  uniformity  and  identity  of an empirical distribution induced by data. For these problems we show random-sampling-based algorithms whose number of block accesses is up to a factor of $1/\sqrt{B},$ smaller than the main memory complexity of those problems. We also show that this improvement is optimal for those problems.#R##N##R##N#Since these problems are natural primitives for a number of sampling-based algorithms for other problems, our tools improve the external memory complexity of other problems as well.","['Alexandr Andoni', 'Piotr Indyk', 'Krzysztof Onak', 'Ronitt Rubinfeld']",04644bca-3761-48ed-b603-499e56cf2f35,50,"['22711819-f42b-4219-8ef5-58ad25be3b0b', '2a9566e7-81d7-49cc-991c-69d410af376d', '30ba55f3-b900-4ec5-8dcd-4b38648f66e2', '46e8b0dc-45d9-4183-b61c-92166054877f', '80c00a5e-6f3e-4724-9ae1-b697f78ccf68', 'df283404-3405-4729-83c7-b767f4fd68e1', 'fb966012-dd65-4219-9650-d875a95a4627']",External Sampling,"international colloquium on automata, languages and programming",2009

Qiu, Cao and Ying, Liu and Qiu interestingly developed the theory of FDESs. As a continuation of Qiu's work, this paper is to deal with the Lyapunov stability of FDESs, some main results of crisp DESs are generalized. We formalize the notions of the reachability of fuzzy states defined on a metric space. A linear algorithm of computing the  r -reachable fuzzy state set is presented. Then we introduce the definitions of stability and asymptotical stability in the sense of Lyapunov to guarantee the convergence of the behaviors of fuzzy automaton to the desired fuzzy states when system engages in some illegal behaviors which can be tolerated. In particular, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for stability and another for asymptotical stability of FDESs.","['Fuchun Liu', 'Daowen Qiu']",6e906385-c9c3-41c0-9642-e49d31aebb07,50,"['1bc06b70-598b-4543-9ab1-9088b55e1b24', '3b004780-bd65-4a56-8f8a-82cd89c2f24b', '4ce401a9-00a6-48b7-8ff6-f6540850ae1e', '75235a40-fd89-4ffa-a8b6-6b76dab1c7c4', '96dc243c-0efd-4148-b89e-e821bf1c0eb2', 'b194d299-876e-4e77-9f03-83384066f6f2', 'b3a1b787-33dc-4d88-8308-1af34d8cd356', 'f30f74d5-018a-4698-88b6-ccfa9351540b']",Lyapunov Stability of Fuzzy Discrete Event Systems,international conference on intelligent computing,2009
93,"Innovation is the prerequisite of knowledge creation and the essence of knowledge management. It has become a crucial factor in company performance and survival. It can be seen as a process and not only as a result. As a result, innovation is relative to the company's capabilities to learn – way, from which new knowledge can be developed, distributed and used. As a process, it concerns the design of products or new services. It concerns also the emergence, the circulation and the achievement of new ideas. It is located at the core of a progressive collective learning which needs old experiences voluntary capitalization. Finally, we consider it as a complex process which reifies mainly three intertwined sub processes: A social process, an organizational learning process and a knowledge management process.

99,"In this paper we prove that the transitive closure of a non-deterministic octagonal relation using integer counters can be expressed in Presburger arithmetic. The direct consequence of this fact is that the reachability problem is decidable for flat counter automata with octagonal transition relations. This result improves the previous results of Comon and Jurski [7] and Bozga, Iosif and Lakhnech [6] concerning the computation of transitive closures for difference bound relations. The importance of this result is justified by the wide use of octagons to computing sound abstractions of real-life systems [15]. We have implemented the octagonal transitive closure algorithm in a prototype system for the analysis of counter automata, called FLATA, and we have experimented with a number of test cases.","['Marius Bozga', 'Codruţa Gîrlea', 'Radu Iosif']",2144f8fd-dd15-429e-99dc-7c0434aaaa21,50,"['0749d655-539f-4dc7-80ce-604e0f52d314', '47c9336f-9b26-409b-8630-d4d835d9ec79', '4f1c83a4-9e82-4546-a141-15c4dfccfeaf', '6855b4aa-f300-413a-b1f7-cd634ce42c56', '75432120-d662-4ebb-b6c9-32a0e204c11b', '79c92a70-6a00-401a-a62b-18649e48d490', '7bb71afa-91b8-46e7-9008-da84e0427b93', '867d0770-ef58-4dc6-9b70-aaf1e4330fe5', '8d281b86-fec5-4972-b323-d9d5f749cdca', '933797ff-58cd-4d68-afd4-0572a7cad0ec', 'a819db6d-373f-4135-8459-c02cb4cae101', 'cd192c55-ae65-4c98-9345-4b6dc79af008', 'f4270e7e-3819-424b-9ae1-93539fd8901e']",Iterating Octagons,tools and algorithms for construction and analysis of systems,2009

To minimize configuration errors, network administrators typically build a smaller scale test lab replicating the production network and test out their configuration changes before rolling out the changes to production. Unfortunately, building a test lab is expensive and the test equipment is rarely utilized. In this paper, we present Remote Network Labs, which is aimed at leveraging the expensive network equipment more efficiently and reducing the cost of building a test lab. Similar to a server cloud such as Amazon EC2, a user could request network equipment remotely and connect them through a GUI or web services interface. The network equipment is geographically distributed, allowing us to reuse test equipment anywhere. Beyond saving costs, Remote Network Labs brings about many additional benefits, including the ability to fully automate network configuration testing.","['Huan Liu', 'Dan Orban']",283096be-cac4-46ab-8c26-2e3c914e5592,50,"['08188609-efda-4b54-ad07-da2740a6dcd8', '0e015120-cce1-4cb7-bbe3-f0ea3679c5c3', '130bc8d8-4652-4aee-822b-ba6d661d7f4c', '4520fe9f-8ccf-40f3-8c9c-78316b1f8d7b', '5f3ccec5-0e04-4fa3-b4b0-f09f1418e82b', '8f3e6124-b348-4890-9e89-603bbdc30a34', '94738e53-b2eb-4edc-8a74-c696e5b4ee92', '9905dd32-5ca5-491a-8558-1b78e013cad2', '9b6b0abc-a679-43e9-bcb2-14960e320e8e', 'b4c5a9b3-4a9c-4679-abed-30e3ff7f15d6', 'baa0c644-e2a7-4925-9eed-6437cf4b9265', 'c7bf74ee-739c-45c6-9713-6a0eeb08e76d', 'e53c8efb-d371-4e26-910a-a57bdac34982']",Remote network labs: an on-demand network cloud for configuration testing,,2009

The main reason for this state of affairs is that the environment of a data warehouse is in constant change, while the warehouse itself needs to provide a stable and consistent interface to information spanning extended periods of time. In this paper, we propose a modeling technique for data warehousing, called anchor modeling, that offers non-destructive extensibility mechanisms, thereby enabling robust and flexible management of changes in source systems. A key benefit of anchor modeling is that changes in a data warehouse environment only require extensions, not modifications, to the data warehouse. This ensures that existing data warehouse applications will remain unaffected by the evolution of the data warehouse, i.e. existing views and functions will not have to be modified as a result of changes in the warehouse model.","['Olle Regardt', 'Lars Rönnbäck', 'Maria Bergholtz', 'Paul Johannesson', 'Petia Wohed']",35b1c35f-e654-4025-8d10-0b5fa23ee4c5,50,"['3ab627d4-afb7-45a7-9877-b40dfc287c60', '3b97e3eb-7179-4283-92c9-5a6fa61685ff', '5d6edc1c-1fea-4453-89b0-8072cab212a4', '60d5ad86-9b5a-490d-b17d-e7a8d1acbd62', '66cd4724-5ba2-4cc5-9845-82018905402b', '6cddef2b-10b5-4662-a135-0e54f3a57de3', '99e32492-ca51-4384-bbd5-3823da84ad21', '9d90c4e1-726d-4eea-9af1-999ee3e181f4', 'b45cf2f1-f43a-4098-8065-03029c7df373', 'd6285e34-13fa-4327-b4f9-203181baa8c6', 'f52bc858-c6e8-4193-bb39-347349dd0783', 'f6712eb3-d0a1-4fe3-8737-2b0c2166922f', 'fe9b4324-631f-46b2-b230-8d8fe60e7e92']",Anchor Modeling,international conference on conceptual modeling,2009
105,"Search engine queries have evolved over the past 30 years from complex Boolean formulations to short lists of ""keywords."" Despite the apparent simplicity of short queries, choosing the right keywords can be difficult, and understanding user intentions is a major challenge. Techniques such as query expansion and context-based profiles have been developed to address these problems, but with limited success. Rather than trying to infer user intentions from very short queries, another approach is to improve query processing and retrieval models for long queries. In particular, query transformation is a new approach to improving search that appears to have considerable potential. In this approach, queries are transformed into one or more new queries using probabilistic models for generation or search of query archives. I will describe various transformation models and the role of a retrieval model in using these transformations. Examples will be given from applications such as collaborative question answering and forum search.",['W. Bruce Croft'],27d85708-b788-45bd-8b3a-7e3760974fc8,50,[],Query Evolution,,2009
106,"Large sparse circuits of spiking neurons exhibit a balanced state of highly irregular activity under a wide range of conditions. It occurs likewise in sparsely connected random networks that receive excitatory external inputs and recurrent inhibition as well as in networks with mixed recurrent inhibition and excitation. Here we analytically investigate this irregular dynamics in finite networks keeping track of all individual spike times and the identities of individual neurons. For delayed, purely inhibitory interactions we show that the irregular dynamics is not chaotic but stable. Moreover, we demonstrate that after long transients the dynamics converges towards periodic orbits and that every generic periodic orbit of these dynamical systems is stable. We investigate the collective irregular dynamics upon increasing the time scale of synaptic responses and upon iteratively replacing inhibitory by excitatory interactions. Whereas for small and moderate time scales as well as for few excitatory interactions, the dynamics stays stable, there is a smooth transition to chaos if the synaptic response becomes sufficiently slow (even in purely inhibitory networks) or the number of excitatory interactions becomes too large. These results indicate that chaotic and stable dynamics are equally capable of generating the irregular neuronal activity. More generally, chaos apparently is not essential for generating the high irregularity of balanced activity, and we suggest that a mechanism different from chaos and stochasticity significantly contributes to irregular activity in cortical circuits.","['Sven Jahnke', 'Raoul Martin Memmesheimer', 'Marc Timme']",45567efe-13f9-4969-a71d-d46916aee647,50,[],How chaotic is the balanced State,Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience,2009

110,"We maintain that human resources are strategically significant in at least three cases, when these resources (1) help create traditional Ricardian rents; (2) function as components of organizational capabilities that generate nontraditional Ricardian rents; and (3) are the source of technological and managerial innovations that produce entrepreneurial rents. Human resource management (HRM) activities, on the other hand, assume strategic significance by supporting the three cases above through a process that we call managerial entrepreneurship. Furthermore, HRM takes on different forms when supporting each of these types of rents. Hence, this rent-based view has greater potential to help explain the contribution of human resources to firms' competitive advantages than approaches that are grounded in the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, which primarily reflects the Ricardian view of rents. Moreover, a rent-based approach suggests fruitful new ways to address many of the theoretic challenges confronting the strategic human resource management (SHRM) literature.","['Adina Dabu', 'Clint Chadwick']",bcee4547-ca08-48e4-9489-d7104a62341c,50,[],"Human Resources, Human Resource Management, and the Competitive Advantage of Firms: Toward a More Comprehensive Model of Causal Linkages",,2009

The challenge at this higher level regards the representation of all production devices of a shop-oor by suitable control interfaces for a distributed deployment of the control system. The control of industrial robots and their integration into a production system is proposed to be troubled by each robot manufacturer developing their own native application platform. Each native platform oers some pre-chosen paradigm for programming and its own restricted set of technologies available for application development. For migrating the real-time motion control of industrial robots onto application platforms oering higher exibility, or simply the right technologies, than that found in the native controllers, several software frameworks and platforms exist. The work underlying this PhD thesis has produced such a software framework, dubbed PyMoCo. It is entirely implemented in the high-level, interpreted programming language Python, and allows fast and highly exible real-time motion control and application integration of industrial robots. At the shop-floor control level, it is proposed by a segment of the research community dealing with production control, that holonic and multi-agent control architectures are suitable paradigms for bringing highly intelligent, computationally powerful resources into the direct control loops in production systems. The use of autonomous holonic or agent-based systems for distributed real-time shop-oor control presents some inherent difficulties regarding formal validation and verification. Hence, in the research community it has been suggested to use real-time, realistic emulators of the production systems as platforms for experimenting, developing, and validating holonic and agent-based production control systems. This PhD thesis presents principles for using the Blender Game Engine for implementing a physically realistic real-time emulator for the collection of production devices of a production shop-floor. An emulator has been designed and implemented for an extended version of a prototype shop-floor system set up in a laboratory, and an experiment control system has been implemented to validate the emulator. The presented emulator is developed to a state of being suitable for use as a realistic platform for development of a distributed, autonomous multi-agent system for control of the extended prototype shop-floor system.","['Morten Lind', 'Olivier Roulet-Dubonnet', 'Per Åge Nyen', 'Lars Tore Gellein', 'Terje K.

124,"Side effects are both the essence and bane of imperative programming. The programmer must carefully coordinate actions to manage their side effects upon each other. Such coordination is complex, error-prone, and fragile. Coherent reaction is a new model of change-driven computation that coordinates effects automatically. State changes trigger events called reactions that in turn change other states. A coherent execution order is one in which each reaction executes before any others that are affected by its changes. A coherent order is discovered iteratively by detecting incoherencies as they occur and backtracking their effects. Unlike alternative solutions, much of the power of imperative programming is retained, as is the common sense notion of mutable state. Automatically coordinating actions lets the programmer express what to do, not when to do it.   Coherent reactions are embodied in the Coherence language, which is specialized for interactive applications like those common on the desktop and web. The fundamental building block of Coherence is the dynamically typed mutable tree. The fundamental abstraction mechanism is the virtual tree, whose value is lazily computed, and whose behavior is generated by coherent reactions.",['Jonathan Edwards'],ee777379-3d4b-4437-9f97-8e0d425e1d68,50,"['0d261b6a-c94a-4d5e-b44e-eb6ae46581fc', '0d7aad2c-e2ac-44b4-a564-d68f81dea840', '10b864f1-f045-4750-bbdf-175de20c79a6', '202e816b-e265-40a8-8bd3-9a11955081ca', '3c0b0d41-1969-4386-87bf-a9999feb5e2a', '3f460340-fd3f-4158-b42c-beffdea8f173', '47f394f9-1c7a-4a85-a18a-631caa5709e5', '57f90850-dc98-4523-88d3-5e855d2b28ab', '81ad8d98-8e9c-492c-9f0e-dc4b1e6d3d8b', '94d8f424-a1c4-4f00-934c-6cfbc9d466ba', '9b09cb3d-338e-4f7a-b7bb-b1d6f03f1130', '9e3ecf6e-36fe-44c4-ac6a-17c96567bb9d', '9ed5b688-4c47-4b75-9c3d-41cf7b178b34', 'bfce8a65-c13b-4e24-8833-6059a65c3318', 'd24bb077-537c-4dd6-9d77-5ad70a7e7438', 'e0d8897c-db64-47e8-98ff-26e6f98d116d', 'e58b59fa-9c9f-432e-aa10-3a507d00c809', 'f51b3857-1729-4bf2-9a29-3f8e921c1737']",Coherent reaction,"conference on object-oriented programming systems, languages, and applications",2009
125,"This paper describes research investigating the significance of physical experience and materiality in creative digital visual art and design practice. Findings are presented from a recent phenomenological study, which indicates the ways in which memory of lived experience informs creative cognition and feeds the imagination. The importance of physical engagement with the world, through the senses, enables emotional expression to be made in artworks that can be perceived by both artist and audience. Digital creativity support tools have been found, in this research, to lack interfaces that facilitate the translation of these visual aesthetic qualities in the virtual representation. Hand use and the sense of touch stimulate novel ideas and enable practitioners to break from fixated thinking when working with digital design tools. Examples of artworks are presented that illustrate ways in which artists, working with digital technology, make use of physical experience to inform visual ideas and innovate design solutions. Case study research is described that illuminates the ways in which memory of physical bodily experience and the time related factors involved in making by hand are crucial within the creative process.

127,"This paper presents document recognition strategies for two important applications: 1) Recognition of text document containing multiple lines of text data and 2). Comprehensive Check Image Reader This paper describes the challenges in finding and recognizing the fields of interest on the broad document types. A project to study the feasibility of recognizing essays written by middle school students is the focus of this study. In this project, a scanned document is processed to extract individual lines of text from the essay, extract individual words from the line and then apply word recognition techniques to the extracted words. While individual lines of data are extracted accurately using gap information between lines, extraction of words is a much bigger challenge. Since the essays are written by middle school children, word boundaries are ambiguous, especially when words are written in a non-cursive discrete style. In these cases the gaps between words are sometimes smaller than the gaps between characters of the word causing errors in estimating the location of word boundaries. In the second application we treat a bank check as a complete document that has a regular structure and different fields of interest that need to be extracted and recognized. The key challenges are accurate extraction of the different fields followed by accurate recognition of the data in those fields. Many commercial banks have deployed automatic check processing with great success.","['Malayappan Shridhar', 'Gilles F.

Such an analysis of the available Web site metadata not only makes it easier to understand what data is available today; it also serves as the foundation for investigating what kind of information retrieval processes could be driven by that data, and what additional data could be provided by Web sites if they had richer data formats to publish metadata.","['Erik Wilde', 'Anuradha Roy']",bf38aba3-e25c-477a-af92-450880db9f53,50,[],Web Site Metadata,,2009
132,"The HAVEGE algorithm [1] [2] generates unpredictable random numbers by gathering entropy from internal processor states that are inheritably volatile and impossible to tamper with in a controlled fashion by any application running on the target system. The method used to gather the entropy implies that its main loop will almost monopolize the CPU; the output depends on the operating system and other running applications, as well as some internal mechanisms that stir the processor states to generate an enormous amount of entropy. The algorithm was designed with the idea of single-core CPUs in mind, and no parallelization; however the recent market explosion of multi-core CPUs and the lack of results in increasing the CPU frequency justifies the need to research a multithreaded parallel version of HAVEGE, capable of running the same algorithm loop on each core independently and transparently combine the results in one single output bitstream. This paper will demonstrate how such a parallelization is possible and benchmark the output speed of its implementation.","['Alin Suciu', 'Tudor Carean', 'André Seznec', 'Kinga Marton']",b6a928c8-61e0-49b2-b686-ba452a1f6509,50,"['00d09c0d-3f8b-4045-9464-00e171e0e39b', '2a7be259-583f-4386-9726-a59acbf165b2']",Parallel HAVEGE,parallel processing and applied mathematics,2009

Yet developing visualizations is often a tedious activity requiring significant time and expertise. This paper presents a framework for the visualization of constraint-based local search (CBLS) algorithms. Given a high-level model and a declarative visualization specification, the CBLS visualizer systematically produces animations to visualize constraints and objectives, violations, and conflicts, as well as the temporal behavior of these measures. The visualization specification is declarative and typically composed of a triple (what,where,how) indicating what to display, where, and with which graphical objects. The visualizer architecture is compositional and extensible. It provides building blocks which can be assembled freely by the user and focuses almost exclusively on static aspects, the dynamic aspects being automated by the use of invariants.

139,"Constraints have played a central role in cp because they capture key substructures of a problem and efficiently exploit them to boost inference. This paper intends to do the same thing for search, proposing constraint-centered heuristics which guide the exploration of the search space toward areas that are likely to contain a high number of solutions. We first propose new search heuristics based on solution counting information at the level of individual constraints. We then describe efficient algorithms to evaluate the number of solutions of two important families of constraints: occurrence counting constraints, such as alldifferent, and sequencing constraints, such as regular. In both cases we take advantage of existing filtering algorithms to speed up the evaluation. Experimental results on benchmark problems show the effectiveness of our approach.","['Alessandro Zanarini', 'Gilles Pesant']",3a443ee0-4ae1-4c5c-a427-b67bb8e240c7,50,"['087a0c4b-a249-4925-8096-66a51b26b41b', '23f04aaa-c3b2-492c-b6fb-a6cff8df2d52', '27a4628a-d48c-493d-ae09-e62e6d7880b2', '34e59c8f-cce8-4eba-9c5f-b95cba918a71', '45be6859-013c-4dae-854a-171cd1e1107d', '49e158d4-b7f5-49ba-8bdb-2a566f8d53dc', '4b29cbe2-e62e-4f24-9fb6-d13c31e1c489', '54277585-284a-4e84-8feb-9840dedc3d81', '65738961-f852-4bb6-ba9f-b128e660bc40', '6d5f24c0-f515-4532-b3a5-a128920a2608', '8e697e56-0c0f-4258-8dbc-6fc2ac09df1f', 'b065c027-7251-4089-88bb-3932f852c7b0', 'b250617d-8f3c-4961-9e48-fb457856e381', 'b4851255-cd2d-4598-890e-56f248c3f901', 'cacb8b4c-0a0e-4e1f-a690-195135741f1d', 'd31ef15c-028f-4ee0-94e9-9dfde1ef6270', 'dc522008-6b65-4ab0-99e3-a92f0e103933', 'e538675e-05ad-428e-bb0e-17348090f33f', 'f8224265-5a29-4337-90ac-2711e84400d9', 'fdd25828-b0ca-45f0-88ca-955563c466d2']",Solution counting algorithms for constraint-centered search heuristics,Constraints - An International Journal,2009

142,"Finite structures such as point patterns, strings, trees, and graphs occur as ""natural"" representations of structured data in different application areas of machine learning. We develop the theory of structure spaces and derive geometrical and analytical concepts such as the angle between structures and the derivative of functions on structures. In particular, we show that the gradient of a differentiable structural function is a well-defined structure pointing in the direction of steepest ascent. Exploiting the properties of structure spaces, it will turn out that a number of problems in structural pattern recognition such as central clustering or learning in structured output spaces can be formulated as optimization problems with cost functions that are locally Lipschitz. Hence, methods from nonsmooth analysis are applicable to optimize those cost functions.","['Brijnesh J.

145,"In this paper, we propose a hybrid postural control approach taking advantage of data-driven and goal-oriented methods while overcoming their limitations. In particular, we take advantage of the latent space characterizing a given motion database. We introduce a motion constraint operating in the latent space to benefit from its much smaller dimension compared to the joint space. This allows its transparent integration into a Prioritized Inverse Kinematics framework. If its priority is high the constraint may restrict the solution to lie within the motion database space. We are more interested in the alternate case of an intermediate priority level that channels the postural control through a spatiotemporal pattern representative of the motion database while achieving a broader range of goals. We illustrate this concept with a sparse database of large range full-body reach motions.","['Daniel Raunhardt', 'Ronan Boulic']",9f625e21-80df-4972-890e-addc9f13a785,50,"['07daeff2-9bd0-42f6-acf9-a1da27914b47', '0ac31fb9-39d6-432b-884a-ed1b0329ea74', '1ab4909f-924c-44b4-bd2d-e4a00ff83aad', '2b3f31e7-f66c-433d-b7da-3514be2fee9a', '3726c761-2078-41af-a573-73c0928d51c1', '4574eb30-2ec4-4a15-8569-6ae07e159bd3', '479fdcb4-25af-4e10-b67b-280891735280', '63249ecf-be12-4e7b-9ef2-0dd0d972058d', '697b195d-92af-44e2-816b-2fe32dd9d577', '713fd05e-d90b-4500-849b-20fa22736a2e', '73b1e15f-936e-4577-90a5-27c844b176b5', '80b491be-938e-47bb-a0ab-7a7e193a7ac0', '8cd86726-4368-4a64-a3da-096ebd3fd65b', '9046f41e-7190-4832-b0a8-94cce9438aaa', '9150bd6d-8b2e-47a0-9a30-58e47011b663', '967787cf-b2af-442b-b04c-6553b50ad9e1', 'aab2602c-0a8f-4906-9eb2-a6eeff0174e1', 'af30bb1e-ce40-496c-8d3a-c2a299bd388e', 'c99249ef-290a-4dd4-b845-0fad3f716c4a', 'd996da44-1785-40ca-b6fb-6f1fd42da23a', 'eac44870-7d5c-4021-96ca-7533ca115a88', 'f6846464-25f0-4f86-8b86-e4f3cde1c271']",Motion constraint,,2009

148,"Abstract. This paper focuses on Active Learning with a limited num- ber of queries; in application domains such as Numerical Engineering, the size of the training set might be limited to a few dozen or hundred exam- ples due to computational constraints. Active Learning under bounded resources is formalized as a ﬁnite horizon Reinforcement Learning prob- lem, where the sampling strategy aims at minimizing the expectation of the generalization error. A tractable approximation of the optimal (in- tractable) policy is presented, the Bandit-based Active Learner (BAAL) algorithm. Viewing Active Learning as a single-player game, BAAL com- bines UCT, the tree structured multi-armed bandit algorithm proposed by Kocsis and Szepesv´ri (2006), and billiard algorithms. A proof of a principle of the approach demonstrates its good empirical convergence toward an optimal policy and its ability to incorporate prior AL crite- ria. Its hybridization with the Query-by-Committee approach is found to improve on both stand-alone BAAL and stand-alone QbC.","['Philippe Rolet', 'Michèle Sebag', 'Olivier Teytaud']",800d439e-3c19-4436-9108-40189fb87238,50,[],"Boosting Active Learning to Optimality: a Tractable Monte-Carlo, Billiard-based Algorithm",,2009

We consider the problem of constructing sparse (1+e)-spanners with small hop diameter for metrics of low doubling dimension.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we show that given any metric with constant doubling dimension k and any 0<e<1, one can find (1+e)-spanner for the metric with nearly linear number of edges (i.e., only O(nlog * n+n e −O(k)) edges) and constant hop diameter; we can also obtain a (1+e)-spanner with linear number of edges (i.e., only n e −O(k) edges) that achieves a hop diameter that grows like the functional inverse of Ackermann’s function. Moreover, we prove that such tradeoffs between the number of edges and the hop diameter are asymptotically optimal.","['T.-H.

166,"In modern sequential VLSI designs, clock tree plays an important role in synchronizing different components in a chip. To reduce peak current and power/ground noises caused by clock network, assigning different signal polarities to clock buffers is proposed in previous work. Although peak current and power/ground noises are minimized by signal polarities assignment, an assignment without timing information may increase the clock skew significantly. As a result, a timing-aware signal polarities assigning technique is necessary. In this article, we propose a novel signal polarities assigning technique which can not only reduce peak current and power/ground noises simultaneously but also render the clock skew in control. The experimental result shows that the clock skew produced by our algorithm is 94p of original clock skew in average while the clock skews produced by three algorithms (Partition, MST, Matching) in the absence of post clock tuning steps in the previous work are 235p, 272p, and 283p, respectively. Moreover, our algorithm is as efficient as the three algorithms of the previous work in reducing peak current and power/ground noises.","['Po-Yuan Chen', 'Kuan-Hsien Ho', 'TingTing Hwang']",e0835509-b67a-44f9-bc00-3361ef671fda,50,"['152911ea-b45a-4acd-8f3f-7b3f8ea57790', '4cb2775b-ea54-4e2b-a2f7-106d945d7908', 'b0f200f5-1393-4e60-aa25-b1ac343ad88a', 'b44c61e9-1c3f-49b3-bfed-aeff8a05ea8f', 'cc75ec75-5a33-4be9-8207-d267f914c7cf', 'e1580a8e-7ac3-4d30-bec5-fde0867e0991', 'e9398885-1df2-41f5-9f93-b5518b1ebc0a']",Skew-aware polarity assignment in clock tree,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,2009

Together with a new lower bound it follows that the overall competitive ratio of this optimal algorithm is between 2.054 and e≈2.718.

In this paper, we utilize several signal processing and machine learning techniques such as hierarchical clustering and support vector machines (SVM) to process multisensor acoustic emission (AE) data generated by the inception and propagation of cracks. We present preliminary laboratory results that explore the pairwise event correlation of AE waveforms generated in the process of controlled crack propagation, and use these characteristics for clustering AE. By averaging the AE events within each cluster obtained from hierarchical clustering, we compute super-acoustics with higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) and use them in the second step of our analysis for calculating the time of arrival information (TOA) for crack localization. We utilize a SVM classifier to recognize the so called P-waves in the presence of noise by using features extracted from the frequency domain for accurate earliest arrival detection. Preliminary results show that our method has the potential to be a component of a structural health monitoring system based on acoustic emissions for instance for bridges.","['Nuri F.

In this paper we consider the exact computation of score distributions for similarity searches in ontologies, and introduce a simple null hypothesis which can be used to compute a P-value for the statistical significance of similarity scores. We concentrate on measures based on Resnik's definition of ontological similarity. A new algorithm is proposed that collapses subgraphs of the ontology graph and thereby allows fast score distribution computation. The new algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than the naive approach, as we demonstrate by computing score distributions for similarity searches in the Human Phenotype Ontology.","['M.

172,"This paper proposes practical coordinated linear transmit-receive processing schemes for the uplink (UL) of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in the time division duplex (TDD) mode. The base station (BS) computes the transmission parameters in a centralized manner and employs downlink (DL) pilot signals to convey the information of the beam selection and beamformers to be used by the terminals. When coexisting with the DL transmit-receive zero forcing, the precoded DL demodulation pilots can be reused for UL beam allocation so that no additional pilot overhead is required. Furthermore, the locally available channel state information (CSI) of the effective MIMO channel is sufficient for the terminals to perform transmit power and rate allocation independently. In order to reduce the UL pilot overhead as well, we propose reusing the precoded UL demodulation pilots in turn for partial CSI sounding. The achievable sum rate of the system is evaluated in time-varying fading channels and with channel estimation. According to the results, the proposed UL transmission strategy provides increased rates compared to single-user MIMO transmission combined with user selection as well as to UL antenna selection transmission, without being sensitive to CSI uncertainty.","['Petri Komulainen', 'Antti Tölli', 'Matti Latva-aho', 'Markku J.

181,"In broadband wireless Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems where a set of subcarriers are shared among multiple users, the overall system throughput can be improved by a band-AMC mode that assigns each suband, a set of contiguous subcarriers within a coherence bandwidth, to individual user with the better channel quality. As long as channel qualities for the subbands of all users are known a priori, multiuser and multiband gains can be simultaneously achieved with opportunistic scheduling. This paper presents an analytical means of evaluating the maximum system throughput for a band-adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) mode under the various system parameters. In particular, the practical features of resource management for OFDMA system are carefully modeled within the current analytical framework. Our numerical results demonstrate that band-AMC mode outperforms the diversity mode only by providing the channel qualities for a subset of good subbands, confirming the multiuser and multiband diversity gain that can be achieved by the band-AMC mode.","['Sung Kyung Kim', 'Chung Gu Kang']",d01aa823-bb13-4e49-a8e7-dd59ec91a697,50,"['019f1bb7-31f0-427f-a50e-622a780e5a5d', '27ffe39d-1309-4dec-8013-2a51d868a9b6', '790fe565-31c0-48db-91f1-92d609b1b053', 'f3cbfe33-1331-4bae-8ca4-8a67adb18adc']",Throughput analysis of band-AMC scheme in broadband wireless OFDMA system,Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,2009

185,"Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are revolutionizing oceanography through their versatility, autonomy and endurance. However, they are still an underutilized technology. For coastal operations, the ability to track a certain feature is of interest to ocean scientists. Adaptive and predictive path planning requires frequent communication with significant data transfer. Currently, most AUVs rely on satellite phones as their primary communication. This communication protocol is expensive and slow. To reduce communication costs and provide adequate data transfer rates, we present a hardware modification along with a software system that provides an alternative robust disruption- tolerant communications framework enabling cost-effective glider operation in coastal regions. The framework is specifically designed to address multi-sensor deployments. We provide a system overview and present testing and coverage data for the network. Additionally, we include an application of ocean-model driven trajectory design, which can benefit from the use of this network and communication system. Simulation and implementation results are presented for single and multiple vehicle deployments. The presented combination of infrastructure, software development and deployment experience brings us closer to the goal of providing a reliable and cost-effective data transfer framework to enable real-time, optimal trajectory design, based on ocean model predictions, to gather in situ measurements of interesting and evolving ocean features and phenomena.","['Ryan N.

189,"This paper addresses the problem of testing whether a Boolean-valued function f is a halfspace, i.e. a function of the form f(x) = sgn(w · x - θ). We consider halfspaces over the continuous domain Rn (endowed with the standard multivariate Gaussian distribution) as well as halfspaces over the Boolean cube {−1, 1},n (endowed with the uniform distribution). In both cases we give an algorithm that distinguishes halfspaces from functions that are e-far from any halfspace using only poly(1/e) queries, independent of the dimension n.#R##N##R##N#Two simple structural results about halfspaces are at the heart of our approach for the Gaussian distribution: the first gives an exact relationship between the expected value of a halfspace f and the sum of the squares of f's degree-1 Hermite coefficients, and the second shows that any function that approximately satisfies this relationship is close to a halfspace. We prove analogous results for the Boolean cube {−1, 1},n (with Fourier coefficients in place of Hermite coefficients) for balanced halfspaces in which all degree-1 Fourier coefficients are small. Dealing with general halfspaces over {−1, 1},n poses significant additional complications and requires other ingredients. These include ""cross-consistency"" versions of the results mentioned above for pairs of halfspaces with the same weights but different thresholds; new structural results relating the largest degree-1 Fourier coefficient and the largest weight in unbalanced halfspaces; and algorithmic techniques from recent work on testing juntas [FKR+02].","['Kevin Matulef', ""Ryan O'Donnell"", 'Ronitt Rubinfeld', 'Rocco A.

195,"Analysts examining complex simulation models often conduct screening experiments to identify important factors. The controlled sequential bifurcation screening procedures CSB and CSB-X use a sequence of tests to classify factors as important or unimportant, while controlling Type I error and power. These procedures require analysts to identify the directions of the effects prior to experimentation, which can be problematic. We propose hybrid two-phase approaches, FFCSB and FFCSBX, as alternatives. Phase 1 uses an efficient fractional factorial to estimate factor effect directions; phase 2 uses CSB or CSB-X. Empirical investigations show these outperform CSB(X) in efficiency and effectiveness for many situations of practical interest.","['Susan M. Sanchez', 'Hong Wan', 'Thomas W.

Furthermore, reducing the matrix size by splitting the dispersive channel impulse response into clusters means that the degenerated inverse matrix estimator (DIME) is feasible for broadband, high-quality OFDM transmission systems. In addition to theoretical analysis on normalized mean squared error (NMSE) performance of DIME, computer simulations over realistic nonsample spaced channels also showed that the DIME is robust for intersymbol interference (ISI) channels and fast time-invariant channels where a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator does not work well.",['Makoto Yoshida'],bb2970fb-193d-41eb-95c2-d926fa121a3b,50,"['54f7a947-ae34-44c8-bea7-0e63ee6e3386', '92119a80-d8f3-486d-a4a7-ac886f8c75ea', '9b1eed26-493c-498c-b19e-681a894a3c6f', 'a2cabf7b-54dd-4741-99c9-741a9ea45871', 'b6025038-08d0-43dd-8a37-3dadc1da2bc6', 'eeee2f2b-ce87-40ed-b0c1-e39c0be50c1c']",Degenerated-inverse-matrix-based channel estimation for OFDM systems,Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,2009

215,"In the Gaussian process regression the observation model is commonly assumed to be Gaussian, which is convenient in computational perspective. However, the drawback is that the predictive accuracy of the model can be significantly compromised if the observations are contaminated by outliers. A robust observation model, such as the Student-t distribution, reduces the influence of outlying observations and improves the predictions. The problem, however, is the analytically intractable inference. In this work, we discuss the properties of a Gaussian process regression model with the Student-t likelihood and utilize the Laplace approximation for approximate inference. We compare our approach to a variational approximation and a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, which utilize the commonly used scale mixture representation of the Student-t distribution.","['Jarno Vanhatalo', 'Pasi Jylänki', 'Aki Vehtari']",50b7375c-5275-4238-adaf-a553fd58fac7,50,"['0b7dabfd-e152-4c0f-9db7-8bdd87a6e91b', '2c510057-8fe6-4b24-ab00-5c13273e370b', '4682bab4-4d89-43a7-9493-ad04f38e5e32', '47a93521-1448-4694-9c00-f29ff91f9062', '688a9110-7b34-4628-bc78-8fcc4bdd3010', '8caf036e-3cd6-4d43-bb5a-6bf8edfa1761', 'e06c1a50-0aed-42ae-b71d-7d994ea0efac', 'e0f4178d-6e23-42c5-83c1-6c1805c4d2b2', 'ec8b7f83-5a00-4970-b208-3e828078dd86', 'f059cf76-a330-43f5-a5a2-0e77aeb48ab0', 'f895453e-0aca-490d-988b-38315c03a853', 'fd4e8c45-be77-49de-a6a8-a8ab1acac344']",Gaussian process regression with Student-t likelihood,neural information processing systems,2009

Molecular fingerprints can be used in an initial phase for identifying novel drug candidates by screening large databases for molecules with fingerprints similar to a query fingerprint. In this paper, we present a method which efficiently finds all fingerprints in a database with Tanimoto coefficient to the query fingerprint above a user defined threshold. The method is based on two novel data structures for rapid screening of large databases: the kD grid and the Multibit tree. The kD grid is based on splitting the fingerprints into k shorter bitstrings and utilising these to compute bounds on the similarity of the complete bitstrings. The Multibit tree uses hierarchical clustering and similarity within each cluster to compute similar bounds. We have implemented our method and tested it on a large data set from the industry. Our experiments show that our method yields a three-fold speed-up over previous methods.","['T. Kristensen', 'Jesper Buus Nielsen', 'Christian N. S.

The described method was tested on a number of instances of NS, the largest operator of passenger trains in the Netherlands. These instances involve the generation of rosters for groups of train drivers or conductors of NS. The tests show that high quality solutions for practical instances of the CCRP can be generated in an acceptable amount of computing time. Finally, we describe an experiment where we constructed rosters in an automatic way for a group of conductors.

222,"Intercarrier Interference (ICI) is an impairment well known to degrade performance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions. It arises from carrier frequency offsets (CFOs), from the Doppler spread due to channel time-variation and, to a lesser extent, from sampling frequency offsets (SFOs). Literature reports several models of ICI due to each kind of impairment. Some studies describe ICI due to two of the three impairments, but so far no general model exists to describe the joint effect of all three impairments together. Furthermore, most available models involve some level of approximation, and the diversity of approaches makes it cumbersome to compare power levels of the different kinds of ICI. In this work, we present a general and mathematically exact model for the ICI stemming from the joint effect of the three impairments mentioned. The model allows for a vis-a-vis comparison of signal-to-ICI ratios (SIRs) caused by each impairment. Our result was validated by simulations. An analysis of ICI in IEEE-802.16e-type transmissions shows that during steady-state tracking and at speeds below 150 km/h, SIR due to CFO is typically in the range between 25 dB and 35 dB, SIR due to Doppler spread is larger than 25 dB, and ICI due to SFO is negligible.","['Martín García', 'Christian Oberli']",40bd20a4-91d8-4f6f-a7f4-3a18ff26c6c4,50,"['032c542e-67f4-48fb-a7f6-bda19d643ed6', '20fbecb4-319f-4c70-b4f2-7f9adac2d9d4', '2dfd9714-6835-449c-a287-b36e4ec0a486', '3629fb06-22ff-4d7f-9c86-eb16092a5dc9', '40b2658a-f212-4f64-a949-b4d3a32e1ef5', '68c934d3-fd7b-4013-a316-1ca86d1b5bd3', '69cf0e8f-6e67-4ad7-9788-5a0f181a6d3e', '784d2e2a-232e-445b-9b27-b9106040cde6', '7921c733-6307-454b-afd5-ec169df307a6', '7a00e784-9323-4a2f-aae4-accd2598bfff', '7bef3c8e-f6d5-40cd-9e46-c139380e175b', '843ef4b9-86e4-4faf-9d48-4b57e5af33cb', '942fd1b1-795e-4a81-96ca-8c6bcdc8fee6', 'aff99a88-12a8-4adb-baff-f8189fedde13', 'c7e24980-4cd8-4a97-b67f-d89031ccd745', 'cdea9ab1-cc8d-43fc-b515-d3483fd7786d', 'cfde7a90-9438-4a7e-8c26-0d0d84c90f26', 'de7b79e8-9e86-4e53-bd10-e64600067d27', 'f2a83a54-c6c0-4cbd-8ac9-8ebd4c8da35f', 'f8c9e1d4-0105-4f92-9a57-1a06f0497d4b']",Intercarrier interference in OFDM: a general model for transmissions in mobile environments with imperfect synchronization,Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking,2009
223,"This article presents an efficient technique for placement and routing of sensors/actuators and processing units in a grid network. The driver application that we present is a medical jacket, which requires an extremely high level of robustness and fault tolerance. The power consumption of such jacket is another key technological constraint. Our proposed interconnection network is a mesh of wires. A jacket made of fabric and wires would be susceptible to accidental damage via tears. By modeling the tears, we evaluate the probability of having failures on every segment of wires in our mesh interconnection network. Then, we study two problems of placement and routing in the sensor networks such that the fault tolerance is maximized while the power consumption is minimized. We develop efficient integer linear programming (ILP) formulations to address these problems and perform both placement and routing, simultaneously. This ensures that the solution is a lower bound for both problems. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques on a variety of benchmarks.","['Roozbeh Jafari', 'Hassan Ghasemzadeh', 'Foad Dabiri', 'Ani Nahapetian', 'Majid Sarrafzadeh']",3bf8d808-7993-4fc1-a31b-5e2435f41e61,50,"['0c204d60-ee6d-451f-81da-78105f61fbd4', '1f2d5ee3-8b78-481e-8eba-aeda1f43d9b1', '2174b19d-aa10-450e-9a70-907b6a1d6a87', '299d7e1f-1710-43d2-83da-aa751238de8b', '2f1a6eae-83b0-46d5-8501-3577cad49d57', '33e7c2ab-6561-4fb9-b8de-1505e5a884d7', '3f36cf9a-13ba-4d05-a2a8-120b0f11ce49', '54501e11-a547-41e7-bc2c-b1ed416a3960', '54b24b75-7838-416b-bd01-8c012880dd17', '740643dd-fbdd-4ffb-a2a3-91a0d631fa1a', 'a1d77bd4-dce9-4648-b7e6-35c9b1986e30', 'bb47c12c-5f11-4e88-a228-093d93876b10', 'c1885030-870c-4fcb-8573-31faa93c7b25', 'e0cab394-4bf8-45d5-b60f-c12e9b2d9cd2', 'efb6014a-c9c8-4581-995a-21a44272d460', 'f210e4ac-d76b-4d75-9dd5-ab3954bcaa32']",An efficient placement and routing technique for fault-tolerant distributed embedded computing,ACM Transactions in Embedded Computing Systems,2009

227,Abstract   The paper presents modified idea of program execution in PLCs. Instead of serial cyclic execution of control program event-driven execution is proposed. Suggested approach to program execution allows for selective execution of program parts or tasks provided calculation condition for this part has changed since last time. There only these blocks from entire program are executed whose variables have changed since last calculation.

228,In this paper we present a new method to show that a principal homogeneous space of the Jacobian of a curve of genus two is nontrivial. The idea is to exhibit a Brauer-Manin obstruction to the existence of rational points on a quotient of this principal homogeneous space. In an explicit example we apply the method to show that a specific curve has infinitely many quadratic twists whose Jacobians have nontrivial Tate-Shafarevich group.,"['Adam Logan', 'Ronald van Luijk']",ee8d6e09-56ef-44ea-919f-d2a6dc21297b,50,['c0f6f280-041e-4378-890c-40f62ba02ba8'],Nontrivial elements of Sha explained through K3 surfaces,Mathematics of Computation,2009
229,"Technological innovation and the growth of the internet as an electronic medium have led to the emergence of online travel distribution channels. The present research investigates the extent to which Greek hotels had developed the electronic customer relationship marketing (e-CRM). The study verifies the practices that frequently appear in relationship marketing process within online operations or whether their internet presence mainly depends on the basic actions of 'supplying information' and 'reservations'. Also, it investigates the effects of e-CRM system on customer loyalty and satisfaction as well as the impact of relationship marketing practices to customer retention and acquisition. They have understood the importance of using electronic channels instead of traditional ones to implement their marketing strategies. Thus, e-CRM system has assisted hotel business to manage more effectively their reservations and serve their customers as fast and as effective as possible. They did not seem to apply many of the relationship marketing strategies to emphasise customer retention and continual satisfaction because of difficulties in staff training.",['Irene Samanta'],1d629fb7-baeb-42b6-9918-533bb95e4e81,50,"['90653128-a91c-490e-9ffc-1fdb53631c50', 'd70b59b0-b2eb-41dc-95f2-6cf5b0018c32']",The Impact of e-Customer Relationship Marketing in Hotel Industry,world summit on the knowledge society,2009
230,"There is a growing trend to use general-purpose operating systems like Linux in embedded systems. Previous research focused on using compaction and specialization techniques to adapt a general-purpose OS to the memory-constrained environment, presented by most, embedded systems. However, there is still room for improvement: it has been shown that even after application of the aforementioned techniques more than 50% of the kernel code remains unexecuted under normal system operation. We introduce a new technique that reduces the Linux kernel code memory footprint, through on-demand code loading of infrequently executed code, for systems that support virtual memory. In this paper, we describe our general approach, and we study code placement algorithms to minimize the performance impact of the code loading. A code, size reduction of 68% is achieved, with a 2.2% execution speedup of the system-mode execution time, for a case study based on the MediaBench II benchmark suite.","['Dominique Chanet', 'Javier Cabezas', 'Enric Morancho', 'Nacho Navarro', 'Koen De Bosschere']",ac7b21ca-7221-44bf-ad06-c4e9d5623997,50,[],Linux kernel compaction through cold code swapping,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2009

232,"We study the conditional sojourn time distributions of processor sharing (PS), foreground background processor sharing (FBPS) and shortest remaining processing time first (SRPT) scheduling disciplines on an event where the job size of a customer arriving in stationarity is smaller than exactly k≥0 out of the preceding m≥k arrivals. Then, conditioning on the preceding event, the sojourn time distribution of this newly arriving customer behaves asymptotically the same as if the customer were served in isolation with a server of rate (1−ρ)/(k+1) for PS/FBPS, and (1−ρ) for SRPT, respectively, where ρ is the traffic intensity. Hence, the introduced notion of conditional limits allows us to distinguish the asymptotic performance of the studied schedulers by showing that SRPT exhibits considerably better asymptotic behavior for relatively smaller jobs than PS/FBPS.","['Predrag R.

233,"Jamming-resistant broadcast communication is crucial for safety-critical applications such as emergency alert broadcasts or the dissemination of navigation signals in adversarial settings. These applications share the need for guaranteed authenticity and availability of messages which are broadcasted by base stations to a large and unknown number of (potentially untrusted) receivers. Common techniques to counter jamming attacks such as Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) and Frequency Hopping are based on secrets that need to be shared between the sender and the receivers before the start of the communication. However, relying broadcast anti-jamming communication on either secret pairwise or group keys suffers from serious and sometimes even unsolvable scalability and key-setup problems or from weak jamming-resistance, respectively. In this work, we therefore propose a solution called Uncoordinated DSSS (UDSSS) that enables spread-spectrum anti-jamming broadcast communication without the requirement of shared secrets. It is applicable to broadcast scenarios in which receivers hold a certificate of the sender’s public key, but do not share a secret key with it. UDSSS can handle an unlimited amount of receivers while being secure against malicious receivers. We analyze the security and latency of UDSSS and complete our work by an experimental evaluation on a prototype implementation.",['Christina Pöpper'],91a74351-c4c1-431b-b0a2-a1b8ea2b089d,50,[],Jamming-resistant broadcast communication without shared keys,,2009

237,"The aim of this work is to study the diffractive properties of a sinusoidal phase grating for incorporation as a pattern projection element in a multisource and multicamera phase-shifting profilometric system. Two challenges should be overcome for successful operation of such a system, which are connected to inherent limitations of the phase-shifting algorithm--requirements for a sinusoidal fringe profile and for equal background and contrast of fringes in the recorded patterns. As a first task, we analyze the frequency content of the projected fringes in the Fresnel diffraction zone for parallel and divergent light illumination at different grating parameters and wavelengths. As a second task, we evaluate the systematical errors due to higher harmonics and multiwavelength illumination. Finally, operation of the four-wavelength profilometric system is simulated, and the error of the profilometric measurement evaluated. The results of test measurements are also presented.","['Elena Stoykova', 'Jana Harizanova', 'Ventseslav Sainov']",6b95af88-69ec-43ae-bf75-06ede350ce16,50,[],Pattern projection with a sinusoidal phase grating,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,2009

242,"This study investigates factors that affect usage changes in mobile data services (MDS). First, we conducted an exploratory study based on 378 survey responses to learn about important decision factors of MDS usage. It revealed a discrepancy between the forces influencing usage increase and those of usage decrease. Based on the findings from the exploratory study and Hertzberg’s two-factor theory, we postulated information quality as the motivator and system quality as the de-motivator of MDS usage. Then, we undertook a confirmative study on the respective roles of these factors in encouraging and discouraging the usage of MDS. We proposed a research model and empirically tested our hypotheses with partial least square (PLS) analysis based on 478 responses from MDS users. Information quality (as a motivator) was positively associated with MDS usage increase, but system quality (as a de-motivator) was not. Also, system quality was negatively associated with usage decrease, but information quality was not. Last, their association was partially moderated by the type of motivation for using MDS. Information quality had a stronger influence on MDS usage increase when the main motive was utilitarian rather than hedonic.","['Sanghoon Lee', 'Bongsik Shin', 'Ho Geun Lee']",93a2c909-a3e2-436f-8cf5-1050105dc93b,40,"['0a5567c5-7a18-4e16-9f53-a79c9f21e32d', '1f314048-efb8-4284-b96f-73dc97ec812c', '26f1c294-bc3c-4a76-873c-1aab459cba0f', '3a0625ef-9080-47c6-bc06-13ef4354f3b0', '3ce72c49-70e7-4119-9cf3-8e5e20d7fbd3', '48781111-6d37-40ba-af55-6ff34568dea7', '5065a688-aab6-4f5a-9d07-87ba6f94e12e', '5ec438f1-85d4-4bb4-8309-6be1b1beb57a', '6125c9e2-315b-45b4-a5e6-aaff297903fc', '633d48bc-d0c2-4de0-a5eb-384398fdd3b5', '6609e7a0-e4ac-4fba-b9a5-e4f068b0fd48', '6696e79d-4f03-439c-a6b6-c49ff5eebc9d', '6d3a2191-0e7a-42db-a5f4-e8307c2e5706', '6d72c90a-8965-4a97-9e50-203a9b83bef7', '7492dac2-f4aa-4e5e-b8c1-d17e97466436', '75dcec26-4cc6-4390-af60-e46881229f2f', '7801a668-9528-439e-a90e-17fd75cbc567', '7c898eb1-30f4-47c5-9915-29c5cf8718fd', '85e6dc1d-5459-4f44-b333-d0a50cf2c090', '9b213a3e-4cef-4a84-aa3e-660db3763e7a', '9d912297-e52f-4ab6-add4-633e0f263933', 'b541380f-8e36-4fd8-91b3-04cf1f8d2736', 'b57a5d36-508d-4885-9d14-b802dcf50a1a', 'c5b280d6-5047-4296-99f2-724efbd7808c', 'd2f8e7b6-6290-486c-981b-44db12bce30e', 'd5c2444a-a873-4f12-afe6-a7770497ae15', 'e09d1b46-2b09-468d-9967-113769c4d39b', 'f68ae4e1-fdb5-4bdc-a457-c86712ba2cb6', 'f77240e7-7bff-4496-907b-f31675cc9b90']",Understanding Post-adoption Usage of Mobile Data Services: The Role of Supplier-side Variables,Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies,2009

246,"This paper presents a new switching adaptive control strategy for nonlinear systems with uncertainties on discrete finite sets. Differently to multiple model supervisory control, switching adaptive control needs no estimators for switching decisions. The switching logic is designed based on the relationship between passivity (or more generally dissipativity) and the adaptive systems, such that in the process of switching control, the transient boundary can be guaranteed by appropriately switching the parameter estimate. This makes it possible to apply the strategy in nonlinear systems modelled in local regions in the state space. Simulation will be employed to show the effectiveness of the approach.","['Tengfei Liu', 'David J.

For solving this problem we propose a so-called Beam-ACO algorithm, which is a hybrid method that combines ant colony optimization with beam search. In general, Beam-ACO algorithms heavily rely on accurate and computationally inexpensive bounding information for differentiating between partial solutions. In this work we use stochastic sampling as an alternative to bounding information. Our results clearly demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is currently a state-of-the-art method for the tackled problem.","['M Ibanez', 'Christian Blum', 'Dhananjay R. Thiruvady', 'Andreas T.

In this paper we propose a formulation based on a well known model used in haplotype inference: pure parsimony. We exhibit exact solutions of the problem by providing polynomial-time algorithms for some restricted cases and a fixed-parameter algorithm for the general case. These results are based on some interesting combinatorial properties of a graph representation of the solutions. Moreover we propose a heuristic and produce an experimental analysis showing that it scales to real-world instances taken from the HapMap project.,"['Paola Bonizzoni', 'Gianluca Della Vedova', 'Riccardo Dondi', 'Yuri Pirola', 'Romeo Rizzi']",686101d0-513f-4aa5-b959-d09e8aff04ab,7,"['33271a83-8a83-4048-bad8-ba05cdd31da6', '56e357b5-025c-4adf-9686-ce0d0f68fd4b', '9cafcd39-1a92-4b65-b5eb-d4edde120716', 'a17df13d-f0fa-491f-a5f1-862b06e908c7', 'a7bbfcc5-8a1a-40b8-9aba-44e5154e7f5d', 'c8adf904-a632-4721-97ff-7a41f2e16866', 'c9061026-81e7-4bb1-aaf0-852910bc0eca', 'e5e7adc8-eb2e-48fa-b666-23437ebf0ebe', 'f8c622e3-2434-4714-9504-82374c6ce7c7', 'fa8db255-f216-42d3-ab07-c674eb988082']",Pure Parsimony Xor Haplotyping,international symposium on bioinformatics research and applications,2009

251,"Aberrantly regulated cell motility is a hallmark of cancer cells. A hybrid agent-based model has been developed to investigate the synergistic and antagonistic cell motility-impacting effects of three microenvironment variables simultaneously: chemoattraction, haptotactic permission, and biomechanical constraint or resistance. Reflecting distinct cell-specific intracellular machinery, the cancer cells are modeled as processing a variety of spatial search strategies that respond to these three influencing factors with differential weights attached to each. While responding exclusively to chemoattraction optimizes cell displacement effectiveness, incorporating permission and resistance components becomes increasingly important with greater distance to the chemoattractant source and/or after reducing the ligand's effective diffusion coefficient. Extending this to a heterogeneous population of cells shows that displacement effectiveness increases with clonal diversity as characterized by the Shannon index. However, the resulting data can be fit best to an exponential function, suggesting that there is a level of population heterogeneity beyond which its added value to the cancer system becomes minimal as directionality ceases to increase. Possible experimental extensions and potential clinical implications are discussed.","['L. Leon Chen', 'Le Zhang', 'J. U. Yoon', 'Thomas S.

The authors propose an alternative method of porting a design from a vendor-independent synthesis tool to a vendor system, for completing the implementation stage. The method utilises a special style of VHDL modelling, so the description is universal and comprehendible to a human. Efficiency of the method was verified by experiments carried out using academic software, and leading commercial tools.","['Robert Czerwinski', 'Józef Kulisz']",a7aba097-6b1b-41a2-a544-c241c87c54d8,1,"['e76d3583-65cb-4013-968d-59dc5e5f1352', 'f6f7d1cc-bb42-4bd3-8bd9-0410df33a7c4']",State machine description oriented towards effective usage of vendor-independent synthesis tools.,,2009
256,"Abstract   Thomason and Chung, Graham and Wilson were the first to investigate systematically some properties of quasi-random graphs. They have stated several quite disparate properties of random-like graphs and established their equivalence.  Simonovits and Sos introduced a new  hereditary  property that is equivalent to the other quasi-random properties. For a small fixed graph  F , a graph  G  on  n  vertices is said to have the Simonovits-Sos Property SSP if for every set   X  ⊆  V  (  G  )  , the number of labeled copies of  F  in   G  [  X  ]   is given by    2   −  e  (  F  )      |  X  |    v  (  F  )    +  o  (   n   v  (  F  )    )  .

Both variable sampling times anddelays must be considered during the control design in orderto avoid instability and performance loss. In this paper, it isshown that predictive control methods, based on continuoustime models, can be used to stabilize nonlinear systems underboth non-equidistant sampling times and delays. Furthermore,it is outlined how sensors and control sampling instants canbe actively utilized such that the control signal is updated onlywhen necessary.

274,"A popular manufacturing technique is clamshell casting, where liquid is poured into a cast and the cast is removed by a rotation once the liquid has hardened. We consider the case where the object to be manufactured is modeled by a polyhedron with combinatorial complexity n of arbitrary genus. The cast consists of exactly two parts and is removed by a rotation around a line in space. The following two problems are addressed: (1) Given a line of rotation l in space, we determine in O(nlog n) time whether there exists a partitioning of the cast into exactly two parts, such that one part can be rotated clockwise around l and the other part can be rotated counterclockwise around l without colliding with the interior of P or the cast. If the problem is restricted further, such a partitioning is only valid when no reflex edge or face of P is perpendicular to l, the algorithm runs in O(n) time. (2) An algorithm running in O(n 4log n) time is presented to find all the lines in space that allow a cast partitioning as described above. If we restrict the problem further and find all the lines in space that allow a cast partitioning as described above, such that no reflex edge or face of P is perpendicular to l, the algorithm’s running time becomes O(n 4 α(n)). All of the running times are shown to be almost optimal.","['Prosenjit Bose', 'Pat Morin', 'Michiel H. M.

290,"We consider labelled r-uniform hypertrees, 2≤r≤n, where n is the number of vertices in the hypertree. Any two hyperedges in a hypertree share at most one vertex and each hyperedge in an r-uniform hypertree contains exactly r vertices. We show that r-uniform hypertrees can be encoded in linear time using as little as n−2 integers in the range [1,n]. The decoding algorithm also runs in linear time. For general hypertrees, we require codes of length n+p−2 where p is the number of vertices belonging to more than one hyperedge in the given hypertree. Based on our coding technique, we show that there are at most $\frac {n^{(n-2)},-f(n,r)},{(r-1)^{(r-2)*\frac{n-1},{r-1},},},$distinct labelled r-uniform hypertrees, where f(n,r) is a lower bound on the number of labelled trees with maximum (vertex) degree exceeding $(r-1)+\frac {n-1},{r-1},-2$. We suggest a counting scheme for determining such a lower bound f(n,r).","['Saswata Shannigrahi', 'Sudebkumar Prasant Pal']",cc95c33b-26ff-4285-b21a-5df243d0c01f,0,['f4a39206-1b9d-4a73-9f46-e13037554316'],Efficient Prüfer-Like Coding and Counting Labelled Hypertrees,Algorithmica,2009

298,"Grids today generally assume that concurrent network connections are possible among many processors attached to high-capacity networks. However, inter-network boundaries dividing independent institutions often have firewalls, typically to restrict how many and which ports are accessible. In some cases, ports are opened indefinitely for Grid applications, but this compromises security significantly. On the other hand, solutions that manage port openings in an ad-hoc manner for applications are non-trivial to implement. An alternative firewall traversal technique is required that will provide manageable openings with less complexity involved. This is possible through proxies and managed tunnels using ports already authorized across the firewalls. We have developed a transparent connectivity mechanism for this, called Remus, which reroutes Grid connections through a tunnel on ports allowed across firewalls. However, a single tunnel presents a performance bottleneck. In this paper, we present the method by which Remus distributes several connections over multiple tunnels, improving throughput as a result. Rerouting wrappers hide the tunneling from applications, intercepting outgoing connections and rerouting them transparently. Wellknown and mature tools and protocols, such as SSH and/or SOCKS, are utilized, instead of imposing customized, non-standard mechanisms. Results of our experiments are also presented for large file transfers over a Globus-based Grid that uses Remus.","['Jefferson Tan', 'David Abramson', 'Colin Enticott']",e5f04a93-f7bb-4937-a82b-5b7dc50299ad,0,[],Optimizing tunneled grid connectivity across firewalls,,2009

In our approach the ultrasonic radio-frequency (RF) signal is considered as a sequence affected by Intersymbol Interference (ISI) and AWG noise. In order to reduce the computational cost, the estimation is performed with a reduced-state Viterbi algorithm. The channel effect is estimated in two different ways: either measuring the transducer response with an experimental setting or with blind homomorphic techniques. We observed an enhancement in image quality with respect to different metrics. Extensive tests were made to estimate the quantization alphabet that gives the best performances.","['A. Palladini', 'N.

For RTES in control domain this metrics is insufficient and needs to be extended with control performance metrics. We propose a methodology to evaluate control performances taking into account several RT software implementations on different hardware. This methodology relies on a bridge that we have defined to make a link between a RTES design tool (MoDEST) and a HW-SW system-level modeling tool (ASyMod).

Every time a user is authenticated by totally different password. The noisy password constitute of several parts, the actual password and additional noisy parts that are well studied to generate different passwords almost every time a user wants to authenticate himself.

326,"Abstract   More and more scanners of movement and position are used in biomedicine. Number of these scanners areincreasing continually, so there is an idea to integrate monitoring of actimetry and ECG. By analyzing these two important signals, especially verification of their relationship we can find a wide use in the systems of home care, but also in diagnostics of various heart diseases.  The next work describes the temperature measuring methods for patients and an environment. The body temperature is measured by the resistance thermistor. Its analog output has to be suitably processed. The signal is modified and digitalized. The signal is evaluated in the FPGA and used for the patient's diagnosis. For the environment's temperature measuring is used a digital thermometer, which communicates with the FPGA.","['Martin Augustynek', 'Lukás Cajka', 'Vladimir Kasik']",1f8e98a2-d8bc-4fa3-a090-ceb031b5f08f,0,[],"Measurement, signal processing and visualisation of actimetry, electrocardiography and body temperature.",,2009

334,"This paper provides new results about efficient arithmetic on Jacobi quartic form elliptic curves, y 2 = d x 4 + 2 a x 2 + 1. With recent bandwidth-efficient proposals, the arithmetic on Jacobi quartic curves became solidly faster than that of Weierstrass curves. These proposals use up to 7 coordinates to represent a single point. However, fast scalar multiplication algorithms based on windowing techniques, precompute and store several points which require more space than what it takes with 3 coordinates. Also note that some of these proposals require d = 1 for full speed. Unfortunately, elliptic curves having 2-times-a-prime number of points, cannot be written in Jacobi quartic form if d = 1. Even worse the contemporary formulae may fail to output correct coordinates for some inputs. This paper provides improved speeds using fewer coordinates without causing the above mentioned problems. For instance, our proposed point doubling algorithm takes only 2 multiplications, 5 squarings, and no multiplication with curve constants when d is arbitrary and a = ±1/2.","['Huseyin Hisil', 'Kenneth Koon-Ho Wong', 'Gary Carter', 'Edward Dawson']",767014bf-e2d3-4242-8afc-0c6464869f0b,0,[],Jacobi quartic curves revisited,,2009

336,"In cooperative games, the core is the most popular solution concept, and its properties are well known. In the classical setting of cooperative games, it is generally assumed that all coalitions can form, i.e., they are all feasible. In many situations, this assumption is too strong and one has to deal with some unfeasible coalitions. Defining a game on a subcollection of the power set of the set of players has many implications on the mathematical structure of the core, depending on the precise structure of the subcollection of feasible coalitions.

344,"In this paper, we consider the dynamics and competition between two software platforms. One is Open Source and is produced by an OS community and the other is based on proprietary software produced by a monopoly. Potential users can adopt one of the two platforms in order to fill specific needs (develop and sell new applications based on the platform). For that, they use the services of specialized firms that are in charge of developing the application on one platform. In this context, we first ask whether the coexistence of these two development models can yield to a stable outcome i.e. an outcome in which the market share of the two platform tends to be constant over time. To do so, we consider the static issue first and then use a simple dynamic system. The dynamics comes from the development efforts of the proprietary or of the OS platform that are spillovers and are capitalized in a knowledge base period after period. In most cases, the coexistence is not stable and ends up with an unique platform. From this baseline, we then consider different strategies for the editor. A first strategy is for the editor to “show the code” of its software. Reuse is here forbidden, yet this first degree of “openness” enable developing more compatible products. A second strategy is to allow for change strategically the compatibility degree between the proprietary and OS platform. In both cases, we study consider this issue in a dynamic framework and study whether a mixed industry may be sustainable in the long run.","['Eric Darmon', 'Dominique Torre']",e8234a94-c1ab-4918-b3bb-77e7151641eb,0,[],Open source and commercial software platforms: Is coexistence a temporary or a sustainable outcome?,,2009

358,"Simple games are a powerful tool to analyze decision-making and coalition formation in social and political life. In this paper, we present relation-algebraic models of simple games and develop relational algorithms for solving some basic problems of them. In particular, we test certain fundamental properties of simple games (being monotone, proper, respectively strong) and compute specific players (dummies, dictators, vetoers, null players) and coalitions (minimal winning coalitions and vulnerable winning coalitions). We also apply relation-algebra to determine central and dominant players, swingers and power indices (the Banzhaf, Holler-Packel and Deegan-Packel indices). This leads to relation-algebraic specii¬ cations, which can be executed with the help of the BDD-based tool RelView after a simple translation into the tool's programming language. In order to demonstrate the visualization facilities of RelView we consider an example of the Catalonian Parliament after the 2003 election.","['Rudolf Berghammer', 'Agnieszka Rusinowska', 'Harrie C.

384,"In this paper, we propose a flexible dialogue mechanism through which a set of agents can establish a coherent set of public beliefs. Flexibility and coherence are achieved by decomposing the dialogue mechanism into two parts, a backbone protocol and a set of conversation policies. The backbone protocol maintains the set of arguments put forward by the agents, and each agent uses a pre-agreed argumentation theory to extract a set of public beliefs from this set of arguments. The flexibility is achieved by distributing the other functions of the dialogue mechanism among a set of conversation policies, some of which are public and some of which are private to each agent.","['Yuqing Tang', 'Simon Parsons']",e63924e8-4418-48b2-87fc-fccf30237b8c,0,"['087a3e93-6ebc-4c51-b6f2-580f1a03059e', '175e32fd-158b-495c-bbff-9562246edbc3', '1ac97a35-5768-450d-a53d-22f4a55b8d4d', '1c7ddbd7-046a-4333-aa6b-c4ce698d6fad', '229678b1-c7b0-419b-a3ac-a9b4a1530c14', '2508da44-7215-4583-9526-68fe434842ba', '395999e0-952b-4281-bc30-5c79744ca30c', '5c653708-a365-4e97-bcdf-e7cb0b9c3b72', '611d1d96-bf6c-4ebe-a92e-915fe461474e', '64c42a22-cee2-4a54-8e37-5b9380f3749b', '6f5dbef6-aaa9-4ac3-9795-26eb82225a0a', '7041ce86-0cc7-4997-809c-2e15c85885e2', '8131ee78-7e49-45d8-ba2d-956fdde231dd', '85ab0381-32c5-476b-9adf-f4ad08ae0968', 'a1473381-a6a0-48c3-825b-78b0068f8240', 'a812a62d-305d-485d-b2d0-99da602cb219', 'afb0cad9-e257-4e57-b9b2-e317a2a64011', 'c5c3186f-8cc8-46ed-a43a-157a7c1025bf', 'd42a2c06-792d-4e3b-96ae-efd54a387da7', 'e171aedb-bd7a-47e1-9f5a-d3caf19f48ba', 'f3d4fdb5-c236-4cad-9685-018f1ce97c06', 'fe81dc83-4b15-467c-b4c1-a9a77dd33834']",A Dialogue Mechanism for Public Argumentation Using Conversation Policies,,2009

387,"To allocate and size capacitors in a distribution system, an optimization algorithm, called Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO), is employed in this paper. The objective is to minimize the transmission line loss cost plus capacitors cost. During the optimization procedure, the bus voltage, the feeder current and the reactive power flowing back to the source side should be maintained within standard levels. To validate the proposed method, the semi-urban distribution system that is connected to bus 2 of the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) is used. This 37-bus distribution system has 22 loads being located in the secondary side of a distribution substation (33/11 kV). Reducing the transmission line loss in a standard system, in which the transmission line loss consists of only about 6.6 percent of total power, the capabilities of the proposed technique are seen to be validated.","['Iman Ziari', 'Gerard Ledwich', 'Arindam Ghosh', 'David Cornforth', 'Michael Wishart']",1b470f26-b83d-44ae-923b-5f62ea009f02,0,[],Optimal allocation and sizing of capacitors to minimize the transmission line loss and to improve the voltage profile,,2009
388,"textabstractPrior studies have emphasized that structural attributes are crucial to simultaneously pursuing exploration and exploitation, yet our understanding of antecedents of ambidexterity is still limited. Structural differentiation can help ambidextrous organizations to maintain multiple inconsistent and conflicting demands; however, differentiated exploratory and exploitative activities need to be mobilized, coordinated, integrated, and applied. Based on this idea, we delineate formal and informal senior team integration mechanisms (e.g., contingency rewards and social integration) and formal and informal organizational integration mechanisms (e.g., cross-functional interfaces and connectedness) and examine how they mediate the relationship between structural differentiation and ambidexterity. Overall, our findings suggest that the previously asserted direct effect of structural differentiation on ambidexterity operates through informal senior team (i.e., senior team social integration) and formal organizational (i.e., cross-functional interfaces) integration mechanisms. Through this richer explanation and empirical assessment, we contribute to a greater clarity and better understanding of how organizations may effectively pursue exploration and exploitation simultaneously to achieve ambidexterity.","['Justin Jansen', 'Michiel Tempelaar', 'Frans van den Bosch', 'Henk W.

Yet, there is an inherent difficulty in deciding which principals should have access to user's information or actions, without requiring them to constantly manage their privacy settings. We propose to extract automatically such privacy settings, based on the policy that information produced within a social context should remain in that social context, both to ensure privacy as well as maximising utility. A machine learning approach is used to extract automatically such social contexts, as well as a tentative evaluation.

426,"The Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, in cooperation with Stanford University's Department of Computer Science, was pleased to present the 2009 Spring Symposium Series, held Monday through Wednesday, March 23–25, 2009 at Stanford University. The titles of the nine symposia were Agents that Learn from Human Teachers, Benchmarking of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning Systems, Experimental Design for Real-World Systems, Human Behavior Modeling, Intelligent Event Processing, Intelligent Narrative Technologies II, Learning by Reading and Learning to Read, Social Semantic Web: Where Web 2.0 Meets Web 3.0, and Technosocial Predictive Analytics. The goal of the Agents that Learn from Human Teachers was to investigate how we can enable software and robotics agents to learn from real-time interaction with an everyday human partner. The aim of the Benchmarking of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning Systems symposium was to initiate the development of a problem repository in the field of qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning and identify a graded set of challenges for future midterm and long-term research. The Experimental Design symposium discussed the challenges of evaluating AI systems. The Human Behavior Modeling symposium explored reasoning methods for understanding various aspects of human behavior, especially in the context of designing intelligent systems that interact with humans. The Intelligent Event Processing symposium discussed the need for more AI-based approaches in event processing and defined a kind of research agenda for the field, coined as intelligent complex event processing (iCEP). The Intelligent Narrative Technologies II AAAI symposium discussed innovations, progress, and novel techniques in the research domain. The Learning by Reading and Learning to Read symposium explored two aspects of making natural language texts semantically accessible to, and processable by, machines. The Social Semantic Web symposium focused on the real-world grand challenges in this area. Finally, the Technosocial Predictive Analytics symposium explored new methods for anticipatory analytical thinking that provide decision advantage through the integration of human and physical models.","['Jie Bao', 'Uldis Bojars', 'Tanzeem Choudhury', 'Li Ding', 'Mark Greaves', 'Ashish Kapoor', 'Sandy Louchart', 'Manish Mehta', 'Bernhard Nebel', 'Sergei Nirenburg', 'Tim Oates', 'David L.

428,"The paper describes results of analysis of interoperability issues encountered when interconnecting systems that use heterogeneous communication interfaces. The initial analysis has been focused to issues faced when interconnecting heterogeneous fieldbuses. However the results obtained from the study are generally applicable to all systems that need to exchange information through incompatible interfaces using a broker that transforms data from one interface to the other. However, the research has shown that many interoperability problems can be eliminated by use of common concept for expression of sensor data regardless of the protocols used for the actual data exchange. The root cause of interoperability problems has been identified in the heterogeneity of concepts used for description of the reality. The authors argue, that common concept for sensor-actuator networks (SANETS) is needed to prevent unnecessary interoperability problems especially when building platforms for generic SANETS.","['Petr Fiedler', 'Zdenek Bradac', 'Ondrej Hyncica']",503aec63-55ec-457b-83e2-f163a0ce6593,0,['7d3726d8-21e5-4321-833d-dfde277c3693'],Interoperability in sensor-actuator networks,,2009

445,"Multi-cue integration has been researched extensively for robust visual tracking. Researchers aim to use multiple cues under the probabilistic methods, such as Particle Filtering and Condensation. On the other hand, Color-based Mean-Shift has been addressed as an effective and fast algorithm for tracking color blobs. However, this deterministic searching method suffers from objects with low saturation color, color clutter in backgrounds and complete occlusion for several frames. This paper integrates multiple cues into Mean-Shift algorithm to extend its application areas of the fast and robust deterministic searching method. A direct multiple cues integration method with an occlusion handler is proposed to solve the common problems in color-based deterministic methods. Moreover, motivated by the idea of tuning weight of each cue in an adaptive way to overcome the rigidity of the direct integration method, an adaptive multi-cue integration based Mean-Shift framework is proposed. A novel quality function is introduced to evaluate the reliability of each cue. By using the adaptive integration method, the problem of changing appearance caused by object rotation can be solved. Extensive experiments show that this method can adapt the weight of individual cue efficiently. When the tracked color blob is invisible for human bodies' rotation, the color cue is compensated by motion cue. When the color blob becomes visible again, the color cue will become dominating as well. Furthermore, the direct-cue-integration method with an occlusion handler is combined with the adaptive integration method to extend the application areas of the adaptive method to full occlusion cases.","['Hong Liu', 'Ze Yu', 'Hongbin Zha', 'Yuexian Zou', 'Lin Zhang']",6e99f20d-aeaf-439a-95ed-c8287be920ce,0,[],Robust human tracking based on multi-cue integration and mean-shift,international conference on intelligent computing,2009

458,"Genetic algorithms (GA) represent an algorithmic optimization technique inspired by biological evolution. A major strength of this meta-heuristic is its ability to explore the search space in independent parallel search routes rendering the algorithm highly efficient if implemented on a parallel architecture. Sequential simulations of GAs frequently result in enormous computational costs. To alleviate this problem, we propose a serial evolution strategy which results in a much smaller number of necessary fitness function evaluations thereby speeding up the computation considerably. If implemented on a parallel architecture the savings in computational costs are even more pronounced. We present the algorithm in full mathematical detail and proof the corresponding schema theorem for a simple case without cross-over operations. A toy example illustrates the operation of serial evolution and the performance improvement over a canonical genetic algorithm.","['Victor Fischer', 'Ana Maria Tomé', 'Elmar Lang']",d6ccfcec-b7f3-48bd-bd9a-c7255dc92c3d,0,"['6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3', 'd8d316f1-337f-4ab5-8df2-cdecf1f89f9f']",Serial Evolution,international work conference on the interplay between natural and artificial computation,2009

462,"Studies of cerebral asymmetry can open doors to understanding the functional specialization of each brain hemisphere, and how this is altered in disease. Here we examined hemispheric asymmetries in fiber architecture using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 100 subjects, using high-dimensional fluid warping to disentangle shape differences from measures sensitive to myelination. Confounding effects of purely structural asymmetries were reduced by using co-registered structural images to fluidly warp 3D maps of fiber characteristics (fractional and geodesic anisotropy) to a structurally symmetric minimal deformation template (MDT). We performed a quantitative genetic analysis on 100 subjects to determine whether the sources of the remaining signal asymmetries were primarily genetic or environmental. A twin design was used to identify the heritable features of fiber asymmetry in various regions of interest, to further assist in the discovery of genes influencing brain micro-architecture and brain lateralization. Genetic influences and left/right asymmetries were detected in the fiber architecture of the frontal lobes, with minor differences depending on the choice of registration template.","['Neda Jahanshad', 'Agatha D.

Indeed, while the populations on the shores are growing, the countryside is endangered involving the desertification. In this paper we shall present a methodology to build a distributed artificial intelligence based model dedicated to the countryside economy and its interactions with the growing touristic coastal areas through the flow of tourists. Organizing the economic system into a hierarchy, following a multi-agent approach, we build a generic model of each system's stakeholders from our observations. We propose a methodology to model the exchanges between the countryside's visitors and the local economy's players. Using a geographic information system, we explicit how to take advantage of the spatiotemporal ground data to fit the simulations to the specificities of each targeted site. Finally we present a first application on a Corsican case.","['Dominique Urbani', 'Marielle Delhom']",4db64fb6-3521-4709-8526-5f588ebf1ee1,0,[],Hybrid MAS GIS Mediterranean backcountry tourism economy modeling methodology,,2009

We intend to show in this paper how a physics concept such as entropy can be applied to an economic problem. In so doing, we demonstrate how information in the form of observable data and moment constraints are introduced into the method of Maximum relative Entropy (MrE). A general example of updating with data and moments is shown. Two specific econometric examples are solved in detail which can then be used as templates for real world problems. A numerical example is compared to a large deviation solution which illustrates some of the advantages of the MrE method.",['Adom Giffin'],551b3bc4-fc4a-4742-99c6-2291c8201407,0,[],From Physics to Economics: An Econometric Example Using Maximum Relative Entropy,,2009

First, it identifies configurations of ERP adopters that have similar needs and develop similar competencies. Second, it tests the hypothesis that, to maximize benefits from their ERP projects, organizations should align their ERP competence-building mechanisms with the ERP needs that arise from their operational environment. The analysis of a sample of manufacturing companies that implemented ERP between 1995 and 2001 uncovers four distinct configurations representing different degrees of fit between needs and competence-building mechanisms: the frugal ERP, the extensive business process reengineering (BPR), the adaptive ERP, and the straitjacket. The results support our hypothesis and suggest that the consequences of a misfit between needs and competence-building mechanisms are more severe for companies that operate in complex and dynamic environments and have informal organizational structures than for firms with rigid structures that operate in simple and stable environments.","['Andrea Masini', 'Luk N.

In order to solve the problem for sophisticated agents, we derive a modified HJB (Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman) equation.

500,"How to decompose the mixed pixels precisely and effectively for multispectral/hyperspectral remote sensing images is a critical issue for the quantitative remote sensing research. This paper proposes a new method for decomposition of mixed pixels of multispectral/hyperspectral remote sensing images. The proposed method introduces the algorithm of Bayesian self-organizing map (BSOM) into the problem of the decomposition of mixed pixels. It estimates Gaussian parameters by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler information metric, and finishes the unmixing with Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In order to obtain a high unmixing precision, we need to extend the range of Gaussian distributions, and thus we propose a 3σ variance adjustment method to solve this problem. In addition, the proposed unmixing model automatically satisfies two constraints which are demanded for the problem of the decomposition of mixed pixels: abundances non-negative constraint (ANC) and abundances summed-to-one constraint (ASC). Experimental results on simulated and practical remote sensing images demonstrate that the proposed method can get good unmixing results for the decomposition of mixed pixels and is more robust to noise than other methods.","['Lifan Liu', 'Bin Wang', 'Liming Zhang']",be75271a-b26d-4483-81be-bf9b996a71a2,0,[],Decomposition of mixed pixels based on bayesian self-organizing map and Gaussian mixture model,international conference on intelligent computing,2009

503,"The generalization error, or probability of misclassification, of ensemble classifiers has been shown to be bounded above by a function of the mean correlation between the constituent (i.e., base) classifiers and their average strength. This bound suggests that increasing the strength and/or decreasing the correlation of an ensemble's base classifiers may yield improved performance under the assumption of equal error costs. However, this and other existing bounds do not directly address application spaces in which error costs are inherently unequal. For applications involving binary classification, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, performance curves that explicitly trade off false alarms and missed detections, are often utilized to support decision making. To address performance optimization in this context, we have developed a lower bound for the entire ROC curve that can be expressed in terms of the class-specific strength and correlation of the base classifiers. We present empirical analyses demonstrating the efficacy of these bounds in predicting relative classifier performance. In addition, we specify performance regions of the ROC curve that are naturally delineated by the class-specific strengths of the base classifiers and show that each of these regions can be associated with a unique set of guidelines for performance optimization of binary classifiers within unequal error cost regimes.","['Ryan Prenger', 'Tracy D.

504,"A content-based audio retrieval method based Fuzzy c-Means algorithm with divergence kernel (FCM-DK) is proposed in this paper. FCM-DK is based on the Fuzzy c-Means algorithm and employs a kernel method for data transformation. The kernel method adopted in FCM-DK is used to transform the feature data of audio signals into a feature space of a higher dimensionality so that nonlinear problems residing in the input space can be linearly solved in the feature space. In order to deal with Gaussian probability density function (GPDF) data, a divergence-based kernel employing a divergence distance measure for its similarity measure is used for data transformation. The proposed method exploits the statistical nature of the audio data to improve the classification accuracy. Experiments and results on various data sets demonstrate that the proposed classification method outperforms conventional algorithms such as the traditional self-organizing map (SOM) and the Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) 20.83% and 17.5% in terms of accuracy.",['Dong-Chul Park'],a57dec53-3e9c-4e32-89e1-2c567e39f87e,0,[],Classification of audio signals using Fuzzy c-Means with divergence-based Kernel,international conference on intelligent computing,2009

The end-products can be split in two classes: few products with high volume demands and a large number of products with low-volume demands. In order to reduce inventory costs, it seems efficient to produce the high-volume products according to an MTS policy and the low volume products according to an MTO policy. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare the impact of the scheduling policy on the overall inventory costs, under customer lead-time service level constraints. We consider two policies: the classical FIFO policy and a priority policy (PR) which gives priority to low volume products over high volume products. We show that for some range of parameters, the PR rule can significantly outperform the FIFO rule. In these ranges, the service level constraints are satisfied by the PR rule with much lower inventory costs.","['Christian Van Delft', 'Yves Dallery']",208c88ff-63c2-4303-b8cc-5f05a10c21ed,0,[],Analysis and Optimization of a Combined Make-to-Stock and Make-to-Order Multiproduct Manufacturing System,,2009

The aim of this paper is to chose in favor or against the use of VaR but to add some more information to this discussion, especially from the estimation point of view.
