0,"We have developed and trained a convolutional neural network to automatically and simultaneously segment optic disc, fovea and blood vessels. Fundus images were normalized before segmentation was performed to enforce consistency in background lighting and contrast. For every effective point in the fundus image, our algorithm extracted three channels of input from the point’s neighbourhood and forwarded the response across the 7-layer network. The output layer consists of four neurons, representing background, optic disc, fovea and blood vessels. In average, our segmentation correctly classified 92.68% of the ground truths (on the testing set from Drive database). The highest accuracy achieved on a single image was 94.54%, the lowest 88.85%. A single convolutional neural network can be used not just to segment blood vessels, but also optic disc and fovea with good accuracy.","['Jen Hong Tan', 'U. Rajendra Acharya', 'Sulatha V.

1,"The capacity of a fixed Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel and the optimal transmission strategy under the total power (TP) constraint and full channel state information are well known. This problem remains open in the general case under individual per-antenna (PA) power constraints, while some special cases have been solved. These include a full-rank solution for the MIMO channel and a general solution for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel. In this paper, the fixed Gaussian MISO channel is considered and its capacity and optimal transmission strategies are determined in a closed form under the joint total and PA power constraints in the general case. In particular, the optimal strategy is hybrid and includes two parts: first is equal-gain transmission and second is maximum-ratio transmission, which are responsible for the PA and TP constraints, respectively. The optimal beamforming vector is given in a closed form and an accurate yet simple approximation to the capacity is proposed. Finally, the above results are extended to the MIMO case by establishing the ergodic capacity of fading MIMO channels under the joint power constraints when the fading distribution is right unitary-invariant (of which i.i.d. and semi-correlated Rayleigh fading are special cases). Unlike the fixed MISO case, the optimal signaling is shown to be isotropic in this case.",['Sergey Loyka'],48d14ad8-4f32-47a1-ac00-513f64675027,0,"['147cc7ee-cf84-4cf9-b2a0-ab2da2912ac8', '3b54332f-80cd-4cac-844e-13317c8f6b72', '3faa7bd0-ef1c-4d7d-8565-5dc35cb2eecb', '4aa45358-9b9a-4b54-a316-f558368b2be7', '4fa53477-ec74-45bb-8886-e1067726a72c', '6cab1305-61fb-4f5e-8c93-6ad0fcfc2792', '6e3d80cd-5c8d-492f-a103-5ddc309c5a1e', '748a2ab3-8b5f-4d0a-9e2d-af685089843a', '7749cb85-eb68-44a1-9ac0-23f993730067', '830d7342-5acd-42b6-b856-78bdec99f2a3', 'bf54b8fd-4097-4beb-89b4-dd65cbc025d2', 'fe6b3d04-f87f-458c-9857-89266f2f7cf9']",The Capacity of Gaussian MIMO Channels Under Total and Per-Antenna Power Constraints,IEEE Transactions on Communications,2017
2,"We have developed a neural network model capable of performing visual binding inspired by neuronal circuitry in the optic glomeruli of flies: a brain area that lies just downstream of the optic lobes where early visual processing is performed. This visual binding model is able to detect objects in dynamic image sequences and bind together their respective characteristic visual features—such as color, motion, and orientation—by taking advantage of their common temporal fluctuations. Visual binding is represented in the form of an inhibitory weight matrix which learns over time which features originate from a given visual object. In the present work, we show that information represented implicitly in this weight matrix can be used to explicitly count the number of objects present in the visual image, to enumerate their specific visual characteristics, and even to create an enhanced image in which one particular object is emphasized over others, thus implementing a simple form of visual attention. Further, we present a detailed analysis which reveals the function and theoretical limitations of the visual binding network and in this context describe a novel network learning rule which is optimized for visual binding.","['Brandon D.

3,"While many applications require models that have no acceptable linear approximation, the simpler nonlinear models are defined by polynomials. The use of genetic algorithms to find polynomial models from data is known as Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR). This paper introduces Evolutionary Polynomial Regression with Regularization, an algorithm extending EPR with a regularization term to control polynomial complexity. The article also describes a set of experiences to compare both flavors of EPR against other methods including Linear Regression, Regression Trees and Support Vector Regression. These experiments show that Evolutionary Polynomial Regression with Regularization is able to achieve better fitting and needs less computation time than plain EPR.","['Francisco Coelho', 'João Pedro Neto']",81d5d5f6-d602-439d-b912-124fbc46f76f,0,"['1b5be8d4-ad4a-4eee-8423-5b2909eb80b6', '1f56a49e-bfc9-42aa-8b7b-b277e891162f', '4a6f7350-3c1d-4014-95a7-2a0710c68b43', '5532e41c-6738-463d-bca6-e60425487919', '9fd5b3a5-5218-4e19-9441-2535440c0be0', 'b8feceda-d8f4-46f3-840e-937cc62952d5', 'b99a76ed-5ca1-45b2-bb16-f146b2621acb', 'c061069f-29d1-46d4-9974-dede8d5461f9', 'c5b72e8b-a08e-4b70-94db-d7d67568a81a', 'd28acb36-5766-4c1e-8d57-a55c2630bd90', 'da4f41ce-662e-4a71-936a-3593c70c71c3', 'dc5f48ef-d12a-4176-9888-7280863a80d2', 'e2ca9c88-b615-431e-9ed2-fc05792a373f', 'e407acd7-dfcf-4ee8-9140-6726c01abf4e', 'e72b68c5-3a1e-4f7e-af88-165b3a9af5f8', 'ffddc753-6424-44d9-ad24-908bffbeebb6']",A Method for Regularization of Evolutionary Polynomial Regression,Applied Soft Computing,2017
4,"In this work, a new stochastic computing technique is developed to study the nonlinear dynamics of Troesch’s problem by designing the mathematical models of Morlet Wavelets Artificial Neural Networks (MW-ANNs) optimized with Genetic Algorithm (GA) integrated with Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). The differential equation mathematical model for MW-ANNs are designed for Troesch’s system by incorporating a windowing kernel based on Morlet Wavelets as an activation function and these networks are constructed to define a fitness function of Troesch’s system in the mean squared sense. The unknown adjustable parameters of MW-ANNs are trained initially by an effective global search using GAs hybridized with SQP for rapid local refinement of the results. The proposed scheme is evaluated to solve the Troesch’s problems for small and large values of the critical parameter in the system. Comparison of the proposed results with standard reference solutions of Adams method shows good agreement. Validation of accuracy and convergence of the proposed scheme is made using statistical analysis based on a sufficiently large number of independent runs, this is done in terms of performance measures of mean absolute deviation and root mean squared error.","['Khalid Majeed', 'Zaheer Masood', 'Raza Samar', 'Muhammad Asif Zahoor Raja']",122e820c-f0fd-49ee-864f-bb64e382586a,0,"['03547ad3-a15b-4f10-a2ca-fbd0c930340c', '03cfadff-0d67-420b-9e32-7af0fffa76e2', '0a61b70a-0d1c-40d4-ba94-4dfaeb96ede6', '1b609691-c80e-4ebf-a92d-dc95b832e2ab', '1d6b7a53-60a1-4e67-87ff-930166bbaf95', '371a387a-f7a0-49eb-b1a5-78640a1a1908', '3f5e2523-2e9f-48eb-9e90-f5ee0a0e784a', '53bcd753-128d-40e8-b7a5-f48465056e6c', '556c386a-8f7e-426f-8aa0-fd0930ca3ad6', '62baf306-562b-40f9-9f5c-d1dc82beaf7a', '6fe4a9e7-0832-4869-92f0-483f3f051e1d', '7e80af39-9768-4dca-a9fa-81c93b3480e0', '83d6f0cf-4c5a-49fb-be92-a7338181cf38', '8b4124a0-0f75-45b4-9b26-0e32727764fd', '9eac67dd-a0d3-4824-a3d4-4336af570f6c', 'a6375b3d-5730-48e1-861d-8e4306beee8b', 'a80ac569-bdb9-47bc-ba00-6bac35e5965e', 'b4a7821a-a21b-46fd-a755-566bbbeb114e', 'b6835949-0f71-43e9-8522-5a05d31bf731', 'bf5a97d3-b079-4dce-bf54-2617a013b082', 'c786b4e0-bc68-4340-a659-147045c734e7', 'daea1e17-219c-4f86-9a71-49aed1acd8df']",A genetic algorithm optimized Morlet wavelet artificial neural network to study the dynamics of nonlinear Troesch’s system,Applied Soft Computing,2017

6,"The manuscript presents an efficient methodology based-on water cycle algorithm (WCA) to solve single and multiple objectives of economic load dispatch (ELD) aiming to generate the optimal value of the active generated power for each unit. Three objectives are adopted for optimisation either sequentially or concurrently; they are: i) fuel cost considering valve-ripple effect, ii) emission rate, and iii) total network loss. The generating unit prohibited zones along with ramp rate limits and generating unit power limits specify the inequality constraints of the problem while maintaining system power balance. Usually, optimisation of simultaneous multiple objectives produces a set of non-dominated Pareto-front solutions. To help the decision maker, the best comprise solution is carefully picked among optimal Pareto-front points. The proposed WCA-based methodology is demonstrated on three test cases with various complexities and under number of objective scenarios. Numerical results and further subsequent comparisons to other challenging optimisers indicate the viability and confirm the strength of the proposed WCA-based ELD method.","['M.A. Elhameed', 'Attia A.

7,"Calendar applications for small handheld devices are growing in popularity. This led us to develop DateLens, a novel calendar interface for PDAs designed to support complex tasks. It uses a fisheye representation coupled with compact overviews to give the big picture in a small space. The interface also gives users control over the visible time period, as well as supporting integrated search to discover patterns and outliers. Designed with device scalability in mind, DateLens currently runs on desktop computers as well as PDAs. Two user studies were conducted to examine the viability of DateLens as a replacement for traditional calendar visualizations. In the first study, non-PDA users performed complex tasks significantly faster with DateLens than with the Microsoft Pocket PC 2002 TM  calendar (using a PDA emulator). In addition, they rated DateLens as being easier to use than the default calendar application for a majority of the tasks. In the second study, the participants were expert Pocket PC users and the software was run on their own devices. Again, DateLens performed significantly faster for the complex tasks, and there were satisfaction differences favoring each calendar for different kinds of tasks. From these studies, it is clear that DateLens is superior for more complex tasks such as those associated with longer time periods. For daily event tracking, users familiar with the default Pocket PC calendar strongly preferred its daily view and behaviors.","['Benjamin B. Bederson', 'Aaron Clamage', 'Mary Czerwinski', 'George G.

12,"Established literature supports the notion that depressed individuals tend to be socially maladjusted and behave differently from those who aren't depressed. Yet, previous studies seem to overlook the influence of personality on behavior. Particularly, neuroticism may moderate the effect of depression on the way people behave. As one of the Big-Five factors of personality, neuroticism refers to a trait of one's capability to control emotional distress. Based on behavioral data from 393 Facebook users, current research demonstrates the interaction between depression and personality. Users engaged in activities at different levels of activities corresponding to their depression levels. Further, the effect of depression on social networking was regulated by personality: once neuroticism exceeded certain points, an increase in depression led to a decrease in social networking activities.","['Jieun Wee', 'Sooyeun Jang', 'Joonhwan Lee', 'Woncheol Jang']",25d8bd93-e7af-4321-9bb3-82e9c5330a53,0,"['0832d4c8-e233-4163-8e82-5fe9ea15efc1', '0ab3a04b-3b49-4b1c-895f-49e0bcdbedd3', '2508bcf2-a4a5-4681-acb3-3e2106fa1a13', '31b6568a-82f3-4389-a7cc-64cf219772e5', '35d67851-d71e-4bb0-bf03-a67132cbe9bd', '75687884-cb74-440c-a23e-de640a713242', '82151a72-8fc1-4616-986b-0a2b779035ce', 'bfb0ee2e-a5ed-40a3-a27d-a3f2bf0e5475', 'e2a0315c-ef1b-438c-a8c3-718e4af2c44f', 'f3f293a8-59ef-4e1f-ad07-3170c41c0f8c', 'f7fb89fc-d03d-49fd-a7a3-c3b7e0f440c4', 'fdfe8339-b31e-4805-96fa-4c6cdf5e5635']",The influence of depression and personality on social networking,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
13,"Temporal logic is a formal system for specifying and reasoning about propositions qualified in terms of time. It offers a unified approach to program verification as it applies to both sequential and parallel programs and provides a uniform framework for describing a system at any level of abstraction. Thus, a number of automated systems have been proposed to exclusively reason about either Computation-Tree Logic (CTL) or Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) in the infinite-state setting. Unfortunately, these logics have significantly reduced expressiveness as they restrict the interplay between temporal operators and path quantifiers, thus disallowing the expression of many practical properties, for example, “along some future an event occurs infinitely often.” Contrarily, CTLa, a superset of both CTL and LTL, can facilitate the interplay between path-based and state-based reasoning. CTLa thus exclusively allows for the expressiveness of properties involving existential system stabilization and “possibility” properties. Until now, there have not existed automated systems that allow for the verification of such expressive CTLa properties over infinite-state systems. This article proposes a method capable of such a task, thus introducing the first known fully automated tool for symbolically proving CTLa properties of (infinite-state) integer programs. The method uses an internal encoding that admits reasoning about the subtle interplay between the nesting of temporal operators and path quantifiers that occurs within CTLa proofs. A program transformation is first employed that trades nondeterminism in the transition relation for nondeterminism explicit in variables predicting future outcomes when necessary. We then synthesize and quantify preconditions over the transformed program that represent program states that satisfy a CTLa formula.#R##N##R##N#This article demonstrates the viability of our approach in practice, thus leading to a new class of fully-automated tools capable of proving crucial properties that no tool could previously prove. Additionally, we consider the linear-past extension to CTLa for infinite-state systems in which the past is linear and each moment in time has a unique past. We discuss the practice of this extension and how it is further supported through the use of history variables. We have implemented our approach and report our benchmarks carried out on case studies ranging from smaller programs to demonstrate the expressiveness of CTLa specifications, to larger code bases drawn from device drivers and various industrial examples.","['Byron Cook', 'Heidy Khlaaf', 'Nir Piterman']",f6eae117-7628-4696-80c0-fe64e19b264e,0,"['0209a42a-42f0-45e8-b021-fab0f9711f3f', '0a917be1-392c-4365-a347-2105af5a56ae', '0c4a7265-70a8-4570-9dc7-5b265131a2f2', '0dad80e3-8fd8-4d13-b5b7-3ddb969ed7b2', '179a29ef-760c-428b-9322-2e8e547184d8', '17a0d36a-8e95-49eb-8c0f-9f02bd2cdf88', '28b15182-9b07-41ad-b38f-dcf0a7ba85ca', '31a6e354-a25a-42ff-b22d-9742039155f6', '3307bb69-bbfa-49e6-85e3-57818aaa7eba', '385a4f4f-b76a-4c21-a8c1-73ea895a3594', '3f3e604c-7079-4dbe-8001-69780a6f1ce8', '43a1c6d1-7125-4999-88fe-5b580543ecbb', '6d2f0c43-cc16-4492-b81a-0fd3acc3db6e', '6f0c59b1-b351-4a0e-8cc6-b855c6e98a8c', '74e3fd8b-f955-4fde-aad8-0a705f05e27e', '76d4cc9f-d3ad-43dd-a05c-f05eff3d1b18', '77d2ea65-9174-464d-a871-60b33377035c', '79de76a0-072e-41a4-8353-411e4fb1c6a7', '82afb34a-cb4f-42e2-9438-fe181fcd5445', '8617ea57-7351-4907-a34e-a4da15ac6b01', '96780251-ae92-46d7-a686-b4a3a77910f7', '96fefc1f-ba26-4c31-b5d1-ca6d63dd5246', 'a3f4cd7e-0927-4def-95c1-705e322a1132', 'adfac482-f074-4de8-872d-30b4858db323', 'c00bbb49-6e29-4103-8883-55acd23c248b', 'c013a37b-8266-4812-b60e-8a2118a76847', 'c20d4bcd-0efc-47e8-8755-0430b16d25e3', 'ca74fc99-4a1e-4efc-a3eb-ccf0b02becb9', 'd8b8387d-8e40-49ca-bd7b-2b6696dd9bc5', 'de117766-fac4-424f-a316-7698767f50e2', 'efec2929-ab46-4a9a-b59f-1c5893253d7c', 'fc0ecdef-af82-4a4c-ad7a-b5c4b3a5300e']",Verifying Increasingly Expressive Temporal Logics for Infinite-State Systems,Journal of the ACM,2017
14,"Online rating systems play an important role in recommender systems. Collaborative filtering recommender systems are highly vulnerable to “shilling” attacks in reality. Although attack detection based on the attacks have been extensively researched over the last decade, the studies on this issue have not reached an end. Furthermore, only using the existing features is not easy to improve their detection performance. In this paper, we present an unsupervised detection method to defend such attacks, which consists of two stages. Based on the existing features of user and item, more effective features are selected using adaptive structure learning which takes advantage of adaptive local and global structure learning. In the first stage, suspected users are determined by exploiting a density-based clustering method based on the selected features. Then, the selected features of item are applied to find out suspicious items in order to further spot the concerned attackers based on the result of the first stage. Finally, the attackers can be detected. Extensive experiments on the MovieLens-100K dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compare to competing methods. It is noteworthy that discovering interesting findings including anomalous ratings and items on Amazon dataset also is investigated.","['Zhihai Yang', 'Zhongmin Cai', 'Yuan Yang']",74dc80a3-60c2-414a-9078-a0c603d6a135,0,"['042b8b35-41ed-4257-974e-94eabf457ff1', '0872861c-b573-45ba-b2f3-0e85109bb479', '0b5f5330-291b-443a-9ee5-dbc57d039b75', '0c697707-98e3-4fbe-9f6a-bfc056abc740', '101e21db-d6bd-4f28-a328-cf56610ef6ba', '12b758fe-7db2-4e6a-af66-029cf85662ce', '138cf387-dd9c-47b5-bcba-35eadadd4361', '1ac37faa-dfc6-4bd7-b801-1f65ab012116', '31ff82b4-66c6-4acc-ada4-9f3d552ca5f2', '36233442-141a-431d-bf1a-377ce1aceccf', '3e4b12b8-4329-4062-ba0f-46e49669d3c1', '413dd227-8af8-493a-a1a6-9d617069a6da', '445cfe83-1dd2-49f0-a1bc-844ca9e09d45', '4952fe24-124a-4857-b0a1-2e48ad5d3208', '4d19a303-4bd4-4bc2-9a81-5d7d2d214c41', '53c99422-2b79-4199-a6ec-f2bf68bc6c6d', '5b8f1688-b1bd-4cfb-90c7-9af5d2539bd1', '5da6c9de-be82-494f-9613-a379d46fd321', '63900812-de21-41fa-b96d-f93a86b758f8', '6dedc2ac-04a2-4533-80b8-d6af03e82da2', '7065a3be-3f90-42e9-bd20-8743eeb2c6a5', '70b3326d-1726-4182-89c1-bbe4866bc828', '7293c638-40eb-4c73-ba84-bce7508776a2', '77a38619-9597-421d-91b2-bd3c6b751636', '785fcd2f-ab8f-4265-ae49-b51086e0fc8d', '7a531f44-8bf5-4209-b650-9d1870143102', '7bd1eb40-e3d4-4e30-b841-da4d5febbf79', '7beca95c-37f2-4a19-bb62-76dd03c9b410', '7c079f2a-0a2a-4c5d-9ad6-198670d0d9bc', '7c7e32fb-0ddf-4f92-a817-26ccdb68b267', '7f2f12fd-aaab-4ace-a6aa-b6cc575622ab', '7fc6dcad-f1d2-4e1a-b3e2-9242b3f4d19d', '836bd471-9707-4f02-97bc-c03264a44014', '88b8bafe-64bb-4378-a932-1a0128c6c133', '96600f30-7c93-4834-9427-bd8c97b1ac51', '974b420e-1d47-4ed8-a6c3-61cddf0169f7', '9da4e013-845e-4c4e-8334-debd4858e720', 'a5169b59-3e91-413e-9b0a-1f5421642c4f', 'b06e6bf9-0ccf-4adf-bc20-f83f8121fa57', 'b684fa05-02ee-476f-bacd-225ca2425546', 'b8d9e95a-0017-4ee8-ba43-70162070f79a', 'bacec2e2-b795-4592-9b82-e6ae175dd7f0', 'bc9ec0e0-eb5b-4e12-b2e0-827ae54bcb45', 'd08d3817-0cfd-4a75-b18c-8d6899b48df9', 'd38e51f2-d4fd-455e-86ed-82e0fc28fc8d', 'd48b155a-f6a5-49c5-b5e2-23732bafe618', 'de98e939-7f73-4d2a-ae11-4739ec4e68b7', 'e45de0f8-6408-4732-a5a1-1f71ccf23f36', 'e5a163c2-468d-424e-b83c-e7a979c44c24', 'e6043f54-f347-4fab-b36a-7f7a19365cce', 'f31243f5-1bdb-4701-9b5b-a4a6e5a7aecb', 'feddae21-3c05-4743-80fa-b8e101f1b93f']",Spotting anomalous ratings for rating systems by analyzing target users and items,Neurocomputing,2017

This paper addresses a number of grid-based target searching problems in a single searcher-single target environment applicable to real-time scenarios and various approaches are introduced for modeling and analyzing the problems. The solutions derived from the proposed approaches facilitate the understanding of the problems in detail.

In the paper, a mobile sensor and a mobile object play the role of a searcher and a target, respectively. Later, the problem is viewed from a different dimension by representing it as a state transition diagram and a finite automaton to highlight the differences resulting from varying activities of the searcher and the target. This is further extended to key-based target searching with an aim to minimize the search time.

The proposed method is a subspace classifier based on functional projection, and the covariates affect the response function through the mean of a functional regression model.

A newly observed response function is classified into the optimally predicted class that has the minimal   L 2        L    2          distance between the observation and its projection onto the subspaces among all classes.

19,"Sport is one of the activities of human being where cooperative, competitive, self-learning and interactive environment helps in the overall improvement of the performance. These learning processes are very effective to regulate the players in a good direction as well as to enhance their capability of exploring the new techniques. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a popular stochastic optimization algorithm, used for solving real-world engineering problems. However, it usually suffers from local confinement and easily loses its diversity. In this paper, we have integrated the properties of sports with PSO algorithm and proposed an efficient player selection strategy based diversified PSO (EPS-dPSO), which improves the fitness and robustness of the technique without compromising the computational complexity of the algorithm. The properties of player selection is adopted to enhance the diversity within the search phase as well as to incorporate intense searching of the space. We have comprehensively evaluated the performance of proposed EPS-dPSO by applying it on standard benchmark problems. Experimental result shows that it not only tracks the global optimum within the small search interval but also able to obtain good result for large and asymmetrical search space and also insensitive to initialization of the problems. Further, tests are carried out on the benchmark functions from CEC2005, the large dimensional problems of CEC2008 and some real world problems from CEC2011. All the experimental results indicate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed EPS-dPSO compared to other traditional algorithms.","['Prativa Agarwalla', 'Sumitra Mukhopadhyay']",c533d7fd-37de-43bf-8e9c-3837bede498d,0,"['02aaf653-c8d8-4401-9b59-c67bf7b5b0be', '0f4982f0-0f02-4969-aca4-938cb4d2f27c', '1a48f00b-bc9e-40aa-978a-fa06d511bb8b', '28b53473-e1e3-4460-bf21-ff9238278c4e', '2ab7414f-4327-4539-902c-6be86947d1fb', '2e091ecf-0052-42d9-a1ac-0d29311c143a', '3bcbef34-05db-48b5-8d15-dcad36c4db59', '421b4cf0-0e39-4cd0-9eaf-4d6687d574aa', '502d348c-2cbc-4c1f-b1e1-ad6865477302', '5131173c-8195-44e3-bc95-1043b04ff531', '5c99da03-cc8a-4949-bbfe-017ecc165cc2', '739d47fc-2034-4018-b60d-397cd9b50331', '78391043-7872-4ff6-a886-bb7c6683b13b', '85679a9f-586c-457d-b575-e8de48a0fd68', '8e783b04-1192-4053-bbdf-e62b9940455b', '92042db2-4aa5-4ac1-8c6b-5209f8707997', '95dbd63a-a1ee-47c6-8d19-691372f193ba', '9f67e529-5330-4907-95f0-a1d01a652cf1', 'a40b2068-295c-4893-add2-1505844a3a12', 'b1a0abb7-da29-4bc9-bcfa-9768aaeb3fd5', 'b311e2d4-2c30-4b3a-880f-02d434d73d4e', 'c08460fa-5335-4445-be9b-046567af5c0b', 'c6491482-a274-4208-9dde-d093850a351d', 'cb7804dd-00ef-4a6d-9e29-3800b3de000b', 'cb7e42cd-bd7a-4b45-8feb-03b12e056909', 'd25abbad-637a-4fd4-ba89-0ca88c577aca', 'd79c2ce2-81ac-48fc-ad69-2081a0b0bac5', 'f5cc526f-6cd4-401e-aac1-416ac15aa146', 'fedd688e-442e-40fe-a385-7a425ceb964d']",Efficient player selection strategy based diversified particle swarm optimization algorithm for global optimization,Information Sciences,2017

21,"Background#R##N#Associating protein complexes to human inherited diseases is critical for better understanding of biological processes and functional mechanisms of the disease. Many protein complexes have been identified and functionally annotated by computational and purification methods so far, however, the particular roles they were playing in causing disease have not yet been well determined.#R##N#Results#R##N#In this study, we present a novel method to identify associations between protein complexes and diseases. First, we construct a disease-protein heterogeneous network based on data integration and laplacian normalization. Second, we apply a random walk with restart on heterogeneous network (RWRH) algorithm on this network to quantify the strength of the association between proteins and the query disease. Third, we sum over the scores of member proteins to obtain a summary score for each candidate protein complex, and then rank all candidate protein complexes according to their scores. With a series of leave-one-out cross-validation experiments, we found that our method not only possesses high performance but also demonstrates robustness regarding the parameters and the network structure. We test our approach with breast cancer and select top 20 highly ranked protein complexes, 17 of the selected protein complexes are evidenced to be connected with breast cancer.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#Our proposed method is effective in identifying disease-related protein complexes based on data integration and laplacian normalization.","['Zhiming Liu', 'Jiawei Luo']",cc3f44e7-bcab-4432-948a-060f4e47398d,0,"['0a64f97b-a569-46e5-bb0e-0b9a7976e1f7', '10aa00ac-d43f-44e1-86fd-857fccd9fc45', '1f9f15e6-34fd-4d92-83a9-e6871f9f5e76', '5b036000-9c72-489a-adcc-d1a49d628d03', '691c1540-ffbc-44f5-b813-1350a06c3519', '6efa5931-115c-46d2-b795-384e9eb7def5', '90a29882-e3c3-4aab-9d9f-d68a501467e6', 'af0e3d97-b1bb-4618-8f0a-229f02899e80', 'de1f2e60-36b9-41f8-acf9-ccf350395805', 'f2da6785-e4b0-42c6-b714-caf2844e48af', 'fb3aec94-7b20-4adf-8a46-62bee4f71fe7']",Genome-wide predicting disease-related protein complexes by walking on the heterogeneous network based on data integration and laplacian normalization,Computational Biology and Chemistry,2017
22,"Inducing adaptive predictive models in real-time from high throughput data streams is one of the most challenging areas of Big Data Analytics. The fact that data streams may contain concept drifts (changes of the pattern encoded in the stream over time) and are unbounded, imposes unique challenges in comparison with predictive data mining from batch data. Several real-time predictive data stream algorithms exist, however, most approaches are not naturally parallel and thus limited in their scalability. This paper highlights the Micro-Cluster Nearest Neighbour (MC-NN) data stream classifier. MC-NN is based on statistical summaries of the data stream and a nearest neighbour approach, which makes MC-NN naturally parallel. In its serial version MC-NN is able to handle data streams, the data does not need to reside in memory and is processed incrementally. MC-NN is also able to adapt to concept drifts. This paper provides an empirical study on the serial algorithm’s speed, adaptivity and accuracy. Furthermore, this paper discusses the new parallel implementation of MC-NN, its parallel properties and provides an empirical scalability study.","['Mark Tennant', 'Frederic T.

23,"This paper presents a general methodology to predict the fatigue life of the Package-on-Package (PoP) under random vibration loading by means of vibration tests and finite element (FE) simulation. The behavior of the critical solder joints of the PoP under vibration loading was accurately described by FE model using ANSYS software and confirmed by modal analysis and linear sweep tests. The stress-life (S-N) curve of the PoP solder joints was obtained by the sinusoidal fatigue vibration tests and FE simulations to characterize the fatigue properties of the PoP under vibration. The comparison of the S-N curves of the SAC305 solder joints in different structures indicates the S-N curve of the SAC305 solder joints depends on the package structure. With the same fatigue cycles, the stress levels for the current 3D package is the smallest compared with the other 2D package due to the stacked structure of the PoP. Spectrum analysis for the random vibration tests was performed by the FE simulations to acquire the stress response power spectral density (PSD) of the critical solder joint. A specific frequency domain approach based on the Palmgren-Miner's rule was established to predict the fatigue life of the PoP under random vibration. Results show that simulated fatigue life matches well with the random vibration test results, which implies that this approach could be a potential method for the predication of fatigue life of the 3D packaging under random vibration.","['Jiang Xia', 'Guoyuan Li', 'Bin Li', 'LanXian Cheng', 'Bin Zhou']",cb7beac9-3472-42c6-9ba7-76c1d737ce88,0,"['222c5abd-d3e7-46df-8ff9-541f0f3d7a44', '77495754-d72d-41b1-9927-f0ae2d46d3fd', '7ebd4c70-47a6-4afa-b3f6-4d3bd29215ef', '8c22cde3-e7b7-4088-be52-8bf65605385e', 'cf81b901-509c-4d9d-a890-0109ea030025']",Fatigue life prediction of Package-on-Package stacking assembly under random vibration loading,Microelectronics Reliability,2017
24,"With the development of 5G communication, the new non-orthogonal multi-carrier transmission technology has been paid more attention. A filtering operation is made on a group of continuous subcarriers in Universal-filtered multi-carrier (UFMC), making the orthogonality among the subcarriers no longer exist. Such feature has relaxed the strict constraint of synchronization between the various devices, and makes it more suitable for the needs of 5G. On the other hand, the non orthogonality causes the mutual interference among the subcarriers and sub-bands. If the interference is effectively reduced, the performance of UFMC can be improved. In this paper, the factor of true power ratio is proposed to evaluate the inter-band interference. Furthermore, with the specific filter parameters, an appropriate sub-band interval can reduce the energy interference between the sub-bands especially in the uplinks. Simulation result shows that the method can reduce the symbol error rate and improve the transmission performance of UFMC by deploying the sub-band with optimized interval. Especially in high SNR environment, the deployment of shorter filter and neighboring sub-bands shows a better performance.","['Sirui Duan', 'Xiang Yu', 'Rong Wang']",e4a4a163-6e53-45e6-9012-b6b340e3947d,0,"['0a4daa7d-4ef8-42d8-8b21-5278447c2eeb', '1bf91e0e-c1f3-4668-8932-4af711d12f82', '27322c3e-8f48-416f-82d8-43f86bdbc162', '34565e6d-d81a-499e-bb58-f173fe64e3eb', '5aeef63d-8891-4ec7-967c-3ed1b0c4b7fc', '5de2e74c-6a7d-4bbb-923a-e01ce496b1ce', '62224795-6a9f-471d-a1ff-7e066797f56d', '68443c87-da20-4fc6-8547-467b7bdb2633', '68be42ea-ab0d-4f85-ae98-b83d71c4966d', '720fe974-0aaa-4008-b01e-cc5e07b791ef', '7894c624-48a1-43b0-8239-25832ab3c129', '7c981ae3-8599-48b2-88ab-429c976a6826', '8720bbea-0008-459a-8521-beeaf6829c8d', 'af1ecae7-d059-4f98-8c99-80651890652d', 'b3122b66-35f1-4da4-b896-31058e16334a', 'b6b7e130-b395-45d8-8131-5224d479bc1c', 'ce5f7f87-ea3d-417d-835a-f8417c5dfc7e', 'cf6464f9-481e-45ca-9b65-16d123c0e608', 'e15b1c64-8510-451d-b1c3-868bef75717c', 'e16cde2b-ade6-44c7-a944-df22a0578c3d', 'ffb881d8-ba32-4384-9412-131163dbb48f']",Performance Analysis on Filter Parameters and Sub-bands Distribution of Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
25,"Many entries in the protein data bank (PDB) are annotated to show their component protein domains according to the Pfam classification, as well as their biological function through the enzyme commission (EC) numbering scheme. However, despite the fact that the biological activity of many proteins often arises from specific domain-domain and domain-ligand interactions, current on-line resources rarely provide a direct mapping from structure to function at the domain level. Since the PDB now contains many tens of thousands of protein chains, and since protein sequence databases can dwarf such numbers by orders of magnitude, there is a pressing need to develop automatic structure-function annotation tools which can operate at the domain level. This article presents ECDomainMiner, a novel content-based filtering approach to automatically infer associations between EC numbers and Pfam domains. ECDomainMiner finds a total of 20,728 non-redundant EC-Pfam associations with a F-measure of 0.95 with respect to a “Gold Standard” test set extracted from InterPro. Compared to the 1515 manually curated EC-Pfam associations in InterPro, ECDomainMiner infers a 13-fold increase in the number of EC-Pfam associations.

27,"We develop a novel numerical scheme to simulate electrostatic turbulence with kinetic electron responses in magnetically confined toroidal plasmas. Focusing on ion gyro-radius scale turbulences with slower frequencies than the time scales for electron parallel motions, we employ and adapt the bounce-averaged kinetic equation to model trapped electrons for nonlinear turbulence simulation with Coulomb collisions. Ions are modeled by employing the gyrokinetic equation. The newly developed scheme is implemented on a global   δf     δ  f        particle in cell code gKPSP. By performing linear and nonlinear simulations, it is demonstrated that the new scheme can reproduce key physical properties of Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) and Trapped Electron Mode (TEM) instabilities, and resulting turbulent transport. The overall computational cost of kinetic electrons using this novel scheme is limited to 200%–300% of the cost for simulations with adiabatic electrons. Therefore the new scheme allows us to perform kinetic simulations with trapped electrons very efficiently in magnetized plasmas.","['Jae-Min Kwon', 'Lei Qi', 'Soojin V. Yi', 'T. S.

29,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, we present a systematic approach to sketch map interpretation. The method decomposes the elements of a sketch map into a hierarchy of categories, from the material sketch map level to the non-material representational sketch map level, and then interprets the sketch map using the five formal representation spaces that we develop. These spaces (set, graph, metric and Euclidean) provide a tiered formal representation based on standard mathematical structures. We take the view that a sketch map bears information about the physical world and systematises this using extensions of existing formal ontologies. The motivation for this work is the partially automatic extraction and integration of information from sketch maps. We propose a set of ontologies and methods as a first step in the direction of a formalisation of partially automatic extraction and integration of sketch map content. We also see this work as a contribution to spatial cognition, where researchers externalise spatial kno...","['Jia Wang', 'Michael Worboys']",4d0f955f-a5ed-48ce-a6ce-373e1cc163dd,0,"['0543b313-502a-44f9-94dc-414da988b27f', '1bc1923c-5602-446a-83f8-c3ddbf401aa6', '1d4856b2-b130-4309-bb8d-59588eef085d', '2b7d3849-3689-4722-a489-36b3dfc06741', '2ef98ba4-96cf-4c7a-bc1e-0cfa4e044b0e', '3d7e2e59-f44e-4316-997b-94a173a4f47b', '5445bff5-b443-4f47-a87b-aebb064db931', '5afe7e3d-b669-4dee-916b-950b7c97a8ec', '66012375-7120-4fca-8dc1-64bef290a043', '66ee32f8-9fb2-4d0d-b70f-5c2a5efad0a2', '750b0ac1-2ac9-4273-a9c8-baad11e26fcd', '85bedce6-a25e-4ccd-bd3f-7ed4c96a60cb', '91e8670c-7d44-4197-a0d7-652e21ae72fb', '97a52626-43b4-469a-bdfd-bb99dd77f1b8', 'af96fd5a-b78a-4424-8e12-a854988fef6a', 'b00ab520-17d4-4b10-aed6-306d1f32f9f0', 'b2c845ec-995a-43eb-9ef7-c0e15bf87f6d', 'b9f53817-0aa0-4eee-afc9-525e4ab8b275', 'c0204cc6-06d4-4afb-aea9-c2fafc56c34a', 'fe87b234-5d15-4e83-aa87-cc52827fae41']",Ontologies and representation spaces for sketch map interpretation,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2017
30,"In this paper, the Spectral Amplitude Coding-Optical Code Division Multiple Access (SAC-OCDMA) system performance is investigated both in Free Space Optics (FSO) and Optical Fiber Systems (OFS) scenarios focusing on different types of codes. The codes having low cross correlation such as Random Diagonal (RD) and Khazani-Syed (KS), and zero cross correlation such as Zero Cross Correlation (ZCC) and Multi-Diagonal (MD) are used. In the FSO scenario, moderate turbulence and hazy weather conditions are considered. In the OFS scenario, nonlinear effects, attenuation, and dispersion are taken into consideration. Also, the performance of various codes is evaluated under different rain attenuation conditions. The simulation results show that the SAC-OCDMA codes performance is media-dependent. The ZCC codes give better performance than low cross correlation codes in both FSO and OFS scenarios. The MD code gives the best code performance in both scenarios with the ZCC code following. The RD code provides better performance than the KS code in the OFS scenario. However, in the FSO scenario, the KS code performs better than the RD code under the turbulence effect. Furthermore, the MD code performance under different bit rates is investigated to support tri-play services. Its security performance is also investigated.","['Salwa Mostafa', 'Abd El-Naser A.

31,"This paper presents a new solver for the exactly one-in-a-set Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP). In the GTSP, we are given as input a complete directed graph with edge weights, along with a partition of the vertices into disjoint sets. The objective is to find a cycle (or tour) in the graph that visits each set exactly once and has minimum length. In this paper we present an effective algorithm for the GTSP based on adaptive large neighborhood search. The algorithm operates by repeatedly removing from, and inserting vertices in, the tour. We propose a general insertion mechanism that contains as special cases the well-known nearest, farthest and random insertion mechanisms. We provide extensive benchmarking results for our solver in comparison to the state-of-the-art on a wide range of existing and new problem libraries. We show that on the GTSPLIB library, the proposed algorithm is competitive with the best known algorithms. On several other libraries, we show that given the same amount of time, the proposed solver finds higher quality solutions than existing approaches, particularly on harder instances that are non-metric and/or whose sets are not clustered.","['Stephen L.

This problem has been studied in several works, with O(log m)-approximations known in the special cases when either costs or probabilities are uniform.

We also consider a substantial generalization, the adaptive traveling salesman problem.

35,"Recent experiments demonstrated that atherosclerosis is a Th1 dominant autoimmune condition, whereas Th2 cells are rarely detected within the atherosclerotic lesions. Several studies have indicated that Th2 type cytokines could be effective in the reduction and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. Therefore, the modulation of the adaptive immune response by shifting immune responses toward Th2 cells by a novel vaccine could represent a promising approach to prevent from progression and thromboembolic events in coronary artery disease. In the present study, an in silico approach was applied to design a novel multi-epitope vaccine to elicit a desirable immune response against atherosclerosis. Six novel IL-4 inducing epitopes were selected from HSP60 and calreticulin proteins. To enhance epitope presentation, IL-4 inducing epitopes were linked together by AAY and HEYGAEALERAG linkers. In addition, helper epitopes selected from Tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFrC) were applied to induce CD4+ helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses. Moreover, cholera toxin B (CTB) was employed as an adjuvant. A multi-epitope construct was designed based on predicted epitopes which was 320 residues in length. Then, the physico-chemical properties, secondary and tertiary structures, stability, intrinsic protein disorder, solubility and allergenicity of this chimeric protein were analyzed using bioinformatics tools and servers. Based on bioinformatics analysis, a soluble, and non-allergic protein with 35.405 kDa molecular weight was designed. Expasy ProtParam classified this chimeric protein as a stable protein. In addition, predicted epitopes in the chimeric vaccine indicated strong potential to induce B-cell mediated immune response and shift immune responses toward protective Th2 immune response. Various in silico analyses indicate that this vaccine is a qualified candidate for improvement of atherosclerosis by inducing immune responses toward T helper 2.","['Ahmad Karkhah', 'Mahdiye Saadi', 'Hamid Reza Nouri']",32199553-4956-43e6-bc95-4af7d5e5735b,0,"['0fc5bbc9-7026-407d-8275-50003fbdb98b', '157902be-a026-49fc-837b-0df0f922003f', '37a2ea7d-e7b6-49e4-ba6f-8262064d1e9d', '6608eb9a-acb2-481c-bfeb-5b275f47d03b', '7e61090d-7139-4092-a33f-fda1dcc3f4a1', '9815a12d-ef19-4df6-bf25-ab1e5f14f3eb', '9ca88d22-46f7-4635-b576-e76713d5e597', '9f8cf9de-face-4287-896e-3d2fa107ae29', 'e0e36390-0802-4b0b-bcde-d35d56cc5252', 'f1c409ac-c183-40df-b3a7-90b05984174c']",In silico analyses of heat shock protein 60 and calreticulin to designing a novel vaccine shifting immune response toward T helper 2 in atherosclerosis,Computational Biology and Chemistry,2017

Moreover, scalability and location information availability under various circumstances are also substantial factors in designing an effective location service paradigm. By and large, utilizing centralized or distributed location servers responsible for storing the location information of all, or a subset of participant mobile devices, is a method employed in a significant portion of location service schemes. However, from the fairness point of view, it is more suitable to employ a location service scheme that treats participant nodes fairly, without mandating an unlucky subset to undertake the responsibility of serving as location server(s). In this work, we propose a scalable and fully decentralized location service scheme (PETAL) in which the burden of location update and inquiry tasks is almost evenly distributed among the nodes, resulting in an improvement in resilience against individual node failures. PETAL does not require hashing which results in more complexity, it is resilient against swarm mobility pattern, it requires minimal periodic location update messages when nodes do not move, and finally it does not require too many parameter configurations on all nodes. Our simulation results reveal that PETAL performs efficiently, particularly in environments densely populated by wireless devices.","['Amir Rahimzadeh Ilkhechi', 'Ibrahim Korpeoglu', 'Uğur Güdükbay', 'Özgür Ulusoy']",86798e31-2925-4d72-ad9b-13b4935504f8,0,"['03c66e22-1f88-4372-bd57-8b63d0ac04ad', '1545dfd3-2c25-4ff1-b43c-df4a2a501d06', '19ccc62c-90e1-4029-ab9d-b3cf0dca8076', '230f7c02-d35c-47e0-8873-ad71095f3304', '3578e277-423b-4d5f-b103-dded086ebb9d', '488d252d-1624-42e7-a46a-dee9ab156da3', '4b9e7069-fa06-4c45-8b52-eddfe92f6674', '4d1a9a80-878d-4b64-a9c7-5b60b7d11382', '56b47e7d-dd4b-4970-9071-63bfaf89607c', '661f9b20-f251-4d23-939f-8666bd1866a0', '6723c843-fad9-4ed6-8ea5-6e766d0283e0', '7a7821c7-1b3c-4b18-8e00-9639849d9e9f', '8a436bdd-c63a-4437-9b27-0ab6735663a1', '9cd94744-856d-49cf-9c6e-e679126dbe72', 'a30ab6bf-e94d-44b3-aed6-3ef8f781c36e', 'a4f3486a-8403-480f-a28c-8d14a3c82a08', 'a6742627-6c64-450d-8341-e9e61751c23e', 'a7bc1916-3fa9-46cc-83b2-abe2d514b987', 'a7e15cfa-8491-4c30-9447-be16b7d017e1', 'cd069636-9b89-495c-a4c7-dadc0eae0c8b', 'd5c3208c-cdac-455b-9a8d-0b9d261fbf1e', 'e3af190a-754d-415d-a32d-f1d9999c599f', 'e4ee2d81-7629-4445-b4f3-55ef57bd42fd', 'efffc1b7-ead8-420e-9fe9-633e0b26b232', 'f1f81c0b-96a1-4c75-bb26-d180e833a858', 'f2c014f9-e81c-4d12-a9b3-b8f88cc30b4a']",PETAL: A fully distributed location service for wireless ad hoc networks,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017

39,"A 12-bit 200MS/s pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) is proposed in this paper. An innovative timing control technology is applied to the SHA in order to eliminate its nonlinear kickback, while the SHA eliminates bandwidth and timing mismatches between the input networks of the flash (sub-ADC) and of the multiplying DAC (MDAC) in the first stage, to improve the analog input bandwidth and to meet the requirements of a high-IF sampling ADC. A novel full complementary op-amp is utilized to reduce the overall power consumption of the ADC, which makes the power consumption of the SHA and of the first stage less than 20 mW. A new fully differential reference buffer and a clock receiver with duty-cycle stabilizer (DCS) are applied in the prototype ADC. The jitter of the clock receiver is less than 150 fs to avoid the SNR degradation. The ADC is implemented in 0.18 µm CMOS process and consumes 91 mW from a 1.8 V supply. The ADC achieves an SNDR of 66.10 dB and an SFDR of 84.45 dB with 10 MHz input signal, while maintaining an SNDR >65 dB and SFDR >80 dB up in the entire Nyquist band. Its input signal frequency is up to 500 MHz.","['Maliang Liu', 'Kaixiong Lian', 'Yingzhou Huang', 'Rui Ma', 'Zhangming Zhu']",f524f5d3-e1eb-4867-9eec-ce21e9470a40,0,"['1e17377c-69a0-4936-98a2-f105bc221d45', '35cb1fd9-b31d-440c-b816-9e38e4d207a2', '3bb323c4-ad79-4e4e-a3b0-f1c19715d4fc', '5852e042-6428-48c7-a076-2d9e9c08e5c0', '5d1c5356-7af2-4a1a-9cdb-ef638ffa8a48', '9e90b59a-4f03-437d-8a5e-894def7f60b0', 'ce377e09-f4bf-4d1c-9774-0c20bc558257', 'ddfef57f-3703-4f4b-b1f7-5db49a18e9d6']",A 12-bit 200MS/s pipeline ADC with 91 mW power and 66 dB SNDR,Microelectronics Journal,2017

41,"Patients with total locked-in syndrome are conscious; however, they cannot express themselves because most of their voluntary muscles are paralyzed, and many of these patients have lost their eyesight. To improve the quality of life of these patients, there is an increasing need for communication-supporting technologies that leverage the remaining senses of the patient along with physiological signals. The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is an electro-physiologic response to auditory stimulation that is amplitude-modulated by a specific frequency. By leveraging the phenomenon whereby ASSR is modulated by mind concentration, a brain–computer interface paradigm was proposed to classify the selective attention of the patient. In this paper, we propose an auditory stimulation method to minimize auditory stress by replacing the monotone carrier with familiar music and natural sounds for an ergonomic system. Piano and violin instrumentals were employed in the music sessions; the sounds of water streaming and cicadas singing were used in the natural sound sessions. Six healthy subjects participated in the experiment. Electroencephalograms were recorded using four electrodes (Cz, Oz, T7 and T8). Seven sessions were performed using different stimuli. The spectral power at 38 and 42 Hz and their ratio for each electrode were extracted as features. Linear discriminant analysis was utilized to classify the selections for each subject. In offline analysis, the average classification accuracies with a modulation index of 1.0 were 89.67% and 87.67% using music and natural sounds, respectively. In online experiments, the average classification accuracies were 88.3% and 80.0% using music and natural sounds, respectively. Using the proposed method, we obtained significantly higher user-acceptance scores, while maintaining a high average classification accuracy.","['Jeong Heo', 'Hyun Jae Baek', 'Seunghyeok Hong', 'Min Hye Chang', 'Jeong Su Lee', 'Kwang Suk Park']",9dd43681-48de-4ba1-bf23-90af155c7e21,0,"['690a2d2d-d2e7-4482-984a-927333ea6b66', '7a6bfdb2-3c41-4a29-bc37-4b53ee120c59', 'a153e318-b9a7-4550-98ad-bb17ec46ec08', 'd00498d6-8ca2-4aca-bfcb-d6abedfc53d6', 'f7a37f64-4622-4f5c-a624-a3380021850a']",Music and natural sounds in an auditory steady-state response based brain–computer interface to increase user acceptance,Computers in Biology and Medicine,2017
42,"The convergence analysis of the Extrapolated Diffusion (EDF) method was developed in Karagiorgos and Missirlis (2008) and Markomanolis and Missirlis (2010) for 2D weighted torus and mesh graphs, respectively using the set N1(i)N1(i) of the nearest neighbors of a source node ii in the graph. In the present work we propose a Diffusion scheme which employs the set N1(i)∪N2(i)N1(i)∪N2(i), where N2(i)N2(i) denotes the set of the nearest neighbors of a source node ii with path length two in an attempt to improve the performance of the new method. We develop the convergence analysis of the new EDF method by considering two subsets of N2(i)N2(i) for 2D weighted torus graphs. In particular, we study five different communication routes for computing the load of each node ii in the torus graph and for each route we find closed form formulae for the optimum values of the edge weights, the extrapolation parameters and the convergence factor of the new EDF scheme. A comparison of the convergence factors of all these EDF schemes reveals a 60% improvement in the performance using the cross communication route compared to the conventional EDF method, a fact which is shown theoretically and experimentally.","['Katerina A.

44,"Data compression plays a pivotal role in improving system performance and reducing energy consumption, because it increases the logical effective capacity of a compressed memory system without physically increasing the memory size. However, data compression techniques incur some cost, such as non-negligible compression and decompression overhead. This overhead becomes more severe if compression is used in the cache. In this article, we aim to minimize the read-hit decompression penalty in compressed Last-Level Caches (LLCs) by speculatively decompressing frequently used cachelines. To this end, we propose a Hot-cacheline Prediction and Early decompression (HoPE) mechanism that consists of three synergistic techniques: Hot-cacheline Prediction (HP), Early Decompression (ED), and Hit-history-based Insertion (HBI). HP and HBI efficiently identify the hot compressed cachelines, while ED selectively decompresses hot cachelines, based on their size information. Unlike previous approaches, the HoPE framework considers the performance balance/tradeoff between the increased effective cache capacity and the decompression penalty. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HoPE mechanism, we run extensive simulations on memory traces obtained from multi-threaded benchmarks running on a full-system simulation framework. We observe significant performance improvements over compressed cache schemes employing the conventional Least-Recently Used (LRU) replacement policy, the Dynamic Re-Reference Interval Prediction (DRRIP) scheme, and the Effective Capacity Maximizer (ECM) compressed cache management mechanism. Specifically, HoPE exhibits system performance improvements of approximately 11%, on average, over LRU, 8% over DRRIP, and 7% over ECM by reducing the read-hit decompression penalty by around 65%, over a wide range of applications.","['Jaehyun Park', 'Seungcheol Baek', 'Hyung Gyu Lee', 'Chrysostomos Nicopoulos', 'Vinson Young', 'Jung-Hee Lee', 'Jongman Kim']",ccd65027-4dfd-4963-a0d4-f258db7727f2,0,"['11e0ab3e-e43e-4a61-bb60-aea06e67fcdd', '14954e39-c54c-43cc-8bff-f4a0a575fdf1', '193912ea-e0c3-419b-8fab-c4f4bd1e5e4f', '1fc7bd09-bd5e-4ee7-b2a7-bb00d09254bc', '266b77f7-3154-469c-9eed-2e40d0a62b44', '3faab9f3-dc2d-4fdc-ae38-8199b5d422e4', '5394d502-c504-45ab-b691-307206182f20', '53a871b9-be8c-4011-838c-5c6e8f5f134a', '563c422b-dab6-4a2c-9175-32d91a0d7c0a', '587e6784-87ba-4b41-8895-b3b29c7ff95d', '5a631c64-e60c-43bd-abbd-a3831890a658', '5ffa6899-57db-4179-a41b-b5d3f4c7ca9a', '8012e407-ad3c-4319-b550-50a73533b17b', '82ccd671-d52f-4e9d-9f1e-f5a95c225188', '86d32c9f-2176-4e08-83de-d5b82f30fe71', '895f4e1e-1147-4c94-b4f3-a54f9313e40c', '95e4396e-3118-4ead-bba2-8c5e29b6b818', 'a75684fb-3cf5-426a-bbc6-3b4b64bef488', 'adc3d6b5-1829-4596-bb48-e6a4ae0f83cd', 'da43feb2-93cd-44f7-a7e8-a74dffab0c65', 'da92facb-9840-4cbc-9077-67f5ceb78713', 'e0206e7e-e58b-477f-b0ce-b0bfe53fb865', 'e52bccf1-85ce-4636-8cbc-6652e0cdf900', 'ff5c0fca-9f72-43fc-9922-da1f3bd565a2']",HoPE: Hot-Cacheline Prediction for Dynamic Early Decompression in Compressed LLCs,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,2017
45,"Detecting communities in complex networks is one of the most important issues considered when analyzing these kinds of networks. A majority of studies in the field of community detection tend to detect communities through analyzing linkages of the networks. What this paper aims to achieve is to reach to a trade-off between similarity of nodes' attributes and density of connections in finding communities of social networks with node attributes. Since the community detection problem can be modeled as a seriously non-linear discrete optimization problem, we have hereby proposed a multi-objective discrete Biogeography Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm to find communities in social networks with node attributes. This algorithm uses the Pareto-based approach for community detection. Also, we introduced a new metric, SimAtt, to measure the similarity of node attributes in a community of a network and used it along with Modularity, which considers the linkage structure of a network to detect communities, as the two objective functions of the proposed method to be maximized. In the proposed method, a two phase sorting strategy is introduced which uses the non-dominated sorting and Crowding-distance to sort the generated solution of a population in each iteration. Moreover, this paper introduces a method for mutation probability approximation and uses a chaotic mechanism to dynamically tune the mutation probability in each iteration. Additionally, two novel strategies are introduced for mutation in unweighted and weighted networks. Since the final output of the proposed method is a set of non-dominated (Pareto-optimal) solutions, a metric named alpha_SAM is proposed to determine the best compromise solution among these non-dominated ones. Quantitative evaluations based on extensive experiments on 14 real-life data sets reveals that the method presented in this study achieves favorable results which are quite superior to other relevant algorithms in the literature.","['Ali Reihanian', 'Mohammad-Reza Feizi-Derakhshi', 'Hadi S.

46,"In this paper, Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs) are exploited to model and evaluate the power consumption and performance of virtualized servers in cloud computing. The proposed SAN models the physical servers in three different power consumption and provisioning delay modes, switching the status of the servers according to the workload of the corresponding cluster if required. The Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) technique is considered in the proposed model for dynamically controlling the supply voltage and clock frequency of CPUs. Thus, Virtual Machines (VMs) on top a physical server can be divided into several power consumption and processing speed groups. According to the workload of the system and the number of waiting requests, the proposed SAN decides to scale up or down the VMs, so it helps the overall system to save power when it still preserves satisfiable performance. After modeling the servers and VMs using SAN formalism, some performance related measures together with the power consumption metric are defined on the proposed model. The results obtained by solving the proposed SAN model configured with real data show the prominence of the proposed model in comparison with some baselines and previously proposed models.","['Reza Entezari-Maleki', 'Leonel Sousa', 'Ali Movaghar']",af98c2aa-4b06-42a3-a5c1-2cd88fd51c35,0,"['0b988ebc-34be-4a3e-947d-064d3dba9a20', '0bdbd4aa-c545-483f-98b4-478c437150b4', '0ece7c62-1aa1-4d80-abd4-a3eb3097f0f3', '138c1555-20a3-47eb-8bf9-0e82b916fe55', '1ae994d8-ddfa-4f61-bf18-8ea62039101f', '21cca4fe-e24e-4ff3-9488-9d8b8705c089', '2d062b46-eb3f-464d-b193-a69972372195', '2e945a95-38b2-4ab6-93bc-9d12a78f3c1e', '4281f15c-2b1a-48eb-9b31-56de3c1732aa', '43f1c179-5c94-41b9-ac6b-18ff2fcc4697', '55c281fd-3fe4-4e05-9cb9-5b1f4fbc42d0', '6205674f-2f4c-440d-8d73-d763026820a6', '64833c71-82a2-422f-a72c-e2c305eb51ef', '75cae0be-147c-4cf5-803c-758aa3b31ab4', '88da74d7-39f1-4271-b0d2-02fc9650e936', '8c7e8efe-f018-4f0c-92b9-bed3d62e0a92', '9d2dfa99-29f3-49ee-9d9c-650e7346b151', 'a33c51ac-8b89-4e22-b4f0-1c7fe0cea411', 'ac0ec5b8-67b6-4247-81ba-407af5c4ea1b', 'b7bbead5-6e8b-42fe-a0bc-0a70b692ad1a', 'b8aa1917-dae5-4467-b5c6-badfaab6765a', 'd76ebf64-68e2-4059-85ed-e93ee84597a0', 'e9703f3b-6ff7-406c-80ec-bf625dedbb23', 'edd9afef-deb1-4b28-9fce-4a1952528f4d', 'f90732fc-0f25-4c01-9bdc-83f3c05afdc7']",Performance and power modeling and evaluation of virtualized servers in IaaS clouds,Information Sciences,2017
47,"Continuous-time scheduling models for multiproduct pipelines typically view the contents of a pipeline as a set of batches. It facilitates tracking batch coordinates but prevents rigorously enforcing forbidden product sequences when dealing with intermediate dual-purpose nodes. Such models require the initial characterization of the pipeline and total number of batches as inputs, decisions that can be non-trivial. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for straight pipelines with a single tuning parameter, the number of event points in the grid. It is derived from Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) followed by a convex hull reformulation. Compared to a product-centric formulation based on the Resource-Task Network (RTN), it is much simpler, smaller in size and can be up to two orders of magnitude faster. Comparison to its batch-centric counterpart is not as favorable, the highlight being an 8% improvement in makespan for a benchmark problem.","['Pedro M.

48,"In conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA), measures are classified as either input or output. However, in some real cases there are variables which act as both input and output and are known as flexible measures. Most of the previous suggested models for determining the status of flexible measures are oriented. One important issue of these models is that unlike standard DEA, even under constant returns to scale the input- and output-oriented model may produce different efficiency scores. Also, can be expected a flexible measure is selected as an input variable in one model but an output variable in the other model. In addition, in all of the previous studies did not point to variable returns to scale (VRS), but the VRS assumption is prevailed on many real applications. To deal with these issues, this study proposes a new non-oriented model that not only selects the status of each flexible measure as an input or output but also determines returns to scale status. Then, the aggregate model and an extension with the negative data related to the proposed approach are presented.","['Gh. Tohidi', 'F.

50,"This paper proposes an algorithm of building keypoint matches on multimodal images by combining a bootstrap process and global information. The correct ratio of keypoint matches built with descriptors is typically very low on multimodal images of large spectral difference. To identify correct matches, global information is utilized for evaluating keypoint matches and a bootstrap technique is employed to reduce the computational cost. A keypoint match determines a transformation    $T$    and a similarity metric between the reference and the transformed test image by    $T$   . The similarity metric encodes global information over entire images, and hence, a higher similarity indicates the match can bring more image content into alignment, implying it tends to be correct. Unfortunately, exhausting triplets/quadruples of matches for affine/projective transformation is computationally intractable, when the number of keypoints is large. To reduce the computational cost, a bootstrap technique is employed that starts from single matches for a translation and rotation model, and goes increasingly to quadruples of four matches for a projective model. The global information screens for “good” matches at each stage and the bootstrap strategy makes the screening process computationally feasible. Experimental results show that the proposed method can establish reliable keypoint matches on challenging multimodal images of strong multimodality.","['Yong Li', 'Hongbin Jin', 'Jiatao Wu', 'Jie Liu']",97024b85-06c0-4524-a3af-662d24923672,0,"['0047b2cf-bd19-4f8a-979e-ef5cc5b4a43f', '0829abc2-cc58-4cc9-9218-d8ae30c6a216', '1543c41f-1e50-4e51-84ef-fe464aae99ef', '16191227-75f9-44ec-85d1-7bf21b127382', '18947b09-1369-4ef6-8a99-426a25a7ed05', '26f9b0d4-4834-41f6-ad00-13b61d437419', '2e71fa79-72e8-41ac-9b84-ea04720d7255', '3a59db13-9b83-4c2d-ada4-d72fb7e37026', '3b299ab9-de97-4f0f-99ff-f81d5bf92423', '3d959749-7194-46ec-980c-5f9c62e0c54c', '483611d9-ffc4-468b-9ebe-02662a8061c4', '4d58b588-8985-49e5-9c98-a64e4e4b8c42', '50252efa-a843-4cc6-a591-22f527ee3d6c', '529754fe-76a7-475c-8a96-aab22ed34209', '592e4083-7c59-4820-a364-fc635b9494d4', '5fbdc876-7f2a-40fe-8658-e87e23883326', '618fe16d-b36e-4a09-9172-6d5906ee2a21', '65af8909-9be3-4282-a9d0-d6d9d21d8bd1', '6b3a766f-dcfc-4f9d-9540-2041440a6ccc', '815867c2-e1dc-4f2b-ab95-6669f3fc9043', '897b0d64-16f8-4abe-b3a6-19cad2753449', '97571808-28e5-400a-8793-5ca824c4fc6e', 'a118fe67-3e35-4d5e-af75-e47291bf3afc', 'a251abc4-87bf-48a0-ba35-fabb8182a183', 'aaeeaad5-3f38-47fb-af44-fe2dfa477140', 'abb7ba4b-3973-4c07-94fc-8602fd52aed6', 'ad6cebdf-e58f-4be5-8c0a-74b48fbd43ce', 'b156dfb5-1b83-4f78-9c7b-29d6fb55306d', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'd81479a0-66a2-4080-bb0a-27894bd05a75', 'e135be42-c036-4676-b2fa-0941c6e99769', 'e84c646d-3dba-4685-92a2-29aebfad9b46', 'ebfca554-7a3c-4597-954b-07336a2e3030']",Establishing Keypoint Matches on Multimodal Images With Bootstrap Strategy and Global Information,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
51,"Abstract  Introduction  Proper cooperation between patient and dentist is of great help to make a good oral impression. However, patients are frequently confused when information is given through traditional verbal description. The present study compared the effectiveness of the multimedia information delivery ways with the traditional verbal manner on patients' understanding level in oral impression taking.  Methods  The recruited 191 participating patients were randomly assigned to the control group (the verbal group) and two intervention groups (the video group and the picture group) according to the information delivery manner. After intervention, the patients' understanding degree was measured by questionnaire and performance evaluation of behavior feedback on the provided information quantitatively. Also, patients' self-assessment of satisfaction was interviewed by telephone. All data was analyzed by SPSS 14.0 software, and p≤0.05 was set as significant difference in advance.  Results  One-Way ANOVA and Chi-square showed there were no statistically significant differences in the mean age, gender composition, and educational level among the three groups (P>0.05). In both questionnaire assessment and performance evaluation, One-Way ANOVA followed by LSD indicate that the video group gained a higher score than the verbal group or the picture group (P 0.05). Higher percentage of satisfaction was reported by patients in the two multimedia groups than that in the control group.  Discussion  Oral impression taking is a consecutive process that requires action cooperation between dentists and patients simultaneously. This particularity makes it more suitable for multimedia delivery. The delivery of tailored information using multimedia in this study was favored by most patients and could improve the degree of patient understanding of the oral impression taking procedures.","['Dandan Pei', 'Beilei Liang', 'Wenzhi Du', 'Peng Wang', 'Jie Liu', 'Min He', 'Yi Lu']",fcfb6646-be70-4dd4-a92d-03c938ba0108,0,"['4dced8f0-3bf5-4c1b-83ba-7f903380978c', '73eae186-a535-456a-bb02-1d4a225e6fa5', '871ea96e-6b36-43c9-99b6-8402b6aa09f5']",Multimedia patient education to assist oral impression taking during dental treatment: A pilot study,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2017

54,"Object class segmentation is a computer vision task which requires labeling each pixel of an image with the class of the object it belongs to. Deep convolutional neural networks (DNN) are able to learn and take advantage of local spatial correlations required for this task. They are, however, restricted by their small, fixed-sized filters, which limits their ability to learn long-range dependencies. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), on the other hand, do not suffer from this restriction. Their iterative interpretation allows them to model long-range dependencies by propagating activity. This property is especially useful when labeling video sequences, where both spatial and temporal long-range dependencies occur.

56,"As various biomedical electronic devices supported by different network protocols are springing up in our living space, many development and researches focus on building a digital biomedical system by using modern techniques. To realize such a theme, the system architecture supporting biomedical services in a health care center should include a broker built in a single computer or an embedded system to coordinate various devices. The main challenge is how the future-proof biomedical devices can be easily integrated into the system. In this paper, we propose a practical skeleton to build a personal biomedical sensing system featuring integrability, extendibility and flexibility. The construction guidelines in the skeleton can ease the development and maintenance for developers. A practically realized case study validates the effectiveness of the proposed skeleton. Besides, the proposed scheduling scheme can stabilize the biomedical sensor messages. The period of sending messages could be changeable based on the shortest processing time rule. From the experimental results, the proposed scheme can reduce the waiting time and stabilize messages from biomedical sensors. The central control broker is very essential to handle the main process in the proposed scheme and to control the scheduling scheme of four biomedical sensors used in this research.","['Chi-Feng Chen', 'Jenq-Shiou Leu', 'Reza Syahroel Ghufran', 'Setya Widyawan Prakosa']",e99e100e-d5b0-42c4-b7e3-6de1dfd4c82f,0,"['1f107e2b-c055-417a-9a6b-b3f745dca0a5', '1fa9e80b-9ea4-40b0-82da-e078ec1ffee7', '239a053d-b927-4a2c-8588-3d6c13b2fc84', '23eba49f-8646-4440-8e22-0a9294faab5b', '7254bef7-ccb8-45af-a6b6-4ff1a4e1da1e', 'a5d3ec89-d670-43dd-9a6c-bf7d776cb57e', 'b5199e07-622d-4ad9-bb11-81bee63e8d4c', 'e4698ed4-0750-4b0c-a71d-e32924219579']",Message Scheduling for Personal Biomedical Sensing System in a Health Care Center,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
57,"Local search (LS) is an essential module of most hybrid meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithms which are a major approach aimed to solve efficiently multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems. Furthermore, LS is specifically useful in many real-world applications where there is a need only to improve a current state of a system locally with limited computational budget and/or relying on computationally expensive process simulators. In these contexts, this paper proposes a new neighborhood-based iterative LS method, relying on first derivatives approximation and linear programming (LP), aiming to steer the search along any desired direction in the objectives space. The paper also leverages the directed local search (DS) method to constrained MOO problems. These methods are applied to the bi-objective (cost versus life cycle assessment-based environmental impact) optimization of drinking water production plants. The results obtained show that the proposed method constitutes a promising local search method which clearly outperforms the directed search approach.","['Florin Capitanescu', 'Antonino Marvuglia', 'Enrico Benetto', 'Aras Ahmadi', 'Ligia Tiruta-Barna']",99d476b0-e4d7-477a-bd7c-ee87b3be9125,0,"['028cfedc-d41d-4830-bb4d-337415cd2472', '029a8763-f7f0-4adf-b03c-4c2a0c9ced15', '0d869da9-8601-4c65-8b76-186bd247c97e', '0e6edb90-df2d-4aff-8fbf-4fc83c7dd16b', '1a485b29-082d-41ec-a944-6de72914c40d', '2039bab2-7f86-4925-89f1-055085c7b2c3', '204dae48-3299-4c7c-9f39-2d7be0d0c0a9', '247ecd81-83cc-4ff5-8430-089788603f36', '27e053dd-72c9-49fe-8831-b31dc8f293ac', '2fa4bdf3-82d5-45d5-b645-08abbecc7e7a', '303d98de-36c6-4fc8-9ea9-dd0738957b34', '3c2dd6af-0684-4fe6-b3a3-e06a245fbbe2', '47bb3bb2-9e64-49a2-96a0-aa346275e7c1', '59d5a581-b744-47aa-8f82-c845fd9fc66c', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '6e21ddb1-4039-4ba2-9b64-a641aeb9039e', '7c9f6c1e-51a7-4bb4-b300-c800b7d0cf7d', '7e155c0f-f2d2-4d46-b6dd-3cf686cc9e29', '89ed0f1b-cde5-45e9-bbf2-9ae3c2cfde6a', '8aad37e1-969d-4620-8cbb-50b7f3c5e587', '8b891a0e-c54c-4dcc-872c-bc172c222ab6', '9462a760-4e27-436a-9598-c6fd1f808597', '9c1e42ba-6b67-477b-b588-a49e46af90b9', '9c3a2cb2-32c6-461d-8cf9-e7752d21ee67', '9f7f87c1-326d-42ea-9cc3-77ceae210259', 'b85e4e95-be84-4745-868c-bcb3de6b9e2a', 'bea9a527-4134-4ce2-a07d-ab162172c488', 'ca199ea9-d013-4a3d-801b-e41b602f4d70', 'cfb4099e-1848-48dd-b38a-63a59b5c7c9e', 'd5087684-0368-4362-88d4-910e3c107c68', 'd73cfeb7-dc88-431d-a57e-2b70f0990773', 'e3347df2-6f3c-4bbb-a139-6b29eef4d7dc', 'f6e6b2cb-265d-4f03-a160-866dd0d6c4bf', 'f8e0d422-6f2a-4059-8c67-44599b0e6039']",Linear programming-based directed local search for expensive multi-objective optimization problems: Application to drinking water production plants,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
58,"Energy consumption is one of the main challenges in wireless sensor networks. Additionally, in target tracking algorithms, it is expected to have a longer lifetime for the network, when a better prediction algorithm is employed, since it activates fewer sensors in the network. Most target tracking methods activate a large number of nodes in sensor networks. This paper proposes a new tracking algorithm reducing the number of active nodes in both positioning and tracking by predicting the target deployment area in the next time interval according to some factors including the previous location of the target, the current speed and acceleration of the target without reducing the tracking performance. The proposed algorithm activates the sensor nodes available in the target area by predicting the target position in the next time interval. The problem of target loss is also considered and solved in the proposed tracking algorithm. In the numerical analysis, the number of nodes involved in target tracking, energy consumption and the network lifetime are compared with other tracking algorithms to show superiority of the proposed algorithm.","['Ali Shokouhi Rostami', 'Farahnaz Mohanna', 'Hengameh Keshavarz']",441e33e1-bd9f-4fb7-93db-4a494caec886,0,"['03b1803d-748d-42dc-a1e8-f7fc849a9660', '07c739b0-1d29-4e7d-ab45-2456f77fe212', '0a538d11-5a4c-44bc-86bc-06597ee7bed4', '1470fadf-0113-412b-9560-6db925d71a79', '6cb4bbce-7dcb-4915-89fb-36203b60c745', '6dde64b8-6121-4edb-95cb-6ecd515e677b', '79f4a99d-ea1f-40ac-84be-0b1df513b225', '7ff8f96f-a657-424c-a90f-fe17c40bdf07', '9ed5c667-86bd-441c-9fba-f66b3716f893', 'b1f941ec-3c28-4963-adcb-ff2c1bdd1228', 'e8ffa661-c577-45d7-ab2d-39297c13bed3', 'f95ddbf4-6e47-49d5-bd77-eb369902c0e9']",A Novel Energy-Aware Target Tracking Method by Reducing Active Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
59,"This work proposes the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) in tracing and recognizing the pericardium contour of the human heart using Computed Tomography (CT) images. We assume that each slice of the pericardium can be modelled by an ellipse, the parameters of which need to be optimally determined. An optimal ellipse would be one that closely follows the pericardium contour and, consequently, separates appropriately the epicardial and mediastinal fats of the human heart. Tracing and automatically identifying the pericardium contour aids in medical diagnosis. Usually, this process is done manually or not done at all due to the effort required. Besides, detecting the pericardium may improve previously proposed automated methodologies that separate the two types of fat associated to the human heart. Quantification of these fats provides important health risk marker information, as they are associated with the development of certain cardiovascular pathologies. Finally, we conclude that GA offers satisfiable solutions in a feasible amount of processing time.","['É.O. Rodrigues', 'L.O. Rodrigues', 'L.S.N.

The goal is to indirectly estimate the connectivity between the cortical areas, through the quantification of the coupling strength between the corresponding EEG signals, in order to find a possible matching with the disease’s progression. Method: PDI is first defined and tested on simulated interacting dynamic systems. PDI is then applied to real EEG recorded from 8 amnestic MCI subjects and 7 AD patients, who were longitudinally evaluated at time T0 and 3 months later (time T1).

The crystal is fixed in the space and cannot be convected in most of the previous studies, instead the supercooled melt flows around the crystal, which is hard to be realized in the real world experimental setting. Applying advection to the crystal equation, we have problems such as deformation of crystal shape and ambiguity of the crystal orientation for the anisotropy. To resolve these difficulties, we present a phase-field method by using a moving overset grid for the dendritic growth in a cavity flow.

62,"Limited by visual percepts elicited by existing visual prosthesis, it’s necessary to enhance its functionality to fulfill some challenging tasks for the blind such as obstacle avoidance. This paper argues that spiking neural networks (SNN) are effective techniques for object recognition and introduces for the first time a SNN model for obstacle recognition to assist blind people wearing prosthetic vision devices by modelling and classifying spatio-temporal (ST) video data. The proposed methodology is based on a novel spiking neural network architecture, called NeuCube as a general framework for video data modelling in simulated prosthetic vision. As an integrated environment including spiking trains encoding, input variable mapping, unsupervised reservoir training and supervised classifier training, the NeuCube consists of a spiking neural network reservoir (SNNr) and a dynamic evolving spiking neural network classifier (deSNN). First, input data is captured by visual prosthesis, then ST feature extraction is utilized in the low-resolution prosthetic vision generated by prostheses. Finally such ST features are fed to the NeuCube to output classification result of obstacle analysis for an early warning system to be activated. Experiments on collected video data and comparison with other computational intelligence methods indicate promising results. This makes it possible to directly utilize available neuromorphic hardware chips, embedded in visual prostheses, to enhance significantly their functionality. The proposed NeuCube-based obstacle avoidance methodology provides useful guidance to the blind, thus offering a significant improvement of current prostheses and potentially benefiting future prosthesis wearers.","['Chenjie Ge', 'Nikola Kasabov', 'Zhi Liu', 'Jie Yang']",e6463683-6e71-4b5c-90ea-2b89da132a24,0,"['0f27e714-8cbf-4289-9c89-b54bd2d236fa', '153c5014-dc7a-44a8-a93f-5cd27f1193df', '17313553-7742-4ff1-9051-9596c6914e53', '264cf9a7-a1a6-441c-8d3a-ce5badd4f7fe', '28cc2669-38ed-40ae-8174-2897bc4a7a87', '5cec8749-ec04-4ff6-aa6c-c183d6fd09a7', '6383b843-4f43-41cc-a80c-c4f5cae37bb0', '64da2748-6705-4ea8-be42-9e3337c298e8', '6cbcb9df-b871-424c-9518-73606819b52b', '8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498', '84596c71-8827-42fd-8fba-ab8afedadc16', '8aa684de-c8ce-430c-bb36-7b1541c69d9f', 'b0dbd57d-b349-4c31-a5b7-042c5654e1e3', 'd080bd80-cc20-46a3-90fc-8f694bf51bf8', 'd3569a19-f7c2-4a91-8f1f-ef9e92b9ba94', 'd6c7fbd4-f0c8-47fc-8344-f525cf79f998', 'e0b0b73b-b8e9-4df7-8687-d2771067f35c', 'e0b95bc1-e105-4b51-9294-68771c4598fd', 'e418e05f-6bf6-43d1-8e1f-bb85fef06b5e']",A spiking neural network model for obstacle avoidance in simulated prosthetic vision,Information Sciences,2017
63,"Automatic image annotation is a challenging research problem that includes a large number of tags and various features. Traditional shallow machine learning algorithms lack generalization performance when dealing with complex classification problems. Automatic image annotation based on a stacked auto-encoder (SAE) is proposed to enhance the annotation generalization performance. In this paper, two kinds of strategies, the annotation model and the annotation process, are proposed to solve the main problem of unbalanced data in image annotation. 1) For the annotation model itself, to improve the annotation effect of low frequency tags, we propose a balanced and stacked auto-encoder (BSAE) that can enhance training for low frequency tags. On the basis of this model, a robust BSAE (RBSAE) algorithm which enhances training for sub BSAE model by group is proposed to enhance the annotation stability. This strategy ensures that the model itself has a strong ability to deal with the problem of unbalanced data. 2) For the annotation process, we propose a framework of attribute discrimination annotation (ADA). We first take an unknown image. Then we construct a local equilibrium dataset based on the unknown image and discriminate the high- and low-frequency attribute of the image to determine the corresponding annotation process. One process called the local semantic propagation (LDE-SP) algorithm annotates the low frequency image and the RBSAE algorithm annotates the high frequency image. This strategy improves the overall image annotation effect and ensures that the annotation process has a strong ability to deal with the problem of unbalanced data. For each SAE (including BSAE and RBSAE) annotation model, we propose two kinds of optimization methods, namely, one that is based on non-linear optimization and one on linear optimization. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the previous models in many performance indices.","['Xiao Ke', 'Mingke Zhou', 'Yuzhen Niu', 'Wenzhong Guo']",746ecdd7-4820-4cf0-9164-64896d33f696,0,"['098f58bb-caf2-4b69-ba5a-c2322e5eb7c1', '18a188d1-8a56-43a4-80cd-4721211c2c71', '2053d4d5-9763-4c21-8942-e3ee44b4a495', '33abc1fc-50ea-4837-a4a0-65c1d4c0e0b7', '3c7950fc-a581-4ed3-bfc6-f3911a1395dd', '3e32a339-6ecc-4bb8-a3ff-8f9b96d9013d', '40835640-4c9a-4962-bb12-b9b180cf61fe', '53718c16-5098-4035-8d7d-ce8f98c837a3', '6677c001-30cb-49b8-8a86-8deabd2c86dd', '6a323522-b788-407e-b857-4fb19b9f2465', '774cb5a8-9649-4ba8-b1ee-7677b26c13cf', '7964a019-c3ce-4055-b974-41266d1f78ed', '826bd128-4189-4e04-8e8d-d2ebfd68c432', '84d47128-58d0-4187-aa44-389fde7d5c83', '84e105e6-d8f4-4438-8626-d0a3dfabf423', '89f10062-acf1-4171-b882-f3222c3a357e', '8acdbcc8-fc9f-454d-bd75-0b1f24e311a9', '8b39eac8-b73f-476f-9400-3a5704b04072', '8d446544-964a-478a-a5cd-0eb62197c99f', 'a085744f-00e3-4763-b206-bd190d8293df', 'a35bb362-03e8-442a-b2e3-22f9514f4951', 'a5385126-a3c0-462f-b3cf-489a3d3a2eab', 'a6d20b52-e874-45e2-bd45-29d877ab091c', 'b6374278-3e79-4c88-b234-a3c474465d3d', 'cab8a651-8e7d-4c24-a4c9-5fab2cd7481d', 'cb5e3b2d-a97e-461f-b99e-d4593d0ef2d7', 'cb7ca132-154e-44bc-89a5-834b89d48630', 'cce7f9ae-5c4e-4688-a13e-fcc9cf338221', 'ce3a9a34-d344-4bf4-a437-b013dac7877f', 'd6cd540c-fa36-4483-924c-b52b28fba3dd', 'e08b0b1d-6b52-447d-a93b-029016c717b1', 'e2f7a74a-8430-4463-94ce-fe85dfd309f9', 'e86be71e-f7a4-44e4-a95c-45c78618813d', 'f001c62f-1a32-4b6f-b1c7-afee1bb1cf9c', 'f800fc64-d0e0-456a-a9c5-2bec020b0c0e', 'fffeea62-e76f-4169-9eba-5a4e27b3fd9d']",Data equilibrium based automatic image annotation by fusing deep model and semantic propagation,Pattern Recognition,2017

65,"The performance of search operators varies across the different stages of the search/optimization process of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). In general, a single search operator may not do well in all these stages when dealing with different optimization and search problems. To mitigate this, adaptive search operator schemes have been introduced. The idea is that when a search operator hits a difficult patch (under-performs) in the search space, the EA scheme “reacts” to that by potentially calling upon a different search operator. Hence, several multiple-search operator schemes have been proposed and employed within EA. In this paper, a hybrid adaptive evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (HAEA/D) that employs four different crossover operators is suggested. Its performance has been evaluated on the well-known IEEE CEC’09 test instances. HAEA/D has generated promising results which compare well against several well-known algorithms including MOEA/D, on a number of metrics such as the inverted generational distance (IGD), the hyper-volume, the Gamma and Delta functions. These results are included and discussed in this paper.","['Wali Khan Mashwani', 'Abdellah Salhi', 'Ozgur Yeniay', 'Muhammad Asif Jan', 'Rasheeda Adeeb Khanum']",8078e036-4c61-4a4e-a293-79224309c3d8,0,"['0b1363e0-b6a4-4c99-8a2a-5f82850aee67', '10580ac5-b418-4b9e-81c2-0decacbe4e6e', '12152123-1984-42fc-84e6-c64ec5e6f739', '1989dc91-0354-4dc3-a26b-3ad1f918ba4f', '1af91dd3-7877-4702-ab76-492a7adf3e7c', '1c4ee006-e8a9-493c-bf1a-867c8e71ac59', '1f5b4b74-9c6f-43c8-b490-447ae33d6157', '239b671d-e6ce-4a92-b1bb-fd37ba217291', '24e44eb7-96c8-4dca-bac6-c9245c702ab4', '2ca6c673-a795-44c7-b1a2-9332d8ee56a2', '373569cf-e70a-45c4-b8c6-96f2e3773a58', '3bfe8f09-72f9-4b4c-8936-8b6d1836f232', '3f72cc31-b4b7-4734-a44c-17f94ec1250d', '3fde5e85-2435-4d6c-a97d-b0b29b869978', '47057fe0-ac67-4d70-b9d4-5d1ed69f406f', '49f2cdcb-c6dd-48c7-a0a2-c42297c4c78f', '51eb98b6-3010-4bb1-91d1-f5f1098a5319', '53020778-14a8-4dd5-b597-df130a3a17c6', '577464a8-bdc5-43d0-9aac-773134314330', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '67aa00dc-969f-4b9e-98e3-a9660466f235', '6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3', '6e21ddb1-4039-4ba2-9b64-a641aeb9039e', '7141d587-ec43-4c00-b453-4bb37b1e6e07', '75d43e11-dbc5-4baf-9a02-3e5b586c3688', '77c3f96d-c6cf-429d-b0a6-04e61ee0f17d', '88bbd7d3-4ff6-42ed-b9a5-a3a04e216f47', '8aad37e1-969d-4620-8cbb-50b7f3c5e587', '8b199d07-b8ea-4c69-a0e1-d2ad43c57309', '9136eff9-442d-4221-a12f-e2b1ff808472', '9d863568-1f07-46d0-b01b-eaea97983f7d', '9f7f87c1-326d-42ea-9cc3-77ceae210259', 'a4d89734-20f1-4668-962c-4fee3d813bdb', 'a75d1024-32fc-407c-973b-d797e112a76c', 'a8cf2734-1e02-4dea-a01f-53fa0b59de17', 'b5bdaccd-d49b-4be6-82d3-c1cfce8b8d2b', 'bac5da35-9009-41a3-b758-21aec812a9ee', 'c59e2749-28fe-4744-9d23-b2103e3b8aec', 'c7b3206a-2131-4849-bd8a-c447e56667bb', 'c808749a-b849-4bb8-9423-ca901f9c55ee', 'c853aa7f-7016-4bbc-88e7-962b8b2ed560', 'd3ce9acb-3e59-4d9b-854b-fda8f404f044', 'd57774b9-8ce3-4e5a-9d3e-ff13cdfac004', 'd7455ba2-aa02-4e80-a3e9-a88407ac6ada', 'd745a597-7a3f-4307-90a8-e5ef006d9fe8', 'e4b468aa-2b23-4229-8872-f9286464a19f']",Hybrid adaptive evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition,Applied Soft Computing,2017
66,"Full-duplex relaying has the potential to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of cooperative communication systems. Due to residual self-interference (RSI), increase of the relay power does not always contribute to SE improvement. To fully utilize full-duplex relaying in cooperative communications, the effect of RSI on the SE achieved by different relay schemes need to be investigated. In this paper, we study bounds on the SE of full-duplex relay channel with decode-forward (DF) relaying, compress-forward (CF) relaying, and amplify-forward (AF) relaying in the presence of RSI. For respective schemes, optimal relay power and the corresponding maximal SE are derived in closed-form. Bounds on the relay energy-efficiency (REE) are presented for different schemes, which are useful for system design under per-node energy efficiency constraint. Based on the SE performance, the conditions of employing full-duplex relay, criteria for selecting relay scheme among DF, CF, and AF schemes, and the conditions of adopting hybrid full-duplex or half-duplex mode are elaborated regarding to RSI strength. In summary, this paper investigates the relationship among SE, REE, and system design by taking into account the effect of RSI for a general class of cooperation schemes.","['Zhengchuan Chen', 'Tony Q.

68,"Area coverage problem in Directional Sensor Networks (DSNs) presents great research challenges including minimization of number of active sensors and overlapping sensing coverage area among them, determination of their active sensing directions in an energy-efficient way, etc. Existing solutions permit to execute coverage enhancement algorithms at each individual sensor nodes, leading to high communication and computation overheads, loss of energy and reduced sensing coverage. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of maximizing area coverage with minimum number of active nodes as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization problem for a clustered DSN. Due to its NP-completeness, we then develop a greedy alternate solution, namely  α -overlapping area coverage ( α -OAC). In  α -OAC, each cluster head (CH) takes the responsibility of determining the active member nodes and their sensing directions, where, each sensing node is allowed to have at most  α % coverage overlapping with its neighbors. The  α -OAC CHs activate a sensor node  iif  the later has sufficient residual energy and send other member nodes to the  sleep  state. The proposed  α -OAC system is distributed and scalable since it requires single-hop neighborhood information only.

69,"Semantic information is important for video event detection. How to automatically discover, model, and utilize semantic information to facilitate video event detection has been a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical video event detection model, which deliberately unifies the processes of underlying semantics discovery and event modeling from video data. Specially, different from most of the approaches based on manually pre-defined concepts, we devise an effective model to automatically uncover video semantics by hierarchically capturing latent static-visual concepts in frame-level and latent activity concepts (i.e., temporal sequence relationships of static-visual concepts) in segment-level. The unified model not only enables a discriminative and descriptive representation for videos, but also alleviates error propagation problem from video representation to event modeling existing in previous methods. A max-margin framework is employed to learn the model. Extensive experiments on four challenging video event datasets, i.e., MED11, CCV, UQE50, and FCVID, have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Chao Li', 'Zi Huang', 'Yang Yang', 'Jiewei Cao', 'Xiaoshuai Sun', 'Heng Tao Shen']",37e26220-1b46-4527-99b5-d4b4eecca188,0,"['040708e6-57de-4639-a488-3c68e918cad2', '109a6581-c16f-45f4-b2e9-88cb181f31d0', '153c5014-dc7a-44a8-a93f-5cd27f1193df', '18dca66b-ee08-4f29-a239-e622cc764b34', '1a639e42-09a6-4136-ab6e-97c41d093fd9', '1bd2029f-3807-4cfa-a9d3-5774748f6b14', '250b1d38-e61d-4108-8d01-09e2befbe9bc', '272b80bb-5efd-4a9e-b406-e6cd6cc771da', '314f9ab6-21e4-4957-aa1c-f3fb297ff605', '3d09a4b7-a613-4188-8137-3473e84cd6ec', '406a2ad2-5ff5-4206-8079-05c2e4a91c41', '40c2762a-a19b-4b6f-a5c3-792738dc51ba', '45312d4d-40d5-4262-baa0-0885a7229e69', '45910c92-c5fc-4a12-98a2-2e4d574e893c', '552df133-a47e-4f59-9c13-11ad66c93ad2', '5da724e4-e228-4e10-86d0-1183365c21f6', '5f290b18-d3c6-452d-966b-c8a11e88a5f6', '65dd0b28-392e-4f0e-9abb-b5a96c28290c', '6765f61a-6752-4d6b-8eec-de87796b53cb', '6baadbae-7672-4382-9221-56213b7c8ee2', '6c4ef5aa-d80d-4c56-b76c-394ec64e6ef0', '6dd46f95-cad2-4e02-b0f7-1c04cd64d5be', '7e574513-7f0e-47bf-b01b-35fbe3766af9', '8091619e-df5d-43fc-af07-d8099527402f', '842b8555-381a-4a6c-8435-27a31ee899a1', '855b7398-635e-49a8-90ff-177085ecc2b2', '8bc2cc39-5e81-4a24-a013-b6941a9fa0f4', '8d233be0-dfb9-4228-931b-2ea36edb3a81', '96b7b714-8cda-4213-81be-845a23caa5ed', '98be2848-7564-4287-aa08-e0780dac6d3d', '9aaf99e2-1d46-4068-a4da-475482887108', '9bc118e9-7213-4a4b-bc91-8c98656299c2', 'a3f373a6-4273-4678-9730-206f2d83a8b4', 'ac3a4ff4-f8cf-49f1-a1c4-cf57d1936355', 'ac5e3fe4-3b1d-412d-a03b-3247d39f62d5', 'adff9095-9133-469a-933a-a1d3e09c971e', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'c1255f60-5013-48aa-8b16-d4d2fe913941', 'c1b2c622-2bf9-4134-a6b7-0115f2439236', 'c535572c-b7ef-4aef-bdc9-d53d6147a2e5', 'c55985a2-7b46-49d4-b29f-e49bd1d66e57', 'c812244d-0de8-4e3c-8133-1e834bc9dbd0', 'c93eac1a-7d9a-48ab-9fb4-389c85bea00e', 'c9d99dab-b4b6-4c05-931b-9ebb4e3b812a', 'd080bd80-cc20-46a3-90fc-8f694bf51bf8', 'd7e0a139-2eba-4d98-8245-a5187895c105', 'dd83785a-dd19-41e3-9b25-ebabbd48d336', 'e2f7a74a-8430-4463-94ce-fe85dfd309f9', 'edb708f7-b53b-4d43-8ca9-9667518945cf', 'ede97388-caa9-4456-9cff-d5d8487782be', 'f2d49150-35de-4fd5-ac46-eb071d1cc73e', 'f84bedac-9fd7-4eba-b419-9084986b1e52']",Hierarchical Latent Concept Discovery for Video Event Detection,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017

71,"The configuration of the human brain system at rest, which is in a transitory phase among multistable states, remains unknown. To investigate the dynamic systems properties of the human brain at rest, we constructed an energy landscape for the state dynamics of the subcortical brain network, a critical center that modulates whole brain states, using resting state fMRI. We evaluated alterations in energy landscapes following perturbation in network parameters, which revealed characteristics of the state dynamics in the subcortical brain system, such as maximal number of attractors, unequal temporal occupations, and readiness for reconfiguration of the system. Perturbation in the network parameters, even those as small as the ones in individual nodes or edges, caused a significant shift in the energy landscape of brain systems. The effect of the perturbation on the energy landscape depended on the network properties of the perturbed nodes and edges, with greater effects on hub nodes and hubs-connecting edges in the subcortical brain system. Two simultaneously perturbed nodes produced perturbation effects showing low sensitivity in the interhemispheric homologous nodes and strong dependency on the more primary node among the two. This study demonstrated that energy landscape analysis could be an important tool to investigate alterations in brain networks that may underlie certain brain diseases, or diverse brain functions that may emerge due to the reconfiguration of the default brain network at rest.","['Jiyoung Kang', 'Chongwon Pae', 'Hae-Jeong Park']",843234ea-f2dd-40df-a884-3ed52b6604fc,0,"['0392ca9d-2cad-4095-9e28-fb8cf57a1800', '2624c35b-c630-43a3-82a6-4d6567e56d91', '32db239b-129d-4974-a289-7b1bbd0a02ce', '4b5af0dd-0171-4651-aefd-0b2e5330d92d', '661ffac4-a1fc-436d-964a-f30653d3f0f7', '6e851800-13e7-4117-90ad-76d354bef8ee', '7dc9b3e6-633f-43b7-b9d8-c55de01d9afc', '8861b710-125b-4392-aa0e-f23eb4e57801', '97d405e9-de62-43c8-8b82-a203a73b45dd', 'c0a6bf04-bf3c-4450-a77a-3239b961baae', 'e1ddf305-9d3f-4bba-9f80-3915e985c798', 'e51d8f70-dc9c-408a-9c53-1b78456d8e19', 'e8288eef-cc35-4528-b005-3366413fb029', 'f30c1caa-c297-4715-b3bc-0a338e553219']",Energy landscape analysis of the subcortical brain network unravels system properties beneath resting state dynamics,NeuroImage,2017
72,"Reducing number of projection angles and lowering current intensity of X-ray tube are two common ways for reducing CT dose. Though reduced radiation dose of CT scan can lower damage to human bodies, Few number of projection angles will result in incomplete projection data while lowering tube current intensity a declined signal to noise ratio of projection data. In this paper, two statistical methods based on sparsity constraint in shearlet domain for low-dose CT image were proposed to solve the above problems. For the limited angle scanned reconstruction, sparse representation of intermediate images in shearlet domain is added into the objective function as a regularization item by means of Augmented Lagrangian method so as to narrow down solution space. For the low X-ray tube scanned reconstruction, a penalized weighted least-squares (PWLS) approach based on discrete shearlet was introduced to improve the performance of resisting noise in sinogram. And then reconstruct CT images by Filtered Back-Projection method. According to experimental data, both of the two approaches can get high-quality images when projection data is far from meeting conditions of completeness or the signal to noise ratio of projection data declines sharply. The proposed algorithms can be used for attaining reconstructed images that clearly keep structural details when the radiation dose is decreased to 10% or even lower degrees.","['Haiyan Zhang', 'Liyi Zhang', 'Yunshan Sun', 'Jingyu Zhang']",50cb5547-31d5-475d-a2fc-f993788d6ded,0,"['20046276-3e3b-44e2-876f-cfcb1435c329', '2571408b-0461-40a1-ae74-d7e7a0dd7cf7', '36ee8bcc-83b5-4a2e-8b88-793e4025b126', '3708e30a-ac01-45c6-ab64-d7db8023adda', '4a64ab2f-4ec4-4725-a444-ca82f2ea7910', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '8ab8211d-6358-47b4-b4cb-578a914e4a86', '9ec51cc5-afb4-4647-a439-bd54e0772475', 'a53a3dda-b003-4d5c-96b1-e9afd8e35692', 'c1ceaf9b-605d-46a7-a9a0-2135cb856f3f', 'f56b877b-4060-4754-b303-e8140968544c', 'f6308eff-2d5b-47fb-a684-2787b53a3f63', 'fda1f1cb-7cc4-407e-b252-e21163bcde12']",Low dose CT image statistical reconstruction algorithms based on discrete shearlet,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2017
73,"Conventional matrix completion methods are generally based on rank minimization. These methods assume that the given matrix is of low-rank and the data points are drawn from a single subspace of low-dimensionality. Therefore they are not effective in completing matrices where the data are drawn from multiple subspaces. In this paper, we establish a novel matrix completion framework that is based on self-representation. Specifically, least-square, low-rank, and sparse self-representations based matrix completion algorithms are provided. The underlying idea is that one data point can be efficiently reconstructed by other data points belonging to a common subspace, where the missing entries are recovered so as to fit the common subspace. The proposed algorithms actually maximize the weighted correlations among the columns of a given matrix. We prove that the proposed algorithms are approximations for rank-minimization of the incomplete matrix. In addition, they are able to complete high-rank or even full-rank matrices when the data are drawn from multiple subspaces. Comparative studies are conducted on synthetic datasets, natural image inpainting tasks, temperature prediction task, and collaborative filtering tasks. The results show that the proposed algorithms often outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms in various tasks.","['Jicong Fan', 'Tommy W. S.

74,"Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) is an event-driven simulation approach in which a real dynamic process is imitated as it progresses over time. It has been recognized as a powerful technique for the quantitative analysis of complex construction operations. However, current DES modelling strategies/frameworks implicitly rely on queuing structures which are too rigid to easily describe systems with complex behaviour common in construction, e.g., multi-tasking resources and/or role changes of entities. Queuing networks are one of the most common elements of DES systems and have been used to model a wide range of problems, but they lack the generality to easily model the complex decision mechanisms required to, e.g., efficiently multi-task or dynamically determine the best role for an entity. This research proposes a new modelling approach for construction that replaces Queue-Based (QB) DES, with its implicit queuing network control, with Non-Queue-Based (NQB) DES that explicitly defines the decision mechanisms of a model. It utilises a new conceptual modelling paradigm for simulation, Hierarchical Control Conceptual Modelling, which was developed to address similar issues with control mechanisms in health care simulation. This new approach is especially beneficial for the construction industry where determining effective decision making mechanisms is of significant importance for optimising, e.g., logistics and resource utilisation. This research investigates the benefits of the proposed approach for DES models in construction by investigating three earthmoving case studies. Although the scope of this research is limited to DES modelling in construction, the outcomes of the proposed NQB paradigm in construction translate to other domains that utilise DES for solving complex problems.","['Hamed Golzarpoor', 'Vicente González', ""Michael J.

75,"Echo State Networks, ESNs, are standardly composed of additive units undergoing sigmoid function activation. They consist of a randomly recurrent neuronal infra-structure called reservoir. Coming up with a good reservoir depends mainly on picking up the right parameters for the network initialization. Human expertise as well as repeatedly tests may sometimes provide acceptable parameters. Nevertheless, they are non-guaranteed. On the other hand, optimization techniques based on evolutionary learning have proven their strong effectiveness in unscrambling optimal solutions in complex spaces. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the most popular continuous evolutionary algorithms. Throughout this paper, a PSO algorithm is associated to ESN to pre-train some fixed weights values within the network. Once the network's initial parameters are set, some untrained weights are selected for optimization. The new weights, already optimized, are re-squirted to the network which launches its normal training process. The performances of the network are a subject of the error and the time processing evaluation metrics. The testing results after PSO pre-training are compared to those of ESN without optimization and other existent approaches.

76,"Despite ‘knowledge transfer’ emerged as a separate field of study at least three decades ago, its academic literature remains rather fragmented. To reduce complexity, several journals’ special issues have attempted to frame up the literature both in a qualitative way and in a quantitative manner. Although these reviews help to bring some order to a flourishing literature, the theoretical background of knowledge transfer field of study still needs clarification. Who are their foremost scholars? How do they gather in visible or invisible colleges? How far the scientific communities of such domain have evolved over time? Has the knowledge transfer topic gained the status of an independent scientific domain? This article aims at shedding light on the knowledge transfer domain by mapping the invisible colleges on which the discipline is based. Drawing evidence from a network analysis of the backwards citations of the second generation of knowledge transfer studies, the authors point out that although the entire scientific domain has reached a strongly connected international dimension, it still manifests a persistent fragmentation. The paradoxical presence of a popular scientific domain without a proper independent theoretical body is consequently underlined.","['Alberto Gherardini', 'Alberto Nucciotti']",eef8c676-0c1d-4cf7-bf53-e1bd98c9e7cd,0,"['32d96f09-ff41-4af3-baf5-78ef0c79b368', '3bfd397c-f742-4a64-8c50-ab50405ca1ed', '4e831b83-a98f-43a8-a5c2-f0f013a5b909', '57037984-9851-411e-b477-bd268950b7fb', '652f40af-a6fe-48d6-b8b0-868a3f5943c3', '8367b612-53a1-41e2-9123-763201f9d95a', '95d710af-b77e-42e5-a33d-b80771fd7175', '9e2dcd0d-d22a-47f7-b76a-6c3c0b189c24', 'b8ec2fae-6365-4e5a-94ac-abf8e735c60a', 'baa0eaee-ca00-4d0e-a81c-a240919bade3', 'bb3fe85b-d927-402f-b393-a6b164789ce1', 'cb700602-0681-4f6f-af17-838b687b3f88', 'e6b6199d-4aa7-472f-add6-72a837253ff3', 'efea2966-0b4d-4041-8dd7-467f45e949b9']",Yesterday’s giants and invisible colleges of today.

77,"The level set method is commonly used to model dynamically evolving fronts and interfaces. In this work, we present new methods for evolving fronts with a specified velocity field or in the surface normal direction on 3D unstructured tetrahedral meshes with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The level set field is located at the nodes of the tetrahedral cells and is evolved using new upwind discretizations of Hamilton–Jacobi equations combined with a Runge–Kutta method for temporal integration. The level set field is periodically reinitialized to a signed distance function using an iterative approach with a new upwind gradient. The details of these level set and reinitialization methods are discussed. Results from a range of numerical test problems are presented.","['Nathaniel R.

78,"Governance provides the authoritative framework for coordinating activities in open source development. Prior studies of open source governance have largely focused on its changing nature over time. In this work, we argue that the nature of governance varies across open source communities, and, in its evolution, multiple traces of authority may co-exist. We propose that such multiplicity can be understood by close examination of the authoritative structures embedded in coordination processes. We collected eight years of data on the coordination related to version control of the Linux kernel. Drawing on in-depth qualitative analysis, we investigate how coordination processes with different authoritative structures come together in the governance of open source software. We trace four coordination processes (autocratic clearing, oligarchic recursion, federated self-governance, and meritocratic idea-testing), each grounded in different authoritative structures (autocracy, oligarchy, federation, meritocracy) with their own form of legitimation. We offer a two-fold contribution in this paper. First, we enhance the open source governance literature by advancing a new theoretical perspective in which governance is seen as a configuration of coordination processes. Configurations give complementary support and are a source of tension and renewal. Second, we articulate a view on the conceptual relationship between governance and coordination where these concepts are understood as a duality, both working together to give rise to efficient and dynamic organizing in open source.","['Maha Shaikh', 'Ola Henfridsson']",2f2cd059-9aef-408f-aca3-dab38ee096c7,0,"['03292aaa-ba6a-4266-a01d-0e7a46dc6586', '0331f459-20b4-479a-a137-0c4b9e5cc973', '06c5eb08-674c-4236-8787-ae7db8dc6e3d', '1814833f-fcc7-40ad-bbd0-af5a57817dba', '1f794cd9-dc55-4148-8665-429baa4cc53b', '23b33079-27cf-4aa7-9355-6a50ae37071d', '25e98246-bcf2-4f6a-bb01-8389d93a864c', '26339b29-1608-4b44-91d1-515704f62e9f', '2710ef00-fe7b-4518-a978-a064fe559cc5', '27c273a0-ee8c-4019-8fb4-10bff1b1af6c', '2cb911ba-3de4-435f-acd8-0be14e070cfb', '33c954e7-50ff-4c4c-8b5c-1e50f7482586', '3401d0e7-cafb-4c19-8dc3-419ce9247ae9', '37c54a85-5a4d-4e64-8c27-dc1aca5ed10d', '3e3e3325-f3f4-4b4b-8ec2-32807dfa80a6', '4189a9ff-6da2-4c0a-a3e7-d1399611be7b', '4df2fdd2-d12f-48b7-a15a-d8fa16bd4cc5', '4e8295ac-a72e-4fe7-9a75-b3392054dc71', '541641ab-a9d8-4aa8-ac1c-29d1bb1057a3', '5b805a69-1652-4b4c-8c54-e6bb91c71c27', '7612a6d3-11f5-479c-921c-43743b75fc30', '7ccf7196-c18c-4b42-aa61-01c03b105f17', '833312a1-24d8-4c21-a32a-a8284a3a7edb', '87641aeb-d656-4073-9125-e6d910814ac6', '9056c038-3e34-4ffc-bab2-ec844d232531', '9b89c380-b46a-4a53-87b6-67c6afd75277', '9c5c6de5-1d66-47b2-af91-0cf6001f71ce', '9e94aa1c-b52f-4879-82b5-cfdad5073e81', 'b178f746-32c8-4389-b139-dcb210a13f87', 'b7f22ee4-809d-47e8-a037-eb4518fdb7c2', 'bb2a47a9-9645-480d-9f2c-9f4d9e496ca7', 'c2695629-9acf-4a15-bbf2-f327684e0906', 'ca3d7638-3ec9-441f-a48e-28e6cea50da1', 'cff823f5-5359-4646-9053-9483a0a26a0a', 'd2738c3d-028f-4b84-9aaa-dd8f764e5909', 'd307d0d8-0f51-48bb-969c-950d75c19eb8', 'd40742eb-d2f7-4eae-a57e-a94fbb3d1758', 'd9829744-e931-4b00-ad48-a841cf2f1c02', 'ddac0b02-0db1-45b0-a4d0-ff5482f5319b', 'e3bfe8a2-a1f9-4b6c-a3f7-4b336077c1b5', 'e453703d-0959-4744-953b-fd65c5f5fc3c', 'e49b6fc1-1c80-4b57-85a9-d7aa3a938270', 'e5cd981c-3333-4e6c-8d95-785b8ac0df79', 'fb784573-0bd7-4640-910d-d746036e6ee4']",Governing open source software through coordination processes,Information and Organization,2017
79,"In this paper, we propose the M-optimality criterion for designing constant-stress accelerated degradation tests (ADTs). The newly proposed criterion concentrates on the degradation mechanism equivalence rather than evaluation precision or prediction accuracy which is usually considered in traditional optimization criteria. Subject to the constraints of total sample number, test termination time as well as the stress region, an optimum constant-stress ADT plan is derived by determining the combination of stress levels and the number of samples allocated to each stress level, when the degradation path comes from inverse Gaussian (IG) process model with covariates and random effects. A numerical example is presented to verify the robustness of our proposed optimum plan and compare its efficiency with other test plans. Results show that, with a slightly relaxed requirement of evaluation precision and prediction accuracy, our proposed optimum plan reduces the dispersion of the estimated acceleration factor between the usage stress level and a higher accelerated stress level, which makes an important contribution to reliability demonstration and assessment tests.","['Han Wang', 'Yu Zhao', 'Xiaobing Ma', 'Hongyu Wang']",0ec35b8e-07af-46f4-b1d9-d1c7a8b0e36a,0,"['0259a1d2-d338-422c-8913-4d2b582e759e', '03cf2e96-218e-4c4f-8f09-1f4a13d2c9eb', '0919fee7-a7f9-41f0-8d84-ac11c1bb07dd', '0a08974e-639c-40a0-8373-91ff08b77924', '159f5035-62ed-49b0-9e08-51c8ab6f3bef', '39e35802-926e-4c44-addf-38761a22d373', '4d7b22ba-86a9-4ee5-b605-48a25723c11a', '66ec9cfa-dea6-4c4d-969f-a54c26c68792', '68686b77-a435-42ae-aa83-27788e22833d', '6d5eff85-bf18-479c-8378-ba7e8fc95fe2', '737d13ac-12d8-4230-b291-1be7dd663d73', '86a7f4cf-b0f8-4604-ad3a-cde5648c6cdd', 'a4dfbdd5-787a-4989-8503-d687265052d8', 'b30bc71b-1679-4125-aa1f-5e06a90cdd3b', 'd584be5b-29b6-41bd-aff1-eb6a68e952a8', 'eacf7157-4a93-4fb5-a50c-dbefb8fd4694']",Optimal design of constant-stress accelerated degradation tests using the M-optimality criterion,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,2017
80,"In the era of biometric research the recent developments in real time biometric world, iris recognition is considered as one of the most important approach used in person identification based biometric authentication. This approach is considered than the other biometric authentication methods such as behavioral biometrics which specially includes Keystroke, Speaker Recognition whereas the another side of biometric authentication is Physical biometrics which specially includes Fingerprint Recognition, Voice Recognition, Finger Geometry Recognition and Facial Recognition. From these considerations, the hybrid approach of Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial for iris recognition has been proposed. The novelty of this proposed method results in improving the Accuracy, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR) and Equal Error Rate (EER) for the given iris image. In addition to this, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used for iris image pre-processing. Circular Hough transform (CHT) and Canny edge detection (CED) are applied for iris image segmentation which segments the individual region of the input images. After the image is segmented, Fourier transform and Bernstein polynomial have been applied to extract the features from the segmented iris image, which is the most important step for obtaining the texture details, which are independent and uncorrelated even for identical pairs. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for image classification. Perhaps, Feature extraction and Classification of iris image are mainly based on the rich texture details present in iris image. Finally, our proposed system is applied on UBIRIS database and our research experiment provides better accuracy and recognition rates compared to the combined iris recognition techniques such as Fourier transform with SVM, Bernstein polynomial with SVM, Fourier transform with KSVM, Bernstein polynomial with KSVM and hybridization of Fourier and Bernstein polynomial with SVM.","['M.

82,"Annotation of large-scale datasets can promisingly be done by crowd workers in a time and cost effective way. A major challenge in this area is how we aggregate the opinions received from multiple workers to derive the final judgment. Most of the crowd opinion aggregation models known so far deal with independent opinions, where the crowd workers provide their opinions unanimously and these are not visible to everyone. In real life, there are applications where an annotator can see others’ opinions. This incurs a higher chance of getting biased by the other opinions. This paper addresses a new problem, hereafter termed as dependent judgment analysis, and proposes a method to derive the final judgment from a given set of independent and dependent opinions. Here, a Markov chain based aggregation method is used to handle the opinions of the crowd workers for finding a consensus.

83,"Providing equitable access to healthcare services in rural and remote communities is an ongoing challenge that faces most governments. By increasing access to specialty expertise, telemedicine may be a potential solution to this problem. Regardless of its potential, many telemedicine initiatives do not progress beyond the research phase, and are not implemented into mainstream practice. One reason may be that some telemedicine services are developed without the appropriate planning to ascertain community needs and clinical requirements. The aim of this paper is to report the development of a planning framework for telemedicine services based on needs assessment. The presented framework is based on the key processes in needs assessment, Penchansky and Thomas’s dimensions of access, and Bradshaw’s types of need. This proposed planning framework consists of two phases. Phase one comprises data collection and needs assessment, and includes assessment of availability and expressed needs; accessibility; perception and affordability. Phase two involves prioritising the demand for health services, balanced against the known limitations of supply, and the implementation of an appropriate telemedicine service that reflects and meets the needs of the community. Using a structured framework for the planning of telemedicine services, based on need assessment, may help with the identification and prioritisation of community health needs.","['Sharifah AlDossary', 'Melinda Martin-Khan', 'Natalie Bradford', 'Nigel R.

84,"A low-complexity vertex-projection method based on a pyramidal trilateration technique suitable for node position estimation in ad-hoc/sensor network scenarios is presented. Also a maximum likelihood position location is introduced to compare position location performance. The proposed methodology relies solely on range estimate between neighboring nodes on the connecting path linking the node of interest to the reference location access points. Feasibility is studied in the presence of measuring and routing noise and path dispersion that depend on the node density and reachability of radius. Results show that adequate proximity information can be achieved for a wide variety of multi-hop scenarios. Number of reference nodes is increased and shown that three references are sufficient for position location. Noisy environments where iid and non-iid random variables are generated are also shown, where the proposed algorithm achieves good performance in terms of the rms error position.","['Cesar Vargas-Rosales', 'D.

85,"ABSTRACTWe examined three different ways to integrate spatial and temporal data in kernel density estimation methods (KDE) to identify space–time clusters of geographic events. Spatial data and time data are typically measured in different units along respective dimensions. Therefore, spatial KDE methods require special extensions when incorporating temporal data to detect spatiotemporal clusters of geographical event. In addition to a real-world data set, we applied the proposed methods to simulated data that were generated through random and normal processes to compare results of different kernel functions. The comparison is based on hit rates and values of a compactness index with considerations of both spatial and temporal attributes of the data. The results show that the spatiotemporal KDE (STKDE) can reach higher hit rates while keeping identified hotspots compact. The implementation of these STKDE methods is tested using the 2012 crime event data in Akron, Ohio, as an example. The results show that...","['Jay Lee', 'Junfang Gong', 'Sheng-Wen Li']",12935088-45cb-418d-85a3-f960370128f6,0,"['227f17fa-1498-45ba-993b-86ce7dbe51bf', '314f3781-1dc5-4ad4-be26-95e51c370aa4', '3ffb80a4-26af-4572-807a-846692387d45', '4e8a2a91-644c-4e78-b6b2-bd344cb429f7', '5d83613a-f9ca-43ca-bc2e-a71271e1a9d2', '638ded06-ec78-40f0-a077-288823fcae00', 'ae7f0dfe-e093-47c2-9e85-ef03fc823913', 'bc9e6f5b-b307-45fe-9838-b6ca4dbd27aa', 'e3a40536-5580-4c24-b273-4fa4dab2579e', 'e6e4d7fa-eccd-4363-84cf-f8c5290e82d1', 'ec6a75c5-05ed-4f92-9251-3c0cd3d5d4a4', 'ee114785-af6c-4c57-8014-56aecb302c7b']",Exploring spatiotemporal clusters based on extended kernel estimation methods,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2017
86,"An n-radio k-coloring of a graph G is a function 1 : V(G) -> {0, 1, . . . , n}, satisfying the condition vertical bar l(u) l(nu)vertical bar >= k + 1 - d(u, nu) for all distinct u, nu is an element of V(G). The radio k -chromatic number rc(k)(G) of G is the minimum n such that G admits an n-radio k-coloring. We establish a general technique for computing the lower bound for rc(k)(G) of a general graph G and derive a formula for it. Using this formula we compute lower bounds of rc(k)(G) for several graphs and provide alternative short proofs for a number of previously established tight lower bounds. In particular, we progress on a conjecture by Kchikech, Khentioufa and Togni (DMGT 2007) regarding rc(k)(.) of infinite paths and reprove a result by Liu and Zhu (SIDMA 2005).

The multi-legged structure is crucial in providing redundancy and robustness in the interaction with unstructured environments and terrains.

89,"In this paper, we present a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system which integrates measurements from multiple cameras to achieve robust pose tracking for autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) in unknown complex environments. We analyze the iterative optimizations for pose tracking and map refinement of visual SLAM in multi-camera cases. The analysis ensures the soundness and accuracy of each optimization update. A well-known monocular visual SLAM system is extended to utilize two cameras with non-overlapping fields of view (FOVs) in the final implementation. The resulting visual SLAM system enables autonomous navigation of an MAV in complex scenarios. The theory behind this system can easily be extended to multi-camera configurations, when the onboard computational capability allows this. For operations in large-scale environments, we modify the resulting visual SLAM system to be a constant-time robust visual odometry. To form a full visual SLAM system, we further implement an efficient back-end for loop closing. The back-end maintains a keyframe-based global map, which is also used for loop-closure detection. An adaptive-window pose-graph optimization method is proposed to refine keyframe poses of the global map and thus correct pose drift that is inherent in the visual odometry. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed visual SLAM system for applications onboard of MAVs in experiments with both autonomous and manual flights. The pose tracking results are compared with ground truth data provided by an external tracking system.","['Shaowu Yang', 'Sebastian A.

90,"The Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve is well-known in evaluating classification performance in biomedical field. Owing to its superiority in dealing with imbalanced and cost-sensitive data, the ROC curve has been exploited as a popular metric to evaluate and find out disease-related genes (features). The existing ROC-based feature selection approaches are simple and effective in evaluating individual features. However, these approaches may fail to find real target feature subset due to their lack of effective means to reduce the redundancy between features, which is essential in machine learning. In this paper, we propose to assess feature complementarity by a trick of measuring the distances between the misclassified instances and their nearest misses on the dimensions of pairwise features. If a misclassified instance and its nearest miss on one feature dimension are far apart on another feature dimension, the two features are regarded as complementary to each other. Subsequently, we propose a novel filter feature selection approach on the basis of the ROC analysis. The new approach employs an efficient heuristic search strategy to select optimal features with highest complementarities. The experimental results on a broad range of microarray data sets validate that the classifiers built on the feature subset selected by our approach can get the minimal balanced error rate with a small amount of significant features. Compared with other ROC-based feature selection approaches, our new approach can select fewer features and effectively improve the classification performance.","['Lei Sun', 'Jun Wang', 'Jinmao Wei']",bbaed62e-4f8b-497d-b144-aa329e7de6c5,0,"['02e019cb-a94c-4632-8bed-81b73ae9231a', '0429c82a-08e5-404d-ba50-f28aac5f3595', '089d789c-db9f-4204-8d45-9c99fa878721', '0e30a566-1fe0-4e63-b69e-21d23ba3187a', '128412eb-941e-4649-909e-51d0c9bf77fb', '2a0b698a-941b-4a78-9da1-2bd0357ef609', '32ec6d48-1498-4772-ad8e-3163296bc4e2', '3b1e602b-7f54-49a0-a1e6-84309b17e46c', '4c43ee71-e19b-478d-9aec-c2c8b77f71f9', '4e0d2792-5f82-4e13-812c-781172f92e40', '4fb87930-7f6c-4f03-ae22-32445138ec83', '5ada24de-6409-4bf1-b005-7af4b43c9cf6', '6ce70ba0-2e0e-4c08-9bbb-2597b12d0738', '7ac72350-525f-4ced-9650-55dab1fa6d40', '81b29737-0e8a-433b-8fe1-2c4ec16b85cc', '8f5a1e7a-a1b8-4f78-9aa0-b79983df2c27', 'b1af4155-ef55-46b2-ac86-db930d4c3ed7', 'b1e0b2d0-8a1e-42f5-8645-9fae30b8636f', 'b9c7ddad-7139-43a7-837e-6c174e6d7e9e', 'c5e0c041-01f2-452a-b261-d7902b6109f2', 'e990f9a6-465e-4fce-9f0c-744c9f9997f8', 'fd6c6e12-c71c-40d1-8492-f70078c8ee29', 'ff9789d8-031b-4460-a36f-703a1a74bd09']",AVC: Selecting discriminative features on basis of AUC by maximizing variable complementarity,BMC Bioinformatics,2017

92,"Despite the introduction of novel energy harvesting technologies, the lifetime of a sensor platform remains one of its most important performance metrics. Performance, however, may also be assessed in terms of the fraction of events which may successfully/unsuccessfully be detected and reported within a time interval of interest, i.e., mission time. Such a performance metric, here termed event goodput, is key for all random event-driven networks, ranging from surveillance and intrusion detection applications operating in time critical scenarios, to mobile and wearable crowd-sensed ecosystems, where mobile sensors are utilized by a number of different applications. When reporting the appearance of a series of possible, but unknown, phenomena, predicting which event goodput may be obtained during the planned mission time is challenging. In this article, we address this issue by reducing the network-wide problem to the analysis of the performance of individual nodes, in terms of their capability of handling given fractions of event arrivals under fixed probabilistic guarantees. This is obtained as a function of mission time, event arrival and energy consumption models of different, detection and communication schemes, all realistic.","['Lorenzo Donatiello', 'Gustavo Marfia']",3d73ba18-02f9-422e-b759-a3fc4eb68ae6,0,"['037af064-7d6a-4cd8-ba77-88da9d1a6f57', '223c58c3-d206-4bb3-946e-7c80e6c71f96', '251ccaca-a371-4434-9e15-fd843a5bd603', '2b9aa4a3-65dc-4f1e-a8a2-ef66e44c643d', '2c02f701-f2f4-40f8-b005-419d93de581e', '4086c5c9-ff20-40b0-b407-5c59faa1a94c', '4634a7b7-7509-4d55-98d4-75674d50672f', '503b56e2-d015-4f85-8e7c-aae218576132', '59def0e5-fa51-4dbb-9bc2-53b33a068656', '6296bb1e-3d7b-42c3-a7eb-792130293ea5', '64e7b0c9-edfe-40df-8104-e479c212e97c', '6d16eb90-bd0d-4a27-82e3-1bc844c2945e', '6fd63948-53a0-43d2-a072-b4671c17b46d', '7c78de8c-43ea-49c5-a216-34ed804d16e6', '8a93205f-cd08-48be-90a1-0bcfd3658411', '8df2bd8c-3c13-439d-bff1-a573d850d2e2', 'ada4eba5-6923-4b92-bf17-9fd360a90b14', 'bb7c3837-38b3-4ea8-a4f9-774c34900319', 'bfe292ad-d53a-4ea2-809d-0579d6b8b9a9', 'cf31570b-b821-4b9a-ac4e-d981f9bf2a61', 'd3a6b91d-9fad-4438-82e2-ac405428cae2', 'd90e5206-b69d-47ee-bc6e-a5a367b85355', 'de42b57c-d504-4226-9580-d0da7a663d9c', 'e9e45e77-7dd0-4da0-9e74-b4d468626027', 'fb040bbc-a6a7-4248-bc20-77260b207c32', 'fbbf126a-1795-4c8d-9c11-6eabf07a778b', 'ff6908b4-b252-424c-afd8-98bbd25f18a3']",Models and performance evaluation of event goodput in sensor platforms,Computer Networks,2017
93,"Contamination of water in a distributed water network can cause serious public health disaster. The contamination can occur at one part of the network and may spread to different region depending of the flow pattern of water. It is essential to monitor contamination using distributed water networks and a practical way to do so, is through the application of sensor networks. Sensors are used for timely detection of the presence of various contaminants in water. To accurately and optimally map the contamination distribution, it is quintessential to place sensors in optimal positions in the network whereby the goal is to minimize the net effect from contamination – inadvertent or intentional. The demand of water at different locations in the network can be uncertain leading to various flow patterns. The location of contamination within the network can also be uncertain. With these uncertainties, the propagation of the contaminant in the network varies accordingly, thus affecting the impact from contamination. An optimal placement of the sensors should account for these uncertainties. A mitigation response of contamination, as detected by a sensor network is manifested in a decreased demand due to public information as a function of distance from the sensor. The overall impact from contamination is estimated by including impacts, as found in the downstream of the sensor in the network. In this work, the most efficient network of sensors is designed by including demand and location uncertainty as well as response from downstream from the sensor. The problem is solved by formulating a nonlinear, stochastic mixed integer problem. Generally stochastic formulation requires repeated function calculations. In our research, a reweighting approach is used instead of repeated function simulation to estimate an expected value of the impact. The reweighting scheme along with a novel sampling technique has been implemented through a Better Optimization algorithm for Nonlinear Uncertain Systems (BONUS). The results are compared with that from TEVA SPOT, which neither takes into account demand uncertainty nor downstream response from the source of contamination (attack). Inclusion of downstream response and demand uncertainty on optimal sensor placement in water network systems show better sensor layouts with minimum impacts from contamination.","['Rajib Mukherjee', 'Urmila M.

95,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, the synchronisation problems of multi-agent systems with asynchronous and synchronous event-triggered control under a novel event-triggered condition are solved. Our event-triggered control protocols only require each agent to send its state information to its neighbouring agents when an event-triggered condition is satisfied. Such control protocols substantially reduce the cost of communication. It is worth mentioning that the proposed protocols also ensure that the synchronisation of the multi-agent system with asynchronous and synchronous event-triggered can be achieved asymptotically without Zeno-behaviour. Meanwhile, an ultimate synchronisation trajectory is given. Moreover, our results are applied to solve the formation control problem. Some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our protocols.","['Dongming Liu', 'Jianchang Liu']",2c606e07-c17f-4ca4-81e2-4aa78121daa8,0,"['0bf829c3-d555-4745-b1a5-7c5ce8acbff6', '0daae350-5433-48f2-aa41-9ecc9dbfbcc6', '1b449c68-2b9f-48dc-8b0c-9539613fe6ef', '1bc6e684-edc7-4e6e-8bee-93f406ceea96', '25b8d6d7-725b-400a-b9ff-9b51e1199d5f', '2768199c-b9d6-4001-94d3-e6429c93bc5f', '36f4d1ef-6c87-412f-98a5-9475f5a1f888', '3a96d54e-870e-4d93-9a21-0632f2798db2', '461eb2fe-62b1-4ab1-b17e-1b4986a8f414', '50817042-d3a2-4418-a8bb-43780db93a59', '5593bd6b-496d-4d63-afc1-d48d3797c910', '594a6763-746d-4039-8c75-fd33fc4f60e6', '5df4024a-1306-48d3-8edc-338c6a25c070', '612ae9bc-1d8e-42d6-9026-8aa144bf0759', '66336e41-ee1c-4362-8b5c-32a3e4ab0dc8', '899915f6-2d74-4ccc-be25-071123051cfc', 'ab35dc68-62bd-4c54-81d3-9a8406827489', 'c25fc4ea-b6a0-40b3-bc88-ed19de8feb66', 'ce8682b5-ce54-45be-a485-d8cc162968c9', 'e0d7caa9-ec8a-49f6-9cd8-36c77e409bbb', 'eb6a0795-ae7d-4b1e-ba29-cc9de2483112', 'eeea714f-0127-48ac-af89-cc640549de25', 'fa668285-77d3-4ccb-bcda-e06495f76b3c']",Synchronisation of linear high-order multi-agent systems via event-triggered control with limited communication,International Journal of Systems Science,2017

The ULoRaS scheme takes advantage of the transmit–receive coordinated beamforming procedure to achieve large array gains. It has no dimensionality constraint and can be applied to the generalized OSA architecture, including both the fully connected and the widely discussed non-OSA cases. It is shown that the proposed ULoRaS algorithm for the novel OSA design is a good compromise of the performance and the required hardware complexity.","['Nuan Song', 'Tao Yang', 'Huan Sun']",902f0d2d-223a-4c5f-8cf4-96aad53da09e,0,"['0876f092-8c17-4485-9c1d-069cd2ff23db', '1b934bda-fb88-4f6d-8032-160bdeb680ff', '1c51be67-2491-4df6-95e1-c9403b173a6b', '346ef166-6e5c-4b91-aefa-ab7772bfc443', '369c3d88-a460-49e5-9900-f3df356350e6', '4f1448d5-3f22-4ad2-b0c4-1cb66ddea741', '57695353-7b58-4796-862f-db6f1cd8c80b', '5db1f8dd-aeb0-42fd-8ce1-d86ccfe51332', '6422da57-5532-46e5-ae6f-047257b00fdc', '646871e4-f86a-4501-aa86-ca215cb4ea89', '6de05dcb-2e39-46d2-bf91-d7bd8f59ca21', '7b327c10-8ce7-4c27-8a53-374c5f2b5b53', '7c748bf2-16f5-410d-ae8d-c9b2bd720e29', '8b8c63cb-b86b-46e7-9a10-a3e8339f48da', 'ae7acb26-9841-4ca8-89bd-868192245a35', 'c3fe9864-aec6-480f-a7ab-5a706dc50fa3', 'e2301117-a45b-4b2e-8cc5-599b2aaa980c', 'e5796c03-864c-44e5-8084-1933e0a7e80e', 'ee52fa3c-7154-4652-9f00-1baac42e15b8', 'f17f15fa-73b2-42d9-a95f-59e5fa95918b', 'f57ee870-3e44-49ba-a375-05d0a7fc9b66', 'f6a75dc9-0bce-4613-8af8-631afcd7afe4']",Overlapped Subarray Based Hybrid Beamforming for Millimeter Wave Multiuser Massive MIMO,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,2017
98,"In this paper, we propose a general compositional approach for modelling and verification of stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs). We extend Hybrid CSP (HCSP), a very expressive process algebra-like formal modeling language for hybrid systems, by introducing probability and stochasticity to model SHSs, which we call stochastic HCSP (SHCSP). Especially, non-deterministic choice is replaced by probabilistic choice, ordinary differential equations are replaced by stochastic differential equations (SDEs), and communication interrupts are generalized by communication interrupts with weights. We extend Hybrid Hoare Logic to specify and reason about SHCSP processes: On the one hand, we introduce the probabilistic formulas for describing probabilistic states, and on the other hand, we propose the notions of local stochastic differential invariants for characterizing SDEs and global loop invariants for repetition. Throughout the paper, we demonstrate our approach by an aircraft running example.","['Shuling Wang', 'Naijun Zhan', 'Lijun Zhang']",0b244c94-5e47-48a9-b9a7-f03815c8ef15,0,"['03b29256-2ca5-48f6-bdb3-7902a06237f2', '106a60ea-4e1d-43fe-95fd-c3c65e63a82f', '138f9904-044e-48a7-8f64-85d1a9961ad1', '14352aa0-6d0d-4e38-a2f7-034a727cc1a0', '16db31cd-8075-4598-a356-2e1f943c06bf', '35c8c06c-2ad0-46b4-9e92-2d684f3abd94', '3949f595-2b19-4d0c-993e-bd24ee798194', '6292712f-db46-49ef-a886-1c2307d7663e', '68e24914-2cfb-4935-a9d6-feed47142bd2', '7531d912-1414-4ef9-b85a-2abe66fbe8f9', '76b18f00-e088-4c33-b069-dd086d5ee735', '862c4d86-8f28-41c3-a1e8-11a645daba3d', '86ef09e7-5cd4-4c74-8ad0-e95fe7b48851', '8b0fba7e-2042-47b0-b917-30916846e54a', '915daa23-0863-4e59-a305-8d6c43bf7657', '98962ded-5386-4cb9-8779-baa3a17e921f', '99cab49f-3acb-43c8-a46a-0404353587ad', '9bb5f6eb-10e9-4e10-a6ee-29af7c0e031c', 'acb50193-6274-4601-892b-c7306adc46e2', 'c11b1326-31b3-423b-acac-cd9723fe1451', 'ce01ee2a-e960-4c17-835a-43cf48c9a9a6', 'd1375943-886d-438a-853c-bd31bbcb47f2', 'e35d097f-6d71-4306-8bd4-628a7d1bf4b0', 'e3c6e4de-b015-4c8d-ab24-cf99f45fd845', 'f04bc95f-f9b6-468d-bb89-69157056501a', 'f44ea900-52ff-45a7-9f82-204281394ffe', 'f6f9d4c1-e655-4abf-a901-37d7d9661484', 'f7839908-e59d-49fc-9b22-7d4eccf29ecc', 'ff0a067b-7937-4dfd-b580-98f8dc97474d']",A Compositional Modelling and Verification Framework for Stochastic Hybrid Systems,Formal Aspects of Computing,2017
99,"Background and objective#R##N#Induction of labor (IOL) is a medical procedure used to initiate uterine contractions to achieve delivery. IOL entails medical risks and has a significant impact on both the mother's and newborn's well-being. The assistance provided by an automatic system to help distinguish patients that will achieve labor spontaneously from those that will need late-term IOL would help clinicians and mothers to take an informed decision about prolonging pregnancy. With this aim, we developed and evaluated predictive models using not only traditional obstetrical data but also electrophysiological parameters derived from the electrohysterogram (EHG).#R##N#Methods#R##N#EHG recordings were made on singleton term pregnancies. A set of 10 temporal and spectral parameters was calculated to characterize EHG bursts and a further set of 6 common obstetrical parameters was also considered in the predictive models design. Different models were implemented based on single layer Support Vector Machines (SVM) and with aggregation of majority voting of SVM (double layer), to distinguish between the two groups: term spontaneous labor (≤41 weeks of gestation) and IOL late-term labor. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the models were compared.#R##N#Results#R##N#The obstetrical and EHG parameters of the two groups did not show statistically significant differences. The best results of non-contextualized single input parameter SVM models were achieved by the Bishop Score (AUC = 0.65) and GA at recording time (AUC = 0.68) obstetrical parameters. The EHG parameter median frequency, when contextualized with the two obstetrical parameters improved these results, reaching AUC = 0.76. Multiple input SVM obtained AUC = 0.70 for all EHG parameters. Aggregation of majority voting of SVM models using contextualized EHG parameters achieved the best result AUC = 0.93.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#Measuring the electrophysiological uterine condition by means of electrohysterographic recordings yielded a promising clinical decision support system for distinguishing patients that will spontaneously achieve active labor before the end of full term from those who will require late term IOL. The importance of considering these EHG measurements in the patient's individual context was also shown by combining EHG parameters with obstetrical parameters. Clinicians considering elective labor induction would benefit from this technique.","['José Alberola-Rubio', 'J. Garcia-Casado', 'G. Prats-Boluda', 'Y.

100,"Short texts are everywhere in the Web, including messages posted in social media, status messages and blog comments, and uncovering the topics of this type of messages is crucial to a wide range of applications, e.g., context analysis and user characterization. Extracting topics from short text is challenging because of the dependence of conventional methods, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in words co-occurrence, which in short text is rare and make these methods suffer from severe data sparsity. This paper proposes a general framework for topic modeling of short text by creating larger pseudo-document representations from the original documents. In the framework, document components (e.g., words or bigrams) are defined over a metric space, which provides information about the similarity between them. We present two simple, effective and efficient methods that specialize our general framework to create larger pseudo-documents. While the first method considers word co-occurrence to define the metric space, the second relies on distributed word vector representations. The pseudo-documents generated can be given as input to any topic modeling algorithm. Experiments run in seven datasets and compared against state-of-the-art methods for extracting topics by generating pseudo-documents or modifying current topic modeling methods for short text show the methods significantly improve results in terms of normalized pointwise mutual information.

101,"Telecom customer churn data is not publicly available because involving users’ personal privacy. In 2009, the French telecommunications company Orange for knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) competition provides a telecom customer churn data set KDD Cup 09. In order to solve the high dimensional problem of KDD Cup 09, a new feature reduction method is used to explore the influence of different features on the prediction of classification model. In this paper, a new K- local maximum margin feature extraction algorithm (KLMM) is proposed. Through researching on the diversification subspace partition rules, the corresponding potential field structure is constructed. According to the data source in the dimension of scalability, the intrinsic link between data attributes and classification results is revealed. The extracted features can reduce the dimension of the churn prediction in telecom data. The KLMM method adapts auto selection sigma factor to reflect the anisotropy of features. The potential function is used to assess the weights of attributes and find the potential important weight. Experiments and analysis show that the extracted features by KLMM are more likely to find a classification hyperplane which can separate data points of the different classes.","['Long Zhao', 'Qian Gao', 'Xiangjun Dong', 'Aimei Dong', 'Xue Dong']",5417a8b7-8c33-4be2-b070-9c74245de4d6,0,"['265bf84d-94dc-4d9e-a9fc-7903b30d502a', '2813b378-826d-4f1e-85e0-3e168a8f9982', '28952250-2619-4777-a5ee-0937e3d4ff6a', '36e25da8-a035-4bb0-a14e-c494ba4bce7f', '397886c8-522b-475c-af90-769e6ecf3d20', '3a54b9a0-b74c-44ac-95b3-936125fe6cf3', '4fa5acfd-c9e0-4ba2-96a4-dece9db9374a', '50a6718c-4519-4b45-ac39-b11765e162fe', '6a66c2c0-f493-4766-a784-ea57294ce98e', '7a641341-e3bc-49ba-8fdd-4300d0ed84b1', '9777ac48-fe99-42c5-9819-d9c020d20f56', '9c59b6f7-6d19-456e-971b-f2abb280d0f1', 'a57285c0-88b6-4d50-a743-73ff7d3e0e7d', 'b79dbe2f-9413-4e96-a286-d35fe7d625d8', 'c736948a-4bd4-4bc3-9770-34c0537f3b33', 'c76a7922-4396-40ac-a689-dcc7280f4157', 'c84cc033-95fe-43cb-874d-9060b6ce9613', 'e06612c6-aba1-43f4-bb1e-d39b5539eec7', 'f76f2f11-86fb-4850-820b-0bf909cd9417', 'fbadcf69-d854-4b77-a2e0-02a926300b15']",K- local maximum margin feature extraction algorithm for churn prediction in telecom,Cluster Computing,2017
102,"Membrane proteins are underrepresented in structural databases, which has led to a lack of computational tools and the corresponding inappropriate use of tools designed for soluble proteins. For membrane proteins, lipid accessibility is an essential property. Although programs are available for sequence-based prediction of lipid accessibility and structure-based identification of solvent-accessible surface area, the latter does not distinguish between water accessible and lipid accessible residues in membrane proteins. Here we present mp_lipid_acc, the first method to identify lipid accessible residues from the protein structure, implemented in the RosettaMP framework and available as a webserver. Our method uses protein structures transformed in membrane coordinates, for instance from PDBTM or OPM databases, and a defined membrane thickness to classify lipid accessibility of residues. mp_lipid_acc is applicable to both α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins of diverse architectures with or without water-filled pores and uses a concave hull algorithm for surface-residue classification. We further provide a manually curated benchmark dataset that can be used for further method development. We present a novel tool to classify lipid accessibility from the protein structure, which is applicable to proteins of diverse architectures and achieves prediction accuracies of 90% on a manually curated database. mp_lipid_acc is part of the Rosetta software suite, available at #N#                    www.rosettacommons.org#N#                    #N#                  .

103,"In a recent conference paper, we have reported a rhythm transcription method based on a merged-output hidden Markov model (HMM) that explicitly describes the multiple-voice structure of polyphonic music. This model solves a major problem of conventional methods that could not properly describe the nature of multiple voices as in polyrhythmic scores or in the phenomenon of loose synchrony between voices. In this paper we present a complete description of the proposed model and develop an inference technique, which is valid for any merged-output HMMs for which output probabilities depend on past events. We also examine the influence of the architecture and parameters of the method in terms of accuracies of rhythm transcription and voice separation and perform comparative evaluations with six other algorithms. Using MIDI recordings of classical piano pieces, we found that the proposed model outperformed other methods by more than 12 points in the accuracy for polyrhythmic performances and performed almost as good as the best one for non-polyrhythmic performances. This reveals the state-of-the-art methods of rhythm transcription for the first time in the literature. Publicly available source codes are also provided for future comparisons.","['Eita Nakamura', 'Kazuyoshi Yoshii', 'Shigeki Sagayama']",7f5b95d5-e2f0-45d7-bea1-25d1feacebbc,50,"['03c20486-b01e-4895-907a-71c6a1ac501d', '05864886-55d1-4a6f-9835-d34ef6c6db8a', '13936404-3437-4eab-8281-ae35f46b3fc6', '1fe1f661-7f6d-4485-aa1e-00afead8478c', '2efc3b91-cbb4-4182-9630-b60db461d14b', '5b8b92c7-4241-4692-9705-7301ad1f4d33', '5c606f6b-44e0-4048-9c72-ca9a798374b6', '5fd00f57-47b6-4775-8d34-069344c2ca60', '61db5f95-01b4-4638-afbb-04b51ebcc05f', '66bc8117-7b8c-4007-8f69-e3bce906001d', '6f08a185-2eb7-43bb-859c-46a8c1c2e89c', '75ccd4a6-dee8-4232-a5c5-33bd21edae0e', '994b6327-8a6c-48ad-a49f-f9c3fd21e869', 'a5a5b835-8cca-478c-9674-a7d168a99089', 'b718cc8d-5afa-4508-829a-31dc1a5cde1b', 'bd56b30a-5180-4354-96ce-62a08b7969f5', 'c1e2c388-9934-430c-9b96-23878faea878', 'd8bbcc35-9f60-4c55-9f99-e2f45d12d893', 'edc743ae-d9a1-4220-8409-98434b2ff2fa', 'f799c6ad-20f1-4790-a07a-d056dbeb48c8', 'f844bc88-25b1-4412-a71e-03f826316be1']",Rhythm Transcription of Polyphonic Piano Music Based on Merged-Output HMM for Multiple Voices,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",2017
104,"A lot of interest has been risen in the last years on the adaptation of deep neural network (DNN) acoustic models, as the latter become the state-of-art in automatic speech recognition. This work focuses on approaches that allow for rapid and robust adaptation of such models. First, i-vectors are added to the DNN input as speaker-informed features. An informative prior is introduced to i-vector estimation to improve the robustness to limited adaptation data. I-vectors are then combined with a structured adaptive DNN, the multibasis adaptive neural network (MBANN), and the complementarity of these adaptation techniques is investigated. Moreover, i-vectors are used to predict the MBANN transforms, avoiding the initial decoding pass and alignment. These approaches are evaluated on a U.S. English Broadcast News (BN) transcription task with two distinct sets of test data. The first, from the BN task and BN-style Youtube videos, yields test data acoustically matched to the training data, while the second set is from acoustically mismatched Youtube videos of diverse context. The performance gains from these schemes are found to be sensitive to the level of mismatch between training and test sets. The MBANN system combined with i-vector input achieves best performance for BN test sets. The i-vector-based predictive MBANN scheme is proven to be more robust to acoustically mismatched conditions and outperforms the other adaptation schemes in such scenarios.","['Penny Karanasou', 'Chunyang Wu', 'Mark J.

This article attempts to analyse digital competence and the development of information and ICT literacies in relation to academic literacy practices which take place in the learning process in undergraduate studies. Data were collected through completion of self-report questionnaires asking about the writing and reading practices and the process of literacy development in university students. The survey was completed by a sample of 786 students in the School of Education. The data obtained were analysed using the techniques of principal components analysis and discriminant analysis. The results describe the ICT and information literacies in literacy practices of the participants, and their relation to the academic literacy process that takes place at university. The results have allowed us to assess the processes for the development of ICT and information literacies and their relationship to academic literacy. Our study indicates a wide gap between digital competence developed in informal learning contexts and its scarcity in university literacy practices (formal learning settings). In general, Spanish University academic practices do not incorporate ICT and information literacies processes as a part of students' academic literacy. Deficient ICT and informational literacies may lead to difficulties in the professional development of teachers.","['Fernando Guzmán-Simón', 'Eduardo García-Jiménez', 'Isabel López-Cobo']",0776b05b-e547-4b35-ab0c-43c8bc637178,0,"['55e3ca41-9b09-4bca-b788-73f198ad5992', '62730f72-6043-4cd5-9cf5-2957f9bc3ccb', '9d41a770-521d-40c9-9634-d500d469d0ed']",Undergraduate Students’ Perspectives on Digital Competence and Academic Literacy in a Spanish University,Computers in Human Behavior,2017

Here, we demonstrate that they can be extracted from a data distribution represented on a two-dimensional map obtained by Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). In GTM, structurally related molecules are grouped together on the map. Zones of the map preferentially populated by target-specific compounds were delineated, which helped to capture common substructures on the basis of which these compounds were grouped together by GTM. Such privileged structural motifs were identified across three major target superfamilies including proteases, kinases, and G protein coupled receptors. Traditionally, the search for privileged structural motifs focused on scaffolds, whereas motifs were detected here without prior knowledge of compound classification in GTMs. This alternative way of navigating medicinal chemistry space further extends the classical, scaffold...","['Shilva Kayastha', 'Dragos Horvath', 'Erik Gilberg', 'Michael Gütschow', 'Jürgen Bajorath', 'Alexandre Varnek']",34349eb7-c84b-45a3-a0bd-9b9903d87415,0,"['0238c23d-6920-4e0e-ae90-44f2f3c0f98a', '02753eac-1ce8-452a-ac15-903551a9480d', '032cd01c-9e59-4495-bba2-57455e26a567', '1fd14ec7-4d65-458a-99ac-b020971a8140', '2834deb1-eaf2-40c8-899c-fdf2d28e556f', '3b60c948-aaad-4cb1-87e7-1dce9f085ab4', '4935259d-fca4-454d-9128-6dfed1c72357', '5bcbc30d-ec61-45aa-8568-94bcf31ecccb', '9339541e-5fb2-4f01-a22e-c48fb42ae3a6', 'dbfca820-bcf3-4231-9eca-8975c5439a5a', 'dc857655-9b0f-4c91-bcbd-026820aba086', 'dcb9168f-612e-4d8d-8aa3-005cfa470a5b', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6']",Privileged Structural Motif Detection and Analysis Using Generative Topographic Maps,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,2017
107,"In his CAV 2004 paper, Tiwari has proved that, for a class of linear programs over the reals, termination is decidable. And Tiwari has shown that the termination of a linear program P1P1 whose assignment matrix A˜ is not in the Jordan canonical form is equivalent to that of a linear program J1J1, whose assignment matrix A is in the Jordan Canonical Form. In most cases, the method of Tiwari provides only a so-called N  -nonterminating point. In this paper, we propose two new methods to decide whether Program P1P1 terminates or not over the reals. Our methods are based on the construction of a subset of the set NT   of non-terminating points of Program J1J1. Any point in such a subset is a witness to non-termination of Program J1J1. Furthermore, it is shown that Program J1J1 is non-terminating if and only if such a subset is nonempty. In terms of the property, the first method is given to check whether Program J1J1 terminates or not. Different from the existing methods, the point obtained by our first method is a non-terminating point, rather than a N  -nonterminating point. More importantly, such a subset is also proven to be ABˆ-invariant for some positive integer Bˆ. This enables us to check directly the termination of Program J1J1 by verifying the satisfiability of finitely many quantified formulas over the reals. This suggests our second method for checking the termination of Program J1J1.",['Yi Li'],9c519b78-1d53-40ee-932c-ab16c4072d18,0,"['0fabece7-eaba-43cf-aa72-960bd95b47d5', '1877f255-adf4-4c4e-851a-54b95d396f53', '1a65bdd8-712d-4a2d-b247-431c6f94ab37', '22c417f4-1ceb-457c-9476-1699f2f363ef', '32711618-120c-4f28-b61b-42c6242021c9', '92bd1062-bf47-4bb0-8141-04bc3b413792', 'a19314ba-8b56-45b0-b9bb-e5f511229a4e', 'a8750781-f330-4c9a-9d5c-de26838fa9cb', 'ba8f9d3e-e8c7-44a9-9d32-0a67bdaf1e56', 'e8c0e0a0-1f3d-46f0-9713-4ab05cf539ac', 'f2de6a0e-f928-45b5-b5e3-b2d302bbf1e6', 'ffb83836-40a6-4da4-9a41-fd74a80931ba']",Witness to non-termination of linear programs,Theoretical Computer Science,2017

We use the combination of corner cutting  b   -ary subdivision scheme and weighted average of   (b+1)      (  b  +  1  )        -points to construct the proposed family. We demonstrate that the proposed family has smaller complexity and support width and higher continuity than the existing Refine-Smooth subdivision schemes.

In addition, it is observed that the proposed family is suitable for fitting the locally noisy, oscillatory, and irregular data.","['Rabia Hameed', 'Ghulam Mustafa']",3bf1b9bc-cc5d-4e20-b60b-9a2174907aa5,0,"['025d9665-ce67-4f8e-9bfb-f7b94e05d8bb', '1aef9c7a-f742-46a7-8153-d6ec7d08eaf9', '329ebd33-0e28-4863-8378-4039ba3496d6', '4ce7799d-ab51-4974-87f4-1e10c33830f4', '57a8a777-8af7-4d6a-89bd-598fd7c6068d', '5e2badb1-1d38-4047-b283-d3d96e8cf79e', '91d454b5-3078-4d52-aa85-8401c538c19e', '956ab9f7-b1a5-4536-bbd1-2ac54e00164f', 'c315256c-3402-4cc4-8371-3f2d22d73088', 'cff7e522-51d1-4fe2-ac75-ea232a4226c3', 'e5ea7894-3898-4ae0-80e3-a2d643ff7b3b', 'ea2ea235-9948-44c1-8d31-b51f6a8031fa', 'ec291ede-6bba-4d1f-9d20-0b236db30608']",Family of a-point b-ary subdivision schemes with bell-shaped mask,Applied Mathematics and Computation,2017
110,"We present a method for specialising the constraints in constrained Horn clauses with respect to a goal. We use abstract interpretation to compute a model of a query–answer transformed version of a given set of clauses and a goal. The constraints from the model are then used to compute a specialised version of each clause. The effect is to propagate the constraints from the goal top-down and propagate answer constraints bottom-up. The specialisation procedure can be repeated to yield further specialisation. The approach is independent of the abstract domain and the constraint theory underlying the clauses. Experimental results on verification problems show that this is an effective transformation, both in our own verification tools (based on a convex polyhedra analyser) and as a pre-processor to other Horn clause verification tools.","['Bishoksan Kafle', 'John P.

111,"A 3D binary image I can be naturally represented by a combinatorial-algebraic structure called cubical complex and denoted by Q(I), whose basic building blocks are vertices, edges, square faces and cubes. In Gonzalez-Diaz et al. (Discret Appl Math 183:59–77, 2015), we presented a method to “locally repair” Q(I) to obtain a polyhedral complex P(I) (whose basic building blocks are vertices, edges, specific polygons and polyhedra), homotopy equivalent to Q(I), satisfying that its boundary surface is a 2D manifold. P(I) is called a well-composed polyhedral complex over the pictureI. Besides, we developed a new codification system for P(I), encoding geometric information of the cells of P(I) under the form of a 3D grayscale image, and the boundary face relations of the cells of P(I) under the form of a set of structuring elements. In this paper, we build upon (Gonzalez-Diaz et al. 2015) and prove that, to retrieve topological and geometric information of P(I), it is enough to store just one 3D point per polyhedron and hence neither grayscale image nor set of structuring elements are needed. From this “minimal” codification of P(I), we finally present a method to compute the 2-cells in the boundary surface of P(I).","['Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz', 'Maria-Jose Jimenez', 'Belen Medrano']",b847418c-2258-4dd5-aaaa-16f57a763ac6,0,"['01edb214-1bd8-444e-9ff4-751ec52ae953', '031b6872-f89c-4da8-a6c5-1f4004808960', '0a931ea4-80bc-42e6-ac67-c21b3c7c0d12', '14739540-b097-44c8-ae97-f452b4ead88c', '1f6a2425-3efd-43e8-8b79-13b5ea238c02', '24815baf-2067-4fe9-b70d-25f4ae227d4f', '2f4ecb56-3eba-4d54-91ab-74958f58fa65', '398b1d02-20bb-468e-9fac-2d2a40f0eebc', '3bc4a1f3-4ab1-4cab-9755-4f30cf5abb7b', '4e14aeb8-efee-4389-ac2f-4849538c0d63', '551d55c8-b5dd-45bf-93de-741eae3b5621', '6682f12b-3c34-4426-b803-113013c29a53', '780bb240-99b4-47df-84b9-1559166355a5', '941aba3a-4a78-4570-9349-47443a3e27c0', '9dfa9369-ace8-48a6-94f1-64ce5e6c8abb', 'de5874f0-7617-4350-8484-1b50fdc678c1', 'e1b0fe43-4869-4854-98de-3f5436ff63b6']",Efficiently Storing Well-Composed Polyhedral Complexes Computed Over 3D Binary Images,Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision,2017
112,"The main focus of this paper is on the development of reliability measures for a repairable multi-state system which operates under dynamic regimes under the discrete-time hypothesis. The switching process of regimes is governed by a Markov chain, and the functioning process of the system follows another Markov chain with different transition probability matrices under different regimes. In terms of two chains as above, a new Markov chain is constructed to depict the evolution process of the dynamic system. For the regime consideration, some novel reliability indices are essential and firstly introduced in this paper. By means of hierarchical partitions for the new state space, Ion-Channel modeling theory and discrete-time Markov chain, the traditional and novel reliability and availability functions for the system under random regimes are easily obtained with the closed form solutions, such as two types of system reliabilities, two types of system point availabilities, two types of system multiple-point availabilities and the associated system multi-interval availabilities and so on. In addition, some probability distributions of sojourn times we are interested in are discussed and computed here. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the results obtained in the paper.","['Yan Li', 'Lirong Cui', 'Cong Lin']",7a446c1f-1978-4e0c-abc3-ea5347217c07,0,"['02856d4e-a0ff-43ef-be9c-8f3b46c4c720', '03bbe2d5-f8fe-4a0e-9ec7-b3651fcc48f9', '0d2ab43e-15a3-4906-88af-1e9fc3225f39', '32e2e100-5a0a-458d-9174-c99aa838edbc', '7a1e0b59-b63e-40a4-98f2-e7806be0891e', '7e3cfad0-1493-431a-b211-9c013625820c', '7fc785b9-f07c-4b0e-80fd-070140570c01', '81049108-cd83-41f3-8d6f-70d2d24a073c', '85559dae-6825-4df7-bffb-a5da9fde4463', '9f62c32f-3284-415b-b403-d263778026c6', 'a59e86a9-79bc-4a6b-b84f-5e8eaa725e40', 'b29e2074-1af9-4476-b2f3-f0edca45568d', 'c4f93ecd-c40f-4be4-ad39-7fe8b771f981', 'cb4d6a47-fc79-4c83-a10f-c9ec59410a03', 'cb77c8f4-d490-48c9-9c5c-30825e1b280b', 'f0992964-5527-403a-bae6-2588230169fe', 'f12bfb85-cf3b-43f3-abad-e5ca74979a05', 'f8b297a0-ff1f-4cc7-aa76-257ede4cc388']",Modeling and analysis for multi-state systems with discrete-time Markov regime-switching,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,2017
113,"An efficient joint two-dimensional direct current resistivity (DCR) and magnetotelluric (MT) inversion, referred to as WSJointInv2D-MT-DCR, was developed with FORTRAN 95 based on the data space Occam's inversion algorithm. Our joint inversion software can be used to invert just the MT data or the DCR data, or invert both data sets simultaneously to get the electrical resistivity structures. Since both MT and DCR surveys yield the same resistivity structures, the two data types enhance each other leading to a better interpretation. Two synthetic and a real field survey are used here to demonstrate that the joint DCR and MT surveys can help constrain each other to reduce the ambiguities occurring when inverting the DCR or MT alone. The DCR data increases the lateral resolution of the near surface structures while the MT data reveals the deeper structures. When the MT apparent resistivity suffers from the static shift, the DCR apparent resistivity can serve as a replacement for the estimation of the static shift factor using the joint inversion. In addition, we also used these examples to show the efficiency of our joint inversion code. With the availability of our new joint inversion software, we expect the number of joint DCR and MT surveys to increase in the future.","['Puwis Amatyakul', 'Chatchai Vachiratienchai', 'Weerachai Siripunvaraporn']",971b456d-3b9e-4cc8-b76c-95565c08fd66,0,[],WSJointInv2D-MT-DCR: An efficient joint two-dimensional magnetotelluric and direct current resistivity inversion,Computers & Geosciences,2017
114,"Dictionary learning approaches have been widely applied to solve pattern classification problems and have achieved promising performance. However, most of works aim to learn a discriminative synthesis dictionary and sparse coding coefficients for classification. Until recent years, analysis dictionary learning began to attract interest from researchers. In this paper, we present a novel discriminative analysis dictionary learning frame, named Synthesis Linear Classifier based Analysis Dictionary Learning (SLC-ADL). Firstly, we incorporate a synthesis-linear-classifier-based error term into the basic analysis dictionary learning model, whose classification performance is obviously improved by making full use of the label information. Then, we develop an alternating iterative algorithm to solve the new model and obtain closed-form solutions leading to pretty competitive running efficiency. What is more, we design three classification schemes by fully exploiting the synthesis linear classifier. Finally, extensive comparison experiments on scene categorization, object classification, action recognition and face recognition clearly verify the classification performance of the proposed algorithm.","['Jiujun Wang', 'Yanqing Guo', 'Jun Guo', 'Ming Li', 'Xiangwei Kong']",4fd7b2c5-b3d7-4dad-8120-91c11522bb04,0,"['00e17dcb-6e2a-4a45-b89b-00fa7e1ef77e', '0227ca5b-e7f7-4a0b-bf18-f9c22ecf54b4', '04c47f14-8533-41ff-bafd-affc1eb52287', '08a4f425-a9ad-4f6d-9dc0-04864515cf30', '0b9a6094-d4c6-4c7a-8b67-a136fd370754', '17c87b9c-8b46-4ea6-9890-32321ae38f19', '19a84626-b0ef-4d3c-a9a0-28957ff3d93a', '1ec0088a-8b66-4e60-ba8b-cdcd43d6b6db', '23766e86-95fb-45ab-9c79-47a78e1dafa6', '260204cc-9ae1-482b-bf33-1e4dde2d3c5f', '380c9c81-58cf-4ca6-ad04-f56e299ca5a3', '3bad1f87-46e6-4ed3-8f4c-93a46b1fb86b', '4ccab0c8-4733-4e86-9841-4beedff64fe9', '5880d47f-8b99-416d-a743-28d6b49f7ba9', '5cf97da9-9327-42ff-9fa2-8df41d0cec68', '5e8b0e8a-d687-4333-bfe9-73b4c1bebde5', '7236dbb7-f0b2-4e28-bb7c-6de187c32d64', '731db66b-2eef-4c87-9284-34fdcd14b295', '7909d2df-bef4-490d-bd45-fe2fecb6cec4', '7b11227f-6886-434b-90c3-100bc89120fa', '7ca35a30-f496-490d-bf55-c3f1abf99178', '7cfb57dc-30a2-46f3-baab-7748e7b62a1c', '82eeac98-56cd-4d68-97a3-7abb7c3452e4', '8641b4ee-59c1-494d-adb3-b6d1919bbbac', '93ba227a-1dd2-4c5d-891c-5d93779c3eb7', '97b001e0-ef8a-4c49-8bd6-3dd8b50b46f3', '9a281963-feb8-44a4-94e7-a378e29f6632', '9a4a195d-9502-4943-998a-c24901a65163', 'a16be773-78d1-432b-8f57-f9781b92f491', 'a866200f-b4ed-4f38-86d5-bd55ba2d0591', 'a94f889d-abce-46b7-9d65-d877585da0b6', 'af3ef251-05e3-4065-b489-9d76910adce9', 'b0606ea9-ade8-47dd-bf8b-b720a5af6424', 'ba9df238-082d-4e6c-bcbe-01eebd1cbed6', 'c1255f60-5013-48aa-8b16-d4d2fe913941', 'c1ceaf9b-605d-46a7-a9a0-2135cb856f3f', 'c3a983e1-f002-4313-95db-46f4a641bf06', 'c9482f1f-6600-44a7-a69a-e63ef13cdff8', 'cf8ede63-496b-4335-a910-e95dbd0aa70b', 'd4fcfc3b-c7e2-4580-99b2-abadd8be6760', 'd868e809-1ed0-467f-b909-6a7131d79ca9', 'e0ac4812-7729-4a2d-8a1f-74b1b7c8eb5d', 'e2472011-1a31-40d8-ba98-302d7965b9d3', 'e752ace3-2161-4948-8443-d504de19c859', 'ec365bcf-2ce7-422f-a60e-26e8e8e0241d', 'ec41b998-c0c4-45cb-9062-5c84e06c37ca']",Synthesis linear classifier based analysis dictionary learning for pattern classification,Neurocomputing,2017
115,"Moves towards providing a common benchmarks in different network environments have recently been undertaken. Such suites define network topologies, simulation scenarios i.e. traffic characteristics, as well as the evaluation parameters. Determining the essential parameters of a simulation environment enables comparison of new enhancements under comparable conditions. The next-generation wireless technology - WiMAX is designed to enable high-speed, mobile Internet access to the wide array of devices. It delivers low-cost, open networks as well as a solution for the efficient transmission with QoS (Quality of Service) support, at the Media Access Control (MAC) layer for guaranteeing multimedia transmissions. One of the most important part of this architecture is the scheduling algorithm which determines the available resource allocation. The paper aims at proposing recommendations for a common WiMAX evaluation suite. The authors point out the particular aspects of WiMAX technologies that may influence the overall network performance. The basic WiMAX topologies are suggested as well as the traffic scenarios and the evaluation parameters. We also introduce a solution that allows using a real-world, proprietary scheduler algorithm implementation in the ns-2 simulator.","['Lukasz Chrost', 'Agnieszka Brachman']",bbe542c5-4420-449d-9d00-13a0ae26c56f,50,"['386a49a9-d157-4e11-b4a7-18535c14cb94', '4d0f2c57-7f08-416a-9721-eb333c88433e', '5e928530-23e3-4e03-b365-43aa09647e35', '724ca892-6105-4573-b91f-787c2a78c52a', '8fb93805-59c3-4c46-b718-43990ead16f0', 'ac6be59b-2003-4d2a-9efb-9fd82389d126', 'bbef7ada-a4e7-4512-a37a-2fda7fdf6bf3', 'c1b82669-b1b7-4622-893e-6936502729fb', 'd59bd56d-4492-442a-a8e4-a82720908421', 'e28024f0-1378-44c9-a119-e4a674e0b80b', 'ef47275d-8051-4d65-9b87-9337bbc2ad0b']",Towards a common benchmark in WiMAX environment,Computer Communications,2010
116,"With the rising popularity of social media in the context of environments based on the Internet of things (IoT), semantic information has emerged as an important bridge to connect human intelligence with heterogeneous media big data. As a critical tool to improve media big data retrieval, semantic fusion encounters a number of challenges: the manual method is inefficient, and the automatic approach is inaccurate. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a solution called CSF (Crowdsourcing Semantic Fusion) that makes full use of the collective wisdom of social users and introduces crowdsourcing computing to semantic fusion. First, the correlation of cross-modal semantics is mined and the semantic objects are normalized for fusion. Second, we employ the dimension reduction and relevance feedback approaches to reduce non-principal components and noise. Finally, we research the storage and distribution mechanism. Experiment results highlight the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach. The proposed method is an effective and practical cross-modal semantic fusion and distribution mechanism for heterogeneous social media, provides a novel idea for social media semantic processing, and uses an interactive visualization framework for social media knowledge mining and retrieval to improve semantic knowledge and the effect of representation.","['Kehua Guo', 'Yayuan Tang', 'Peiyun Zhang']",111c8333-6896-4bed-95df-7bd1115b7225,0,"['02168f4a-7004-434b-9efc-c8987eba0eee', '3019a7dc-cf07-4e98-9e96-b4b0bacbb1a2', '3c1038c4-49dd-415a-8bda-43d1dab4693b', '4db01622-64ce-4bdf-ab44-d03267ed355e', '508a4816-b928-4158-b92b-24fc89706e27', '521c30a1-a18e-42aa-b672-92d67098307e', '5c92403f-fb15-440e-a55f-10efba37d3dc', '5e10d054-8376-4d02-8f82-d7f3b974fde3', '6ef2b150-1723-47cb-bff1-6ceafa71c755', '71e1fe83-4eb1-422c-805f-657e13370aee', '793610d6-06ee-47f0-a04e-6ba3b3acf923', '83c192ea-5047-4c26-b4f5-7576840edcc1', '8af707f4-6689-4b8f-b655-00e48369272d', '8afe8e20-e859-4afc-aae9-cb516d5eea6a', '8b1dcedf-79e9-4ca4-bdd9-41d47e50a388', '96e60bbe-5cc9-4476-b05f-6268a53b7595', 'a931cd63-c360-423a-9888-ebe093b5ab61', 'b4bdfa8b-694c-4724-a7ea-5d9a04c78362', 'ba7b3aa9-75bb-439f-bb7d-5e9bc4919f9a', 'bea5955a-3c8e-44a5-b4c9-b7092434c6a7', 'cc21484e-9713-4996-be7d-f2810a3f6774', 'd69374c1-bf6b-4474-8290-224d22323ab4', 'de4a858c-dbc0-482b-9c5f-9784354a789c', 'ede97388-caa9-4456-9cff-d5d8487782be', 'f9beb650-57aa-4714-9232-1783f2f23f0d']",CSF: Crowdsourcing semantic fusion for heterogeneous media big data in the internet of things,Information Fusion,2017
117,"Point set registration (PSR) is the process of computing a spatial transformation that optimally aligns pairs of point sets. The method helps to amalgamate multiple datasets into a common coordinate system. Because of their immense practical applications, several studies have attempted to address challenges inherent in the PSR problem. However, limited works exist to discuss recent developments, failures, and trends of the PSR methods. To date, a classical work of Tam et al., published in 2013, can be regarded as a comprehensive review paper for registration methods. Nevertheless, this work has inadequately revealed a range of possible knowledge gaps of the previous studies. Additionally, since the publication year of their work, more superior and state-of-the-art methods have been proposed. The present study surveys PSR approaches until 2017, and our primary focus is to expose central ideas and limitations of the methods to facilitate experts and practitioners advance the field.","['Baraka Jacob Maiseli', 'Yanfeng Gu', 'Huijun Gao']",0166165f-e6dc-466b-adc8-37616f662f4c,0,"['0482b3cd-b4e8-43a0-9413-c4d31cbfdca5', '066b7163-df17-4e0c-9590-394318317d11', '078a174b-6bf3-4009-9951-0ee8d1cb27b4', '07e6873b-fe7e-4b3d-a03e-77a2df48f6c1', '0cc6d895-b589-4657-b78a-df2d8e94e9ee', '0e859ce5-0605-4a79-a08d-09e513149b9c', '0f93889b-6de5-4bb3-a3f6-c51c81289674', '10d6b9bb-e608-4eba-9159-63ebae79ad5f', '177818d7-5151-4513-a322-72d669e1a744', '18d676c5-2adb-4f87-bf8a-5384dbdc8a4e', '1a8d7c1a-9af3-4fdf-8d26-a660671067c8', '1be06b6f-e1aa-426b-9ee1-0d28fd210e5f', '1d611d14-da01-469d-be1a-1fa7b04b0b54', '1fc2831f-0de0-483c-833a-07cb13e20309', '21eb373c-5dd9-4209-acbc-282141e666a3', '239feef1-9d86-4517-b505-ed8f96706f2c', '23d3d1f2-a630-479b-9f8a-6b080bb039fe', '2724bf18-b26b-4ae5-af25-543e0963c024', '27d80fa7-6ece-4534-9da5-bd7a34db10aa', '2a43ef5d-014e-45c1-be66-19d79df69837', '2dd37ba8-480b-4490-aaad-fac691048b27', '2ec97eb0-e4d1-40af-9fc9-3457e401fb80', '31a44b19-f4c7-447e-93be-76032623fe4e', '31d3dcad-0122-42dd-845d-01c7a44c22a0', '33270b49-e826-404b-a03b-f75547f44141', '3430815f-feeb-4b17-862c-be1acdefca88', '3a347f4f-ec58-44a3-87ff-a3bfee09cb78', '3b55da98-d445-4eff-a5a6-51b1bcdf3b5b', '455ea429-ceb9-4791-ae11-3b95f555bb22', '46c9697b-cf1a-4101-9943-c8d239c90877', '492a0e6b-649b-4063-8255-224fb5ce425d', '4b222616-1498-4af3-98d5-695f25e8d513', '4c402bc4-7d15-409a-ad67-282cfee4d3e6', '4d2b0676-a2ca-492a-b7e5-0901c27aae01', '4dc16fbb-125f-4e0a-9eed-215d8ddd9ff2', '4e8eada5-ec33-4208-8a17-fa7aa526321d', '50f67f82-42e0-42cf-a595-edb2242abd32', '511e7a06-e886-4690-99a3-dd31fe29a5d2', '590476dc-e34f-4e1b-ba3c-e83a17773cae', '59ddd5df-c819-4d15-927d-30e5f31a3a7b', '5a7acb2d-f29a-44b8-8772-d6621eb995d8', '5c486eed-2a4f-4e0e-aa2c-124c3c002f8d', '5f47b517-28bf-4c66-b20a-7eb9837a15c0', '6467824f-aab2-4173-8650-102af272b3de', '6591ed89-b54f-40fd-bfad-715b7705200e', '6e0d7a60-4787-4348-84a5-5b94664a5777', '702bc53c-143a-4943-878e-f3b73480b8ac', '74bb3d70-04bf-466f-95ef-b4f38f56179b', '75a09a95-108c-4209-b7fd-10c88506410c', '7c17275e-2379-4fe9-89e8-089b50f94663', '7dacb953-c993-4b6a-9dc3-0ef785aa55ee', '7dc67ca4-a33e-4dfd-b900-ad75bd1a08e8', '7e490236-e784-44e3-8fcf-e7ce76a88da8', '7fc7c893-2569-4e42-a557-f4ee6ff0eba1', '80e985b7-e4c3-4662-bf47-896043cac37f', '80f98543-85a6-4e74-8a91-d930bd543a4f', '818f9f9e-f491-472f-8e76-4a41c0b3c134', '88f85c71-d474-4d12-9c74-43ac3b7c7ee6', '8a77183b-e381-40da-89e0-83bbca5048e8', '8a7f89dc-34c9-4afd-9252-c58f622f7f5b', '9414d52f-ee38-475b-b197-a057b8bdd438', '946d2d80-109b-4093-8042-8268a05373fc', 'a09ad9e6-6249-4d48-ad4d-5dd959777e9e', 'a1357979-16a2-4c4f-afd0-00e62ecadc7c', 'a38c9ad4-6192-4609-991e-77fc98bd9a2d', 'a675eda2-736c-4a7b-8498-a3632df10260', 'a7a01782-8e14-4dd6-9336-60718abbfc0b', 'ae2402ad-123c-4f7b-a0b1-6085d5e85f60', 'b592576f-ff29-4a68-9b2f-8a8ad02e9c70', 'b5ceb5d8-a469-461d-9da2-3be39b53f1c7', 'b5d35eb4-ef73-4644-bf91-908bd755374e', 'b6384e77-1e53-4943-a091-0a2600d94f3c', 'b6f86225-a389-4eec-89c8-1f654c584865', 'ba4f1f0c-eae2-49aa-bc19-c6076608b101', 'bcfeac7d-9007-41e0-b12d-d734fa7ea858', 'bf1120c3-e66c-48cd-9731-620852fa2321', 'c1e9ee00-1f45-4857-b748-4651fe741741', 'c37b853e-4786-44d9-9068-ed08fafe22ae', 'c54022da-8fbd-42c9-a194-ff4c00e5d708', 'c82512db-c28a-4358-8648-abf48c72ea7c', 'c9d3ce58-dead-4827-b24b-73a27f3a6839', 'cb3753ff-e38c-4519-a659-7c17f942b142', 'cf209267-fcac-44b8-adac-9bb8c5f28313', 'd011086d-e1d2-46a8-9d7a-cf87a6708139', 'd0dde44b-4599-46e6-a362-da273f7c4408', 'd1c5cd6d-8727-46a6-b4d6-6ac24b478403', 'd3b1d34a-eaf1-4272-a9de-0c07d09fd99d', 'd4510a9c-be98-436b-b905-ced5fbbf0568', 'd6ed5c03-7304-4daa-a2e9-c0352ae8c818', 'd81479a0-66a2-4080-bb0a-27894bd05a75', 'da0cb1ae-b8b4-41c3-8456-73655865507e', 'e1945420-ed5c-4080-bec5-3658ff49eafa', 'e3712ce1-d460-429b-947e-e08eb80bb967', 'e42ce5f1-2b8b-4fdc-bc4a-13be920870dd', 'e487efc4-9999-47a4-b08d-43cc0694bcbf', 'e553e073-cb33-44ba-aeb8-6253572b614b', 'e671d5f0-ad20-46da-b38e-050afe4bd9e5', 'ea6f9ae2-8c97-4a0c-8b92-55ba0ed3cb3c', 'eab2140f-464f-4d3f-a664-1a546dbcf811', 'ecec0e48-3e0e-4502-993c-e67a92dea1e2', 'ed2bdeaa-8014-4738-a18a-a58de8e0201e', 'edd487fa-1b08-48e3-8cc5-441a3f0ba6d4', 'eeff6c40-31cc-4d3c-b570-2060982d86c0', 'f204a601-a69b-4785-b024-544b04111c5c', 'f4ec5207-1b7c-4990-9cbd-64b752b41524', 'f6376a8f-0cdd-4a55-98c4-a2dbe0a0301a', 'f6e6401d-663b-4117-a701-96e73db3fb74', 'fcb484de-0507-429a-9ecd-aa6c3fb919d3', 'fd4c27c9-7ece-4f02-ab55-f48d8a232fb1']",Recent developments and trends in point set registration methods,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017

The goal of the course is to teach third-year Bachelor students how to apply the abstract knowledge gathered in the theoretical courses (control theory, communication theory, software, and hardware) to the design of a complex and real engineering project. Based on their progress during the academic year, we illustrate how standards can be used to teach a broad skill set and act as an accelerator to abstract system implementation complexity.

121,"Copper-clad laminate (CCL), the key material for printed circuit board production, is used in various electronic products; thereby, the demand for CCL is on the rise. The process of CCL manufacturing occurs in three phases: treating, lay-up, and pressing, while the process with the largest influence on quality control is the treating. For effective quality control, the treating process requires intermediate inspection for three important quality factors: treated weight, minimum viscosity, and gel time. However, a manual inspection, which present-day manufacturers perform, incurs heavy cost in terms of time and money, rendering it ineffective. This study proposes the application of virtual metrology for CCL manufacturing to predict product quality derived from processing data without a product quality inspection. The actual process data from a CCL manufacturer in Korea was collected for a duration of approximately 5 months. Based on these data, the application builds a prediction model for CCL quality by utilizing the process variables affecting the CCL quality as predictor variables. As a result, four regression algorithms and three methods of variable selection were applied to build the prediction models for virtual metrology. Prediction models were obtained with a high accuracy in specific target variables. It was also verified that quality control was influenced by not only the important predictor variables empirically recognized by process engineers in the field but also by several essential variables previously unknown to the engineers; effective quality control will be possible by focusing on these variables particularly and more efficiently instead of overall monitoring.","['Misuk Kim', 'Seokho Kang', 'Jehyuk Lee', 'Hyunchang Cho', 'Sungzoon Cho', 'Jee Su Park']",ff056c06-383e-40b8-8d2b-d392fe0e7a11,0,"['00c5269c-8271-473d-b02f-2b3545963d70', '181ab3ad-f5ad-4a14-86d1-87e8c40768a5', '36c7d295-c679-4340-ae39-63cdb9c96fba', '4294d728-d4cc-4480-94fc-729068d0a31a', '4eab381b-c177-4158-a45d-7d1c66757264', '57f3aa7f-3fab-433c-9086-9a6a911f26a8', '70f06493-e955-4a85-80de-e3427184d2af', '7325919d-7b02-43eb-9df1-5060d247c179', '931ff750-97f7-48e5-afb4-64f659a0cb8f', '9ca9fd21-1ea5-4fac-b5d3-ef24b0aea2c3', 'a732e4e8-3ab0-4b97-82f6-c06a5c0389ca', 'ae3dcd2c-7c6c-42c0-b936-37e210c8be47', 'bcbe548e-cb4b-4a2d-b88d-a3594fd8fa4e', 'e69f3e47-d0e0-4a7f-9cc0-edaea8f043c4', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6']",Virtual Metrology for Copper-Clad Laminate Manufacturing,Computers & Industrial Engineering,2017
122,"In this research, we unpack how interdependencies affect not just individual dyads but also value creation across an alliance portfolio and ultimately a focal firm’s performance. Moving beyond the collection of dyadic relationships of individual alliances, we examine more holistically the distribution of power imbalances and mutual dependences within alliance portfolios, as well as the impact of redundancies in portfolio partners’ resources. Building on resource dependence theory, we develop and test arguments on a sample of 59 firms in the U.S. passenger airline industry during 1998–2011. We find that nonuniform distributions of power imbalances and mutual dependences within the alliance portfolio as well as redundancy affect firm performance in different ways, which has implications for the management of alliance portfolios.","['Manuela N.

123,"The third generation PacBio SMRT long reads can effectively address the read length issue of the second generation sequencing technology, but contain approximately 15% sequencing errors. Several error correction algorithms have been designed to efficiently reduce the error rate to 1%, but they discard large amounts of uncorrected bases and thus lead to low throughput. This loss of bases could limit the completeness of downstream assemblies and the accuracy of analysis. Here, we introduce HALC, a high throughput algorithm for long read error correction. HALC aligns the long reads to short read contigs from the same species with a relatively low identity requirement so that a long read region can be aligned to at least one contig region, including its true genome region’s repeats in the contigs sufficiently similar to it (similar repeat based alignment approach). It then constructs a contig graph and, for each long read, references the other long reads’ alignments to find the most accurate alignment and correct it with the aligned contig regions (long read support based validation approach). Even though some long read regions without the true genome regions in the contigs are corrected with their repeats, this approach makes it possible to further refine these long read regions with the initial insufficient short reads and correct the uncorrected regions in between. In our performance tests on E. coli, A. thaliana and Maylandia zebra data sets, HALC was able to obtain 6.7-41.1% higher throughput than the existing algorithms while maintaining comparable accuracy. The HALC corrected long reads can thus result in 11.4-60.7% longer assembled contigs than the existing algorithms.

124,"A nonlinear random walk related to the porous medium equation (nonlinear Fokker–Planck equation) is investigated. This random walk is such that when the number of steps is sufficiently large, the probability of finding the walker in a certain position after taking a determined number of steps approximates to a q-Gaussian distribution (     G  q , β    ( x )  ∝   [ 1 −  ( 1 − q )  β  x 2  ]   1 / ( 1 − q )      ), which is a solution of the porous medium equation. This can be seen as a verification of a generalized central limit theorem where the attractor is a q-Gaussian distribution, reducing to the Gaussian one when the linearity is recovered (    q → 1    ). In addition, motivated by this random walk, a nonlinear Markov chain is suggested.","['R. S. Mendes', 'Ervin Kaminski Lenzi', 'L. C. Malacarne', 'S.

125,"Recent studies have shown that image representations built upon deep convolutional layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have strong discriminative characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel and effective method to create compact binary codes (deep binary codes) based on deep convolutional features for image retrieval. Deep binary codes are generated by comparing the response from each feature map and the average response across all the feature maps on the deep convolutional layers. Additionally, a spatial cross-summing strategy is proposed to directly generate bit-scalable binary codes. As the deep binary codes on different deep layers can be obtained by passing the image through the CNN and each of them makes a different contribution to the search accuracy, we then present a dynamic, on-the-fly late fusion approach where the top  N  high quality search scores from deep binary codes are automatically determined online and fused to further enhance the retrieval precision. Two strengths of the proposed methods are that the generation of deep binary codes is based on a generic model, which does not require additional training for new image domains, and that the dynamic late fusion scheme is query adaptive. Extensive experimental results on well known benchmarks show that the performance of deep binary codes are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches for large scale image retrieval. Moreover, it is shown that the dynamic late fusion scheme significantly enhances the search accuracy.","['Song Wu', 'Ard Oerlemans', 'Erwin M. Bakker', 'Michael S.

126,"Abstract  Objectives  Health information seeking on behalf of others is an important form of social support by which laypeople provide important sources of information for patients. Based on social network theory, we analyze whether this phenomenon also occurs in offline sources. We also seek to learn more about the type of relationships between information seekers and patients, as research to date indicates that surrogate seeking mostly occurs in close relationships between the seeker and the patient.  Methods  Using a large-scale representative survey from the 28 member states of the European Union ( N =26,566), our data comprise all respondents who reported seeking health information online or offline ( n =18,750; 70.6%).  Results  Within the past year, 61.0% of the online health information seekers and 61.1% of the offline health information seekers had searched on behalf of someone else. Independent of the information channel, surrogate seekers primarily searched for health information for family members (online: 89.8%; offline: 92.8%); they were significantly less likely to search for information on behalf of someone with whom they had weaker ties, such as colleagues (online: 25.1%; offline: 24.4%). In a multilevel generalized linear model, living together with someone was by far the most relevant determinant for surrogate seeking, with differences between countries or Internet activity being less important.  Conclusion  These results support the assumptions of social network theory. Implications are discussed, especially with regard to the provision of adequate health information.","['Doreen Reifegerste', 'Marko Bachl', 'Eva Baumann']",94ab6c7b-9851-4ab6-bf13-783bd5e74580,0,"['12db5c05-5979-4793-b4a0-8cfd02639bec', '3025faa2-c3eb-4e97-beab-105f8eabe858', '3a16357e-12ac-4cb7-a42d-ea57bb16b295', '6916e934-960f-49af-9dab-1e8d72546b30', '7d370176-bf43-4d2b-b39a-94ea0ce0176d']",Surrogate health information seeking in Europe: Influence of source type and social network variables,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2017
127,"An exponential growth in data demand on wireless networks and wireless link capacity approaching its theoretical limits, bound us to find new solutions and innovative network designs to handle the enormous amount of traffic. In this paper, we discuss long term evolution-advance (LTE-A) heterogeneous networks (HetNets) being a most effective solution to break this wireless cellular capacity crunch. LTE-A HetNets provide adequate increase in capacity by utilizing multi-tier architecture consisting of different type of cells i.e macro cell, small cell, relay and device to device. However this increase in capacity comes with certain challenges in HetNets outlined in this article. Considering inter cell interference coordination (ICIC) as biggest challenge in LTE-A HetNets, this article surveys state of the art LTE-A HetNets deployments with focus on ICIC.

128,"New media researchers have shown that Facebook use and norms of online communicative behaviors can affect people's social network formation and self-perceived social capital. Presumably, individual users vary in perceiving Facebook content posted by others, which may influence the number of working communication features enabled by Facebook. This study thus examines whether perceived content desirability and Facebook-enabled communication practices matter for furthering social capital via Facebook. Specifically, this article examines certain types of Facebook content, including information sharing, self-presentation, and opinion expression. It contends that the three kinds of contents have varying impact on Facebook-specific bridging and bonding social capital through Facebook-enabled communication practices. Analysis of a survey of university students in Hong Kong (N = 406) shows that respondents perceiving high desirability of Facebook contents tend to more actively use Facebook-enabled communicative features than those who do not. The use of technical features, in turn, affects bridging and bonding social capital via Facebook. The analysis thus demonstrates how perceived content desirability can indirectly impact individual-level online social capital.","['Chris Chao Su', 'Ngai Keung Chan']",55737cdd-e9f7-4a90-96b6-20b75d74451f,0,"['03815bcc-5da0-46d8-bf06-c1e35eb62156', '0d3ddc81-b0e9-401a-96ab-cf4bed7db6f5', '22fa44c0-7f2b-422e-9937-584318a9d667', '23263893-0b31-41c3-8b87-5f6609bc45ca', '27b244fc-58fb-46c6-bfc4-406889aaf655', '2fcadf46-5421-4ee2-a351-d9360c145252', '3b1cc80b-1ffb-4798-bc94-682245042d65', '42a5ea44-9f86-45ae-aad5-7ea0417c5026', '55de1558-9db6-4bb7-9462-eb0df8c757c8', '583dbacd-dbf6-45b0-84e1-83ed1c8c77fd', '64b18b08-51e7-4ddc-8029-d8aa56484193', '74d99702-3ce7-4a35-b74b-b83a295b283e', '8a3071d5-a9af-4bec-bdc7-3f49615ac28c', '91b61748-ff99-4095-971f-096f363a96aa', 'ac744614-9003-4ccb-93bf-2fe5b1ef4166', 'b573b60e-aa27-4170-87c8-20446840dbad', 'd5a98da3-c009-4fa9-a89e-259077f8fe91', 'e00a1f2b-e456-4402-a54f-d3dfda8ccd93', 'f3f293a8-59ef-4e1f-ad07-3170c41c0f8c', 'f7fb89fc-d03d-49fd-a7a3-c3b7e0f440c4']","Predicting social capital on Facebook: The implications of use intensity, perceived content desirability, and Facebook-enabled communication practices",Computers in Human Behavior,2017
129,"The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes have been extensively employed for the simulation of complex flow fields due to their high order accuracy and good shock-capturing properties. However, the standard finite difference WENO scheme cannot hold freestream automatically in general curvilinear coordinates. Numerical errors from non-preserved freestream can hide small scales such as turbulent flow structures; aero-acoustic waves which can make the results inaccurate or even cause the simulation failure. To address this issue, a new numerical strategy to ensure freestream preservation properties of the WENO schemes on stationary curvilinear grids is proposed in this paper. The essential idea of this approach is to offset the geometrically induced errors by proper discretization of the metric invariants. It includes the following procedures: (1) the metric invariants are retained in the governing equations and the full forms of the transformed equations on the general curvilinear coordinates are solved; (2) the symmetrical, conservative form of the metrics instead of the original ones are used; (3) the WENO schemes which are applied for the inviscid fluxes of the governing equations are employed to compute the outer-level partial derivatives of the metric invariants. In other words, the outer-level derivative operators for the metric invariants are kept the same with those for the corresponding inviscid fluxes. It is verified theoretically in this paper that by using this approach, the WENO schemes hold the freestream preservation properties naturally and thus work well in the generalized coordinate systems. For some well-known WENO schemes, the derivative operators for the metric invariants are explicitly expressed and thus this approach can be straightforwardly employed. The effectiveness of this strategy is validated by several benchmark test cases.","['Yujie Zhu', 'Zhen-Sheng Sun', 'Yu-Xin Ren', 'Yu Hu', 'Shi-Ying Zhang']",20a71089-a41d-4f1c-839b-f90a6ef0f9f5,0,"['5a84e7c5-8ae4-4d70-b22d-7b3fd147d000', '77da4789-598f-405a-885d-6cc4fe050507', '8058e98c-bab8-440f-a8b7-6806d06275a1', '836fc68c-1f3c-406a-a554-59521343e57a', '873817a7-56e1-42a8-8468-172d553c847f', '9b423f29-09ff-4455-a344-6715586052af', 'b6d24f2f-5b00-4a3c-a295-b8d9bad523c9', 'f4cac4e7-2325-4520-8d04-aa402db622ef']",A Numerical Strategy for Freestream Preservation of the High Order Weighted Essentially Non-oscillatory Schemes on Stationary Curvilinear Grids,Journal of Scientific Computing,2017

131,"This paper shows a multi-objectives mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model for a petrochemical supply chain under uncertainty environments, namely disruption risks and less knowledge of parameters. In this model, two efficient queuing systems are applied in nylon plastic manufacturing and recycling centers, in which a Jackson network is also used. The aims are to minimize the average tardiness to deliver products, total cost and transportation cost. In addition the developed model specifies the optimal locations for a new distribution center (DC), collection center and disposal center as well as the optimal allocation of customer zones to each DC. This model is solved in three stages: (1) a Jackson network determines the queuing parameters, (2) an Lp-metric approach makes the multi-objectives into a single objective, and (3) an efficient Lagrangian relaxation based on a sub-gradient approach solves the presented model.

133,"Large-scale streaming URLs are the norm in many commercial software products that aim to filter URLs based on their sensitivity or risk level. In such problem scenarios, filtering is typically done by classifying a URL using either its webpage content or certain additional contextual information. However, such approaches are slow and computationally expensive, as they require gathering and processing webpage content or other contextual information for each URL. In this work, the authors propose a method for classifying URLs in large-scale streaming environments that doesn't suffer from these drawbacks. The proposed method is based on online ensemble learning, which results in lightweight prediction models that are well-suited for classification of streaming datasets. The authors illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using large-scale datasets from a live, production environment and show that the proposed method results in an increase of 5 to 8 percent in terms of precision and 3 to 5.5 percent in terms of recall.","['Neetu Singh', 'Narendra S.

134,"Background#R##N#Flight anxiety and the fear-related avoidance draw serious personal and financial negative consequences. Although classical exposure techniques for flight anxiety are widely used, they involve significant limits. Efforts to develop the benefits and access to evidence-based psychotherapies have led to a new method of delivering exposure technique, namely virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). Until now, there has been no meta-analysis which assumed as a primary objective the analysis of VRET effectiveness in flight anxiety.#R##N#Methods#R##N#The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of VRET interventions for flight anxiety compared to various control conditions, at post-test and follow-up. We conducted a quantitative review of 11 randomized studies, we examined potential moderators of the efficacy of interventions and we investigated the presence and the degree of publication bias.#R##N#Results#R##N#Results pointed out significant overall efficiency of VRET in flight anxiety at post-test and follow-up. Analysis highlighted the superiority of VRET vs. control conditions at post-test and follow-up and the superiority of VRET vs. classical evidence-based interventions at post-test and follow-up. Results revealed similar efficacy between VRET and exposure based interventions at post-test, and showed better treatment gains over time when using VRET vs. exposure based interventions. Moderation analyses revealed that low quality trials, with smaller and younger samples led to a larger effect size of VRET for flight anxiety. Also, outcome types, the number of exposure sessions and follow-up intervals were significant moderators of the efficiency of VRET in this disorder.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#The present meta-analysis supports the efficiency of VRET in flight anxiety and encourages the use of this type of exposure both in clinical practice and research field.","['Roxana Cardos', 'Oana David', 'Daniel David']",eb69acf1-45d3-4f0b-842e-9e7ae6569c7e,0,"['3972a017-4d9d-43f4-9d5e-806c40811c04', '7e6a9ea4-29c9-4bd6-9f8c-2441a59fec57', '9a8896f5-c74c-4821-ae09-361b4e026dc3', '9fcabdda-c183-4f89-bad0-dde4a1d7f82f', 'a4788d45-b7f2-49a2-ae66-98db85093c5e']",Virtual reality exposure therapy in flight anxiety: A quantitative meta-analysis,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
135,"Finger-vein biometrics has been extensively investigated for personal verification. Despite recent advances in finger-vein verification, current solutions completely depend on domain knowledge and still lack the robustness to extract finger-vein features from raw images. This paper proposes a deep learning model to extract and recover vein features using limited  a priori  knowledge. First, based on a combination of the known state-of-the-art handcrafted finger-vein image segmentation techniques, we automatically identify two regions: a clear region with high separability between finger-vein patterns and background, and an ambiguous region with low separability between them. The first is associated with pixels on which all the above-mentioned segmentation techniques assign the same segmentation label (either foreground or background), while the second corresponds to all the remaining pixels. This scheme is used to automatically discard the ambiguous region and to label the pixels of the clear region as foreground or background. A training data set is constructed based on the patches centered on the labeled pixels. Second, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on the resulting data set to predict the probability of each pixel of being foreground (i.e., vein pixel), given a patch centered on it. The CNN learns what a finger-vein pattern is by learning the difference between vein patterns and background ones. The pixels in any region of a test image can then be classified effectively. Third, we propose another new and original contribution by developing and investigating a fully convolutional network to recover missing finger-vein patterns in the segmented image. The experimental results on two public finger-vein databases show a significant improvement in terms of finger-vein verification accuracy.","['Huafeng Qin', 'Mounîm A.

136,"This paper proposes a continuous time irrational filter structure via a set of the fractional order Gammatone components instead of via a set of integer order Gammatone components. The filter design problem is formulated as a nonsmooth and nonconvex infinite constrained optimization problem. The nonsmooth function is approximated by a smooth operator. The domain of the constraint functions is sampled into a set of finite discrete points so the infinite constrained optimization problem is approximated by a finite constrained optimization problem. To find a near globally optimal solution, the norm relaxed sequential quadratic programming approach is applied to find the locally optimal solutions of this nonconvex optimization problem. The current or the previous locally optimal solutions are kicked out by adding the random vectors to them. The locally optimal solutions with the lower objective functional values are retained and the locally optimal solutions with the higher objective functional values are discarded. By iterating the above procedures, a near globally optimal solution is found. The designed filter is applied to perform the denoising. It is found that the signal to noise ratio of the designed filter is higher than those of the filters designed by the conventional gradient descent approach and the genetic algorithm method, while the required computational power of our proposed method is lower than those of the conventional gradient descent approach and the genetic algorithm method. Also, the signal to noise ratio of the filter with the fractional order Gammatone components is higher than those of the filter with the integer order Gammatone components and the conventional rational infinite impulse response filters.","['Xiao-Zhi Zhang', 'Bingo Wing-Kuen Ling', 'Cairong Li', 'Nixon Cheuk Ming Leung']",04435799-5a87-4f86-8948-8ea7540b364d,0,"['0779fd2b-9ea8-4635-ac8b-8717ba97b273', '0cf0c07f-5fc7-455f-b68e-2107104f335e', '0d93a9ec-25f2-4085-81e5-487edc24ea12', '1808ad07-ec9f-4194-a285-21d9f52f97d4', '5d14af60-07b6-4f33-85f0-474c6ecc9f27', '62d566a6-f16f-46d6-af57-85e7794ca9be', '644b5c78-ad2a-4f1c-885e-b87f58f8868f', '6ab6b2ee-1ca2-4961-b1b6-ea8e0b358b76', '6cc4330d-7101-44a7-979a-bb311dc1dd4d', '7187b197-ab1d-4399-99c0-b3eefd78ba8e', '80fb0466-77b6-4c92-ab61-9699ed9135f4', '93b12c76-74ed-44f1-9a7f-d0d30cbc440f', '985e7a8c-370f-434f-bdae-6b18bd342ae9', '988f4551-81ae-4fc4-8087-11b62d797f6d', '9aaf01bc-d3d8-4b05-955e-8dcc96563f08', 'ae319f56-29ef-4bed-93b0-efb830343e99', 'af77cfc2-fd8f-498a-b640-c9c56c02d970', 'bc5ad957-e5e6-404f-9ed5-407628324ca3', 'cd330180-b0a9-447b-94b0-976c8380be86', 'db467557-5744-4f9b-a281-efbbbdc7b822', 'dd81ab90-9bad-4eda-ac04-39110532153b', 'e6f10535-734a-4f9c-9de3-9e9f42932651', 'f8b73868-9636-4bc5-9fa4-27ce922df16c', 'fac56bce-1753-41df-894a-3b4ef0ea1300']",Optimal design of continuous time irrational filter with a set of fractional order gammatone components via norm relaxed sequential quadratic programming approach,Digital Signal Processing,2017

138,"Scaling skyline queries over high-dimensional datasets remains to be challenging due to the fact that most existing algorithms assume dimensional independence when establishing the worst-case complexity by discarding correlation distribution. In this paper, we present HashSkyline, a systematic and correlation-aware approach for scaling skyline queries over high-dimensional datasets with three novel features: First, it offers a fast hash-based method to prune non-skyline points by utilizing data correlation characteristics and speed up the overall skyline evaluation for correlated datasets. Second, we develop \(HashSkyline_{GPU},\), which can dramatically reduce the response time for anti-correlated and independent datasets by capitalizing on the parallel processing power of GPUs. Third, the HashSkyline approach uses the pivot cell-based mechanism combined with the correlation threshold to determine the correlation distribution characteristics for a given dataset, enabling adaptive configuration of HashSkyline for skyline query evaluation by auto-switching of \(HashSkyline_{CPU},\) and \(HashSkyline_{GPU},\). We evaluate the validity of HashSkyline using both synthetic datasets and real datasets. Our experiments show that HashSkyline consumes significantly less pre-processing cost and achieves significantly higher overall query performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.","['Boseon Yu', 'Wonik Choi', 'Ling Liu']",e554ab57-8389-4b30-96e0-0baafb7e51f0,0,"['02314703-ce35-4158-b4ed-5cc45d224268', '033237d3-a171-4f2d-b014-3f00fb4e72cb', '068601f4-7cfd-4359-aaed-3aed5ccdba5b', '1925b11c-5af2-4bfa-8e95-d7935a6aabe6', '1bd858fd-21b1-4882-bca6-7a0435a892ec', '2df19de7-06ee-424f-8d32-e7d6bde1a0f8', '30f738f6-3fbd-4836-9743-43ab002ddcf2', '339c137d-9ab8-41f7-8395-2826d4e07782', '36fdb8ac-9f67-440f-bece-168601b875e9', '3ebc51d7-eca4-4119-88cf-d6b3e8f1fc41', '4a9ebe82-468b-428e-b028-246f28822e2e', '4cfc1bf6-7b47-4d97-ba7c-42939b66b060', '56d6f62e-41d8-4d01-80cb-a3eed8832800', '61197206-e850-4035-8428-ef3bbebd6b02', '614955f5-c5d2-4ac5-93c5-46b9e97b2afd', '637fa5bf-da78-49ea-a35d-236e620024c8', '646fecaf-1019-453a-8731-d48f8bc29821', '64bcc6df-1fa6-453a-bdf6-31333cea6f23', '6b6fb250-bb2e-4d16-b2a6-9f1f4dbeba9f', '757e8cb4-a377-40fc-9f21-504414d7d066', '7685969a-2d82-4ea4-9fbd-07dac4f17d5f', '82553ffa-0e53-4813-b5c4-798f01623102', '88584736-acf0-4137-833e-4dc509403484', '8883354e-0804-412a-a8b9-398ef0301624', '977b0157-dec7-4fc2-9b39-6e30591fa7ae', 'a377c8e7-8070-4ba1-bc9f-0fcd1f74fa97', 'ae4e6a71-10ea-4e0b-a483-7c091e5b2188', 'b269b55e-b34f-4c56-b6ef-5f126fe03f01', 'bc79f78f-4182-4aaf-839a-7c43e08b51ff', 'c6629549-6a77-4ddc-9925-cc5ee5d8a5a0', 'c6b46be9-6713-4a6d-a399-536fc3bff840', 'c70f7a6c-468c-4894-86f7-e841e4cb0177', 'c88d0ba0-b726-4ebc-aef7-ad7068e3eaae', 'c9fda204-c458-4303-9be7-a54a886e95bc', 'e1da4dc9-2d9d-488f-8230-2d5faefe8be0', 'f17d3dae-360c-45b5-a321-c0c80a340859']",Exploring correlation for fast skyline computation,The Journal of Supercomputing,2017

These services are regular in nature and must be provided at specific times during the week. In this paper, we present a heuristic with two tie-breaking mechanisms suitable for large-scale versions of the problem. The greedy algorithm merges service lots to minimize the accumulated unproductive time. As a result, the solution is restructured in such a way as to increase its efficiency. The approach is tested on a real-world large instance of the problem for a company whose current resource allocation is inefficient. The solutions are benchmarked against the current service assignment and those obtained by a Ward clustering algorithm, and the results show an improvement in efficiency and cost.","['David Quintana', 'Alejandro Cervantes', 'Yago Saez', 'Pedro Isasi']",c8f419af-e293-42c8-b859-b80977c7c6f2,0,"['08b1bd7d-554d-412e-a301-4914e8fcb34a', '0aa5e301-e98e-4619-bdd7-d4393d8afc8b', '107bc9fb-10e6-4db3-af49-f8a5095349a5', '25d60ce2-b128-4e53-a13e-57fbdadbcaa8', '39066ee6-0648-4585-ad6d-29910901ac55', '8917e9fb-c69a-47e3-aecf-fcf390f026a9', 'a0126771-8948-4869-ae55-35f3aa717cb6', 'acf14c8a-e9c0-4f3f-9530-4ce7359df39d', 'c2fd8a65-ae90-4b8d-9700-09557b08996f', 'c5922c1f-8012-42a0-9111-8d5cc3ae6b62', 'c5a580df-e0dc-4f7d-90a7-4bd927a59187']",Clustering technique for large-scale home care crew scheduling problems,Applied Intelligence,2017
140,"In this paper, we propose an efficient parameter tuning-free squared-loss mutual information (SMI) estimator in a form of a radial basis function (RBF) network. The input layer of the proposed network propagates a sample pair of two random variables to the hidden layer. The propagated samples are then transformed by a set of Gaussian RBF kernels with randomly determined kernel centers and widths similar to that in an extreme learning machine. The output layer adopts a linear weighting scheme which can be analytically estimated. Our empirical results show that the proposed estimator outperforms the competing state-of-the-art SMI estimators in terms of computational efficiency while showing the comparable estimation accuracy performance. Moreover, the proposed model achieves promising results in an application study of time-series change-points detection and driving stress.","['Beom-Seok Oh', 'Lei Sun', 'Chung Soo Ahn', 'Yong Kiang Yeo', 'Yan Yang', 'Nan Liu', 'Zhiping Lin']",15babbd2-e7c3-4e5d-8ab6-e4995e2cf5f9,0,"['05984c95-e21b-4162-b83d-165d0c6adcb4', '15006035-015a-44c6-aabe-eb0c13083b4b', '1b933d7c-5ad2-4875-9b19-74cc38747f67', '2b981da0-bb3b-4733-9606-2d5509f7011a', '2cd19002-8056-4876-88cd-1b15ef917f0e', '3034735d-b0cd-4736-b41a-fc1512d5f730', '33abc1fc-50ea-4837-a4a0-65c1d4c0e0b7', '364b8d5b-9ce6-4ff5-b9bb-d3342a9d00d7', '44535b93-b658-416a-97e7-c035e3d89db4', '5c750f9e-23f2-4cde-9a93-afb190ec3157', '78ec3412-fded-4e13-ac1b-c71c6249ade5', '7e1b9629-3105-4da0-ac74-f91a68f86f2b', '8921a871-2b58-4344-b3d2-66321a530e4e', '8e692473-24a8-435d-94fc-fd75d3ea8874', '9199e143-0683-4fca-9d68-a68f6f14b383', '99dfb508-10c1-4e15-bb7c-daa4b7fe1e07', 'b0812150-3a5a-4cc3-b90d-c0354f9ec7dc', 'd1f2cd51-e79c-484e-ac57-90d7e9d767af', 'dbdbb5e2-4e1c-44df-a58f-71ecf0d2d717', 'e8955868-b807-42f7-95b9-81bddfc27272', 'ee1fe00b-7e20-4f24-832a-0a1e6a6b54e0', 'f16a97f7-1358-43b4-a688-490e7d809a74']",Extreme learning machine based mutual information estimation with application to time-series change-points detection,Neurocomputing,2017
141,"Critical infrastructure systems (CISs) are large scale and complex systems, across which many interdependencies exist. As a result, several modeling and simulation approaches are being employed to study the concurrent operation of multiple CISs and their interdependencies. Complementary to existing literature, this work develops and implements a modeling and simulation framework based on open hybrid automata to analyze CISs interdependencies. With the proposed approach, it is possible to develop accurate models of infrastructure components, and interlink them together based on their dependencies; in effect creating larger and more complex models that incorporate interdependencies. By implementing specific setups using varying operating conditions, one can study the cascading effects of interdependencies, perform a detailed vulnerability assessment and conduct an extensive planning exercise. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, a setup with three different types of CISs (i.e., power, telecom and water) components is investigated. Extensive simulation results are used to provide insights on the cascading effects, vulnerabilities and maintenance planning strategies.","['Constantinos Heracleous', 'Panayiotis Kolios', 'Christos G.

143,"Linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) is widely employed in impervious surface estimation, especially for estimating impervious surface abundance in medium spatial resolution images. However, it suffers from a difficulty in endmember selection due to within-class spectral variability and the variation in the number and the type of endmember classes contained from pixel to pixel, which may lead to over or under estimation of impervious surface. Stratification is considered as a promising process to address the problem. This paper presents a stratified spectral mixture analysis in spectral domain (Sp_SSMA) for impervious surface mapping. It categorizes the entire data into three groups based on the Combinational Build-up Index (CBI), the intensity component in the color space and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. A suitable endmember model is developed for each group to accommodate the spectral variation from group to group. The unmixing into the associated subset (or full set) of endmembers in each group can make the unmixing adaptive to the types of endmember classes that each pixel actually contains. Results indicate that the Sp_SSMA method achieves a better performance than full-set-endmember SMA and prior-knowledge-based spectral mixture analysis (PKSMA) in terms of R, RMSE and SE.","['Genyun Sun', 'Xiaolin Chen', 'Jinchang Ren', 'Aizhu Zhang', 'Xiuping Jia']",7215b598-a89b-4b34-8b4e-508064be4366,0,"['0a92b275-2512-48fa-9450-033a5c466755', '1d6024e8-180f-47b0-856f-0227d4ad7577', '3011aefb-cce5-4853-9e30-9a9943ea83b6', '58fa5e74-8274-4013-9697-7cebc33731eb', '8de56b17-0921-488a-b7ad-faf256583dae', 'ad3a338f-beee-459e-b873-01063cda7cb0', 'cccecec6-ea6d-4708-85de-27168b892124', 'cfeabb61-9605-4a87-9e82-df239c81540a', 'f73a3eb7-53e1-4ffc-9755-6dac4bb06c5c']",Stratified spectral mixture analysis of medium resolution imagery for impervious surface mapping,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2017
144,"This paper presents a robust intelligent controller to be applied to a class of nonholonomic electrically driven mobile robots. This class of robotic systems has an inherent sensitivity to high degree time-varying parametric uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances. Furthermore, the effects of coupling terms between the mechanical subsystem and the electrical subsystem may cause severe degradations due to the time-varying variations of DC motors and mechanical structure components around their nominal values. To overcome the effects of all these quantities, the robust adaptive neural network tracking controller developed here introduces adaptive laws to estimate a local upper bound of each subsystem of the nonholonomic mobile robot, then, these laws are used on-line as controller gain parameters in order to robustly improve the transient response of the closed-loop system and reduce conservative, in the sense that the local upper bounds to characterize the corresponding uncertainties dynamics for each subsystem, initially computed based on the worse-case scenario, are not updated during the effective control of the mobile robot. In fact, even if more data become available, then they are avoided when estimating local upper bounds, and hence, the level of uncertainty is considerably decreased. According to the universal approximation theorem and the Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed intelligent controller guarantees global stability in the sense that all the states and signals of the closed-loop system, and the trajectory tracking errors are all bounded. Simulation results on two typical examples of nonholonomic electrically driven mobile robots show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller.","['Mohammed Boukens', 'Abdelkrim Boukabou', 'Mohammed Chadli']",686049c2-0a4d-42d9-aeb4-236eeb44db27,0,"['08876175-227c-4d76-a553-4b5e711a64fd', '0ff73035-ce20-4253-8641-23b45bd0aeb1', '13fba45d-4843-4604-8f4f-0ca9538fabe9', '1777dac8-53dc-4b1c-8901-1328552d2326', '2c870fc8-8657-441f-bffe-6a820c693a64', '2e584521-5356-47d2-9591-82e2a0ca4e26', '6ff92d9b-d12e-4612-aa3c-38c2ba29e206', '73862c80-ba44-408e-acaa-7176f77374f8', '75096ae3-6af7-4765-bc52-5bc6497110fe', '7d1a163b-d4e4-440a-bd44-be4f84f1685d', '975122cf-c198-4e73-b37d-1f604aa73658', 'affa65cc-a144-445e-8a0b-ffbdf56579bf', 'cc622bf2-f488-44d4-a14f-61ec891ceeca', 'cda9ae2f-d284-4e79-a269-82af5466b938', 'eb96b451-d235-40dc-b993-fd3bab8cb18b']",Robust adaptive neural network-based trajectory tracking control approach for nonholonomic electrically driven mobile robots,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2017
145,"A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) approach that always outperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA) called Fair-NOMA is introduced. In Fair-NOMA, each mobile user is allocated its share of the transmit power such that its capacity is always greater than or equal to the capacity that can be achieved using OMA. For any slow-fading channel gains of the two users, the set of possible power allocation coefficients are derived. For the infimum and supremum of this set, the individual capacity gains and the sum-rate capacity gain are derived. It is shown that the ergodic sum-rate capacity gain approaches 1 b/s/Hz when the transmit power increases for the case when pairing two random users with i.i.d. channel gains. The outage probability of this approach is derived and shown to be better than OMA. #R##N#The Fair-NOMA approach is applied to the case of pairing a near base-station user and a cell-edge user and the ergodic capacity gap is derived as a function of total number of users in the cell at high SNR. This is then compared to the conventional case of fixed-power NOMA with user-pairing. Finally, Fair-NOMA is extended to $K$ users and prove that the capacity can always be improved for each user, while using less than the total transmit power required to achieve OMA capacities per user.","['Jose Armando Oviedo', 'Hamid R.

146,"We present a visualization pipeline capable of accurate rendering of highly scattering fluorescent neocortical neuronal models. The pipeline is mainly developed to serve the computational neurobiology community. It allows the scientists to visualize the results of their virtual experiments that are performed in computer simulations, or in silico. The impact of the presented pipeline opens novel avenues for assisting the neuroscientists to build biologically accurate models of the brain. These models result from computer simulations of physical experiments that use fluorescence imaging to understand the structural and functional aspects of the brain. Due to the limited capabilities of the current visualization workflows to handle fluorescent volumetric datasets, we propose a physically-based optical model that can accurately simulate light interaction with fluorescent-tagged scattering media based on the basic principles of geometric optics and Monte Carlo path tracing. We also develop an automated and efficient framework for generating dense fluorescent tissue blocks from a neocortical column model that is composed of approximately 31000 neurons. Our pipeline is used to visualize a virtual fluorescent tissue block of 50 μm3 that is reconstructed from the somatosensory cortex of juvenile rat. The fluorescence optical model is qualitatively analyzed and validated against experimental emission spectra of different fluorescent dyes from the Alexa Fluor family.

Both methods were applicable to locate and categorise the malfunctions when using steady state data without measurement uncertainties. By introduction of measurement uncertainty, the categorisation of malfunctions became increasingly difficult, though depending on the magnitude of the uncertainties. Two different uncertainty scenarios were evaluated, as the use of repeated measurements yields a lower magnitude of uncertainty. The two methods show similar performance in the presented study for both of the considered measurement uncertainty scenarios. However, only in the low measurement uncertainty scenario, both methods are applicable to locate the causes of the malfunctions. For both the scenarios an outlier limit was found, which determines if it was possible to reject a high relative indicator based on measurement uncertainty. For high uncertainties, the threshold value of the relative indicator was 35, whereas for low uncertainties one of the methods resulted in a threshold at 8. Additionally, the contribution of different measuring instruments to the relative indicator in two central components was analysed. It shows that the contribution was component dependent.","['Torben Schmidt Ommen', 'Oskar Sigthorsson', 'Brian Elmegaard']",f9b81736-4849-4d8b-9e80-fb799ae6dd02,0,[],Two Thermoeconomic Diagnosis Methods Applied to Representative Operating Data of a Commercial Transcritical Refrigeration Plant,Entropy,2017
148,"Statistical smoothing in general non-linear non-Gaussian systems is a challenging problem. A new smoothing method based on approximating the original system by a recent switching model has been introduced. Such switching model allows fast and optimal smoothing. The new algorithm is validated through an application on stochastic volatility and dynamic beta models. Simulation experiments indicate its remarkable performances and low processing cost. In practice, the proposed approach can overcome the limitations of particle smoothing methods and may apply where their usage is discarded.","['I. V.

149,"Over the last few years, autonomic network and service management has emerged as a serious alternative to traditional management approaches. In these systems, distributed entities, called autonomic managers, perform monitoring and control operations in an autonomous and decentralized way. The monitoring consists of providing indicators on the state of the system. Several monitoring solutions have been proposed to enable autonomic managers to obtain a partial or complete knowledge of an indicator through aggregation processes. Such a profusion of solutions raises important questions regarding the choice of an aggregation scheme in a particular operational context and for a particular management information because each class of solution presents different benefits and weaknesses. That is why, in this paper, we present the result of our study of decentralized aggregation schemes for autonomic network and service monitoring. The contribution is twofold: i a survey of decentralized aggregation schemes based on a refined taxonomy; and ii the results of an evaluation campaign we performed to compare typical aggregation schemes. These results highlight the context, in terms of the managed network behaviour as well as information dynamics, in which each aggregation scheme outperforms the others, thus helping autonomic management system designers in choosing the best scheme for their management purpose.

150,"The conformal prediction framework allows for specifying the probability of making incorrect predictions by a user-provided confidence level. In addition to a learning algorithm, the framework requires a real-valued function, called nonconformity measure, to be specified. The nonconformity measure does not affect the error rate, but the resulting efficiency, i.e., the size of output prediction regions, may vary substantially. A recent large-scale empirical evaluation of conformal regression approaches showed that using random forests as the learning algorithm together with a nonconformity measure based on out-of-bag errors normalized using a nearest-neighbor-based difficulty estimate, resulted in state-of-the-art performance with respect to efficiency. However, the nearest-neighbor procedure incurs a significant computational cost. In this study, a more straightforward nonconformity measure is investigated, where the difficulty estimate employed for normalization is based on the variance of the predictions made by the trees in a forest. A large-scale empirical evaluation is presented, showing that both the nearest-neighbor-based and the variance-based measures significantly outperform a standard (non-normalized) nonconformity measure, while no significant difference in efficiency between the two normalized approaches is observed. The evaluation moreover shows that the computational cost of the variance-based measure is several orders of magnitude lower than when employing the nearest-neighbor-based nonconformity measure. The use of out-of-bag instances for calibration does, however, result in nonconformity scores that are distributed differently from those obtained from test instances, questioning the validity of the approach. An adjustment of the variance-based measure is presented, which is shown to be valid and also to have a significant positive effect on the efficiency. For conformal regression forests, the variance-based nonconformity measure is hence a computationally efficient and theoretically well-founded alternative to the nearest-neighbor procedure.","['Henrik Boström', 'Henrik Linusson', 'Tuve Löfström', 'Ulf Johansson']",d1a0aaa1-c4a9-4662-ae6c-2c0aa48cc1a7,0,"['0f115eea-2272-431f-9f21-6d6789b2bbc9', '59d4f3be-0a70-46a5-b918-c81dc0f7ccff', '6fc796ee-3127-4983-a2c9-2e73943a224d', '7bc911cc-6027-4e4c-9a45-44218616fab1', 'aa767a83-de19-4421-bfb4-f63808992758', 'e2ac85a5-137b-4b22-aaec-5c5d229b616d', 'e3173978-3bfc-4406-948a-c59d473e2819', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6']",Accelerating difficulty estimation for conformal regression forests,Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence,2017
151,"Educating society concerning stigmatized conditions, such as the eating disorder Anorexia Nervosa (AN), aims to change attitudes that will encourage individuals with AN to recognize their condition and decide to seek help. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) may play an important role in bringing about changes in attitude and behavior because they potentially allow tailored but anonymous, free and convenient access and can deliver the information in a conversational way that overcomes health literacy barriers. In this first study we compare the use of an ECA with a video to deliver two strategies (education and contact) to address stigma around the mental health condition of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our results with 245 participants show that both media (ECA and video) aided recognition of AN and produced significant changes in positive volitional stigma and negative volitional stigma but not in traditional stigma (desire for social distance), with some notable differences based on gender. Baseline data was used in place of a control group and the sample population was undergraduate Psychology students due to higher incidences of AN in this population. Further validation is needed involving a control group and testing on populations other than Psychology students. Nevertheless, these initial results encourage our future work to build tailored ECAs to challenge particular beliefs to support a wide range of educational interventions to change behaviors and improve decision-making relating to health and wellbeing.","['Joel Sebastian', 'Deborah Richards']",82d7fd00-98e0-4960-8e4f-e5c6e77b6df6,0,"['3e62ae07-b386-451a-af62-c788cab69a87', '4e0b9ff9-8196-4c0c-86f2-db1df85c866b', '703c5099-df43-49aa-80e8-49e8a7a0b9ad', '8645c2c7-328a-4b5e-9975-c0b62b361761', '98579a4f-0de9-4e2a-9bd0-81b15e5aeeaa', 'a23551d0-acf9-44b7-bdce-7be736f3730d', 'b2a47713-fcec-4cc1-981a-62a9a69f83d9', 'b9a48125-a71a-4563-98de-e5579400f239', 'c58226f6-923d-4691-9101-e4d59dcc3282', 'f058f815-4256-4572-a5c1-b2c9bff6c03c', 'f642628f-9d3c-4ada-8768-edd21f798ca1']",Changing stigmatizing attitudes to mental health via education and contact with embodied conversational agents,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
152,"This paper reports novel routes to complex bursting patterns based on a forced cubic map, in which boundary-crisis-induced novel bursting patterns are investigated. Typically, the cubic map exhibits stable upper and lower branches of fixed points, which may evolve into chaos in opposite parameter directions by a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations. We show that the chaotic attractors on the stable branches may suddenly disappear by boundary crisis, thus leading to fast transitions from chaos to other attractors and giving rise to switchings between the stable branches of solutions of the cubic map. In particular, the attractors that the trajectory switches to by boundary crisis can be fixed points, periodic orbits and chaos, dependent on parameter values of the cubic map, and this helps us to reveal three general types of boundary-crisis-induced bursting, i.e. bursting of chaos-point type, bursting of chaos-cycle type and bursting of chaos-chaos type.

153,"The nature of free communication results in increased challenges with respect to the reliability of user interaction in online social network. It is difficult to ensure that the users in a large-scale network are familiar with one another and that they interact without risk. Users’ behaviors might therefore be vulnerable to attacks or frauds. Trust relationship detection scheme is a feasible solution. This study proposes an original trust link detection scheme, named Trust Traversal, which includes three aspects, i.e., trust scheme, trust link category, and traversal scheme, which are used to build up strong or weak trust links among users. Firstly, we address overview of Trust Traversal scheme and its related formal definitions. Then, trust scheme model is proposed for managing calculation methods of subjective trust, reputation, and indirect link. Subjective trust is calculated based on past interaction data, while reputation is defined as collective objective trust with three factors: effective accumulation, time attenuation, and intensity factor. Additionally, trust of indirect link in trust scheme is computed with three rules: trust transitivity rule, reputation weight rule, and level attenuation rule. To describe the relationship with both reliability and closeness, we present a trust link category, which comprise three kinds of trust links: strong trust link, weak trust link, and untrusted link, and meanwhile, gives the classifying method based on two factors: mutual trust factor and interaction active factor. Moreover, Trust Traversal scheme for both single and multiple target users is proposed to detect strong or weak trust links, which implies trustable and close relationships among users. In Trust Traversal scheme, each step is determined by trust based probability, and thus the user with the strongest trust link would have the highest probability of being the traversal user in the trust link. And also, terminal mechanism of Trust Traversal scheme is discussed. Finally, we provide an examination to determine further the performance of our proposed scheme.","['Zhang Bo', 'Zhang Huan', 'Li Meizi', 'Zhao Qin', 'Huang Ji-feng']",6842b9ed-e37a-4946-90be-c4c68d98d7df,0,"['111878ed-c709-4ca9-9a8f-8259136b6854', '113dd9d8-041f-43e7-8460-ae672029ec1e', '126ab048-2669-431a-8d02-369423504cac', '15d22ace-5794-487b-b35d-06ff4b2e200c', '16b98622-f79c-4800-9f8e-18f74ccca104', '16df709c-8770-4a72-89da-7492e07b6f81', '1c3d8d76-bef5-4aeb-b002-3030a04b65c4', '1e47880b-ff54-4110-a9c2-de0af73dbec7', '1ea58008-678d-4f7e-a19b-0cc62e5dbd29', '2a1d9cc6-40a9-49b0-bf72-627316074d18', '2c9f4c4f-a88e-4603-8121-25be93c2d7ac', '3fd9df89-7f41-43c0-82e7-26c4a9a40eb4', '4a39c97f-9d81-4cf7-ac75-5b9c76df88fe', '5c31e352-f192-4fa9-8ef5-e44c52b42b03', '6363715e-6c94-4832-861b-33a724c232d5', '63674dc2-672b-4cc1-90ac-1fb3603d4ebf', '65630e87-2546-4c61-a134-d5830ee79d60', '6e75c759-cdee-498c-92ba-2df73f7e0026', '77bb1b03-9eee-4e46-a140-4683c6afd3e3', '7de52ff0-1aed-43d2-89a7-f8ad0b74a4a7', '7f74e7fa-aa6b-43b0-aa2a-dcb6d777ae83', '85170914-525c-4451-9035-1fd9728fb1ea', '8acdc635-8d8e-4e2b-b63c-ba553583bc00', '8d5c7a91-8542-4f6b-9ab1-75704491041c', '8e2c2a4d-5b9f-4e4b-94fb-63472a02765e', '95d9c581-3523-4488-85b2-4eb6da9487b1', '9e1082ef-a855-462c-ab68-2d1fb3799bda', 'a75dd22d-653f-406c-ade1-00ed1e378a4c', 'aba92418-88c1-4914-9121-7ff238691c38', 'b074e2b6-3580-4d05-a75e-2645b4e13b28', 'beb14684-d0f4-4f76-a392-1a38882ceba3', 'c24f8f7b-da4f-46d7-bfc9-17a18b1c6ca3', 'c3c9d078-7efc-43a0-822a-608531b58ae1', 'c4716aad-c8bc-431b-8173-0300064a77b0', 'cae10541-d003-4e23-ad78-06ebee9234ba', 'ccd66468-31d5-4622-b5d9-cb28015d20f0', 'd1c4b0b2-83e7-468c-b200-6bcfac969c5c', 'd2001210-7a89-40ec-a572-45c43c330934', 'ea9087d8-58c0-4637-a905-208aa6910cc7']",Trust Traversal: A trust link detection scheme in social network,Computer Networks,2017

155,"We consider the joint estimation of time-varying linear prediction (TVLP) filter coefficients and the excitation signal parameters for the analysis of long-term speech segments. Traditional approaches to TVLP estimation assume linear expansion of the coefficients in a set of known basis functions only. But, excitation signal is also time-varying, which affects the estimation of TVLP filter parameters. In this letter, we propose a Bayesian approach, to incorporate the nature of excitation signal and also adapt regularization of the filter parameters. Since the order of the system is not known a priori, we formulate a Gaussian prior for the filter parameters, and the excitation signal is modeled as Gaussian with time-varying Gamma distributed precision. We develop an iterative algorithm for the maximum-likelihood estimation of the posterior distribution of filter parameters and the time-varying precision of the excitation signal, along with the parameters of the prior distribution. We show that the proposed method adapts to different types of excitation signals in speech, and also the time-varying system with unknown model order. The spectral modeling performance for synthetic speech-like signals, quantified using the absolute spectral difference shows that the proposed method estimates the system function more accurately compared to several of the traditional methods.","['Srikanth Raj Chetupalli', 'Thippur V.

156,"Exponential random graph models are an important tool in the statistical analysis of data. However, Bayesian parameter estimation for these models is extremely challenging, since evaluation of the posterior distribution typically involves the calculation of an intractable normalizing constant. This barrier motivates the consideration of tractable approximations to the likelihood function, such as the pseudolikelihood function, which offers an approach to constructing such an approximation. Naive implementation of what we term a pseudo-posterior resulting from replacing the likelihood function in the posterior distribution by the pseudolikelihood is likely to give misleading inferences. We provide practical guidelines to correct a sample from such a pseudo-posterior distribution so that it is approximately distributed from the target posterior distribution and discuss the computational and statistical efficiency that result from this approach. We illustrate our methodology through the analysis of real-world graphs. Comparisons against the approximate exchange algorithm of Caimo and Friel (2011) are provided, followed by concluding remarks.","['Lampros Bouranis', 'Nial Friel', 'Florian Maire']",967301a6-d7e6-4903-9224-e9c5039ff80f,0,"['25a21ccb-047c-403b-b0d7-0bf47c5d1e9e', '27bab180-0f19-4e35-b348-fe22348e254d', '327acedb-5aeb-4a65-95c6-46d0375ff894', '60d9cbee-deac-4c70-8d64-0b5abceab6be', '6b1a9060-e7ca-4b87-bdd4-1893b9784b3c', '6c7d583f-0b62-4ff0-987c-2f2e1268a5ba', '865070e1-501b-4c8c-a2a9-c79e41e6e0e3', '8872ea41-43c8-4e1d-81bc-2267afad7e65', '9c00a39a-664f-4bf7-8cba-a360ed252909', 'd7d64c78-94f5-4f32-89cd-0d6d99286900']",Efficient Bayesian inference for exponential random graph models by correcting the pseudo-posterior distribution,Social Networks,2017
157,"This paper proposes a joint clustering relay selection and beamforming method for a more realistic cooperative cognitive radio network, in which a secondary network of multiple secondary links and a relay network coexist with a primary network of one primary link. We aim to improve performance of the system in terms of maximizing the received signal power of the secondary destinations, subject to the constraint of received interference plus noise power of the primary destination using the proposed method. Since different relays cooperate differently towards the signals at the secondary and primary destinations, the proposed method can improve the performance of the system and enables the relay network to simultaneously transmit signals of all secondary links toward the destinations by clustering the relays. Results of simulations confirm validity of the method and improve the system performance compared to the existing cooperative beamforming and Zero-Forcing beamforming, in which no relay selection strategy is used.","['Javad Zeraatkar Moghaddam', 'Hamid Farrokhi', 'Naaser Neda']",e06dcbcd-62b2-4062-8428-59b90f9da802,0,"['0d290bc8-1603-485d-8ca5-2945a89ffd94', '141d357d-b084-4f8e-a675-cd2fe3597e5d', '1b3c280c-c9f1-42f4-be49-b8ce4cd745be', '2a020bab-df92-43b4-86f0-0066e8e1eae8', '2fe6cff0-412c-4f6f-82ea-01f9f2767fb6', '345c5f88-d3e4-474b-aadd-37f6615dd04e', '5c0f70aa-507e-47ab-8dbe-43d40a33168f', '63313e5e-555e-4ecb-8c69-5b88b565948f', '67878621-aeb5-4ed3-9cd9-ad49c35be4a3', '74734772-ea86-4bd3-8330-9d4dc98e40df', '773e3d34-1e2a-4dd8-8d1c-29924f400a80', '93f5575c-c86e-4a7a-a48f-a90f4241535f', 'a5be3ac0-25fc-4d94-b1ea-fe5106659467', 'aee3b044-c8b0-4553-8faf-4d3c5fefd2cf', 'd1018e97-179d-4ebd-89c4-e097d4b649f9', 'f1e74152-3f7c-4c44-b628-cdf47a17587f', 'f6c11fd3-9231-40c2-9c6d-713c04e714e7', 'fa68ed28-345e-4455-9ae5-5a8dc4356e0f']",Joint Clustering Relay Selection and Beamforming in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

In the image reconstruction, we compute the smoothing part of the image from the smoothed tangential field for the first step, and use an anisotropic TV model to obtain the “texture” part of the deblurred image. The solvability properties for the minimization problems in two steps are established, and fast algorithms are presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new deblurring model can capture the details of images hidden in the blurry and noisy image, and the fast algorithms are efficient and robust.","['Zhigang Jia', 'Musheng Wei']",eb1bb20d-2575-4eb3-830d-768316efd5ed,0,"['050cbd64-68da-407e-b0bd-fe0475566079', '0af306d5-763c-443a-bae5-5b1b8beaa5e4', '100d4c2a-ba94-4bc9-8600-33461dc28c29', '101a796a-1c42-4335-861a-e88d88b39739', '1cc8f484-eeac-462f-9dce-4b93a1942be0', '1e374360-8051-4e65-874a-e485123ccbae', '32c45595-be57-4829-a274-3475f258dca4', '38711beb-3c11-4f5f-8f61-3530053446e3', '509ba4be-958f-4496-afc2-bbd0e59b50c3', '52e55346-2fb4-45a8-9e50-db06f3343982', '5917b4d5-c54d-413b-950f-8425d0ea37a7', '59621163-68b7-4883-a6eb-496f86adab04', '5d136308-0021-4a30-9926-942912666cb3', '5d1a798d-8088-46fe-b1a7-22b34105e75e', '6b42d0b1-c116-4315-b0a9-ca17827ddccb', '6e6842a7-0033-43e5-8943-b5dfaa8fe18a', '83a47369-908e-4856-a8d1-3082a6a07bbc', '882d91a5-e7ee-4c5b-a9dc-147fa3151f1d', '8a946b98-ad3f-422d-ac7b-be5fe1b9d34e', '8ad502ac-ee0d-4430-a201-cd506de8beaf', '905cd86f-0aa8-490f-a072-4b92ffb548b2', '90a86606-d901-42da-b636-b548a54744fb', '9b166075-5b89-4ec5-91db-47e5ca47c7ec', '9ebe0155-6839-49bc-a71a-0aff2e694c75', 'a253bfa1-2fa7-494d-9e49-b370bd4ea9c1', 'b28eb10d-84ab-427b-b9df-8209211b9ad8', 'c0ce93fe-6aa5-48f2-8d5a-91192c65013e', 'c9ef3dc8-4117-4dc4-8aa5-19d8af78766c', 'cb9a6712-6e99-4753-91a4-8acb1beda8bd', 'd06175bf-9af9-4e69-b932-f9bbb8fefbeb', 'd6226aaf-9cf0-47b6-af0b-c6d743a7b327', 'ee941f02-3395-405b-835b-9e382e4c7d80', 'f0a79022-7d78-467e-a59c-a74f5f08a48d', 'f22ad53e-59c6-43c7-8d74-333507e2afb3']",A New TV-Stokes Model for Image Deblurring and Denoising with Fast Algorithms,Journal of Scientific Computing,2017
160,"The plastic wave speed is derived from the linearized 1-D version of the widely used viscous–plastic (VP) and elastic–viscous–plastic (EVP) sea-ice models. Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) conditions are derived using the propagation speed of the wave. 1-D numerical experiments of the VP, EVP and EVP ⁎  models successfully recreate a reference solution when the CFL conditions are satisfied, in agreement with the theory presented. The IMplicit–EXplicit (IMEX) method is shown to effectively alleviate the plastic wave CFL constraint on the timestep in the implicitly solved VP model in both 1-D and 2-D. In 2-D, the EVP and EVP ⁎  models show first order error in the simulated velocity field when the plastic wave is not resolved. EVP simulations are performed with various advective timestep, number of subcycles, and elastic-wave damping timescales. It is found that increasing the number of subcycles beyond that needed to resolve the elastic wave does not improve the quality of the solution. It is found that reducing the elastic wave damping timescale reduces the spatial extent of first order errors cause by the unresolved plastic wave. Reducing the advective timestep so that the plastic wave is resolved also reduces the velocity error in terms of magnitude and spatial extent. However, the parameter set required for convergence to within the error bars of satellite (RGPS) deformation fields is impractical for use in climate model simulations. The behavior of the EVP ⁎  method is analogous to that of the EVP method except that it is not possible to reduce the damping timescale with   α=β     α  =  β       .","['James Williams', 'L.

161,"In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient wavelet-based adaptive weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for hydrodynamics and ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations arising from the hyperbolic conservation systems. The proposed method works with the finite difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (FD-WENO) method in space and the third order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge–Kutta (RK) method in time. The philosophy of this work is to use the lifted interpolating wavelets as not only detector for singularities but also interpolator. Especially, flexible interpolations can be performed by an inverse wavelet transformation. When the divergence cleaning method introducing auxiliary scalar field  ψ  is applied to the base numerical schemes for imposing divergence-free condition to the magnetic field in a MHD equation, the approximations to derivatives of  ψ  require the neighboring points. Moreover, the fifth order WENO interpolation requires large stencil to reconstruct high order polynomial. In such cases, an efficient interpolation method is necessary. The adaptive spatial differentiation method is considered as well as the adaptation of grid resolutions. In order to avoid the heavy computation of FD-WENO, in the smooth regions fixed stencil approximation without computing the non-linear WENO weights is used, and the characteristic decomposition method is replaced by a component-wise approach. Numerical results demonstrate that with the adaptive method we are able to resolve the solutions that agree well with the solution of the corresponding fine grid.","['Seongju Do', 'Haojun Li', 'Myungjoo Kang']",7cf2475e-31fe-4c5f-b763-d850a664d24f,0,"['0bf45bbe-17e4-4acd-8528-631a9643ed11', '27fbddff-5468-4ef2-bc88-731164659eb2', '34d2e51b-fd2a-415e-a20b-5a9704e7cd09', '58432849-b407-4239-a140-fa6b7cd971e2', '5ac8b5ef-7192-4216-8c2d-d0c9f48e970c', '6535ab8e-badb-45e4-aa8c-0bf08f3edf61', '6ed454bb-6f9d-417a-9ad4-f5b4800c81f0', '72d773ac-a565-406a-9577-8af5cafc5a83', '809ecec3-5c9b-4f9b-9a4e-52ffb0262b57', '9ca958b1-f83e-43a8-9b8e-56c74a2aaa4d', 'beb55257-908e-4fc0-8f2d-e72bc130610d', 'e2f6b57a-536d-4b31-a1be-4a813751be69', 'e850c75b-a2a7-49f0-a177-c8a75cca7eaf']",Wavelet-based adaptation methodology combined with finite difference WENO to solve ideal magnetohydrodynamics,Journal of Computational Physics,2017

The commuters spend significant time of their journey either for their turn to cross the intersections or in the congestion on the path. For reducing the total travel time, it is essential to minimize the waiting time at intersections and find best/optimal congestion-free paths for smoother movement of vehicular traffic on roads. A novel Preemptive Modified Ant Colony Optimization (MACO-P) algorithm has been proposed in this paper for reducing the total travel time. The Modified Ant Colony Optimization (MACO) algorithm is used in literature to avoid the congested path by sensing the pheromone trail.

The extreme situation that a supremum is zero represents what is called a Weak Dutch Book (WDB) in a betting interpretation language. While most of the previous dedicated literature focused on WDBs for de Finetti's coherence with precise probabilities, in this paper we analyse the properties of WDBs with imprecise previsions, notably for conditional (Williams') coherent lower previsions. We show that WDB assessments ensure a certain ‘local precision’ property and imply, in the agent's evaluation, some kind of ‘protection’ against real losses. Further, these properties vary with the consistency notion we adopt, tending to vanish with weaker ones. A generalisation of the classical strict coherence and other alternative approaches to WDBs are also discussed.","['Chiara Corsato', 'Renato Pelessoni', 'Paolo Vicig']",f270f085-5cba-4644-8e68-5b91dc029a70,0,"['1a23f435-8624-48f5-8c55-90397065c3dd', '1d343e0c-ba7d-4081-ac1e-19f0c283e82a', '1e3c958e-e254-47b5-9c66-a6642f3e83b5', '30e5edcb-39f2-48e4-9575-ca8284fd3aef', '3885cf04-b352-4f86-bf87-e5601d2ef097', '721767ce-f570-419f-8f45-68867ed114dc', '785b2ff1-32f8-489a-ad3c-026851935dda', 'dda22594-9237-4a08-b54b-c1bece09eab2', 'ec3b1aea-52e1-4fb3-82b8-035b80a99249']",Weak Dutch Books with imprecise previsions,International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,2017
164,"Recent experiments have shown that GABAA receptor mediated inhibition in adult hippocampus is shunting rather than hyperpolarizing. Simulation studies of realistic interneuron networks with strong shunting inhibition have been demonstrated to exhibit robust gamma band (20–80 Hz) synchrony in the presence of heterogeneity in the intrinsic firing rates of individual neurons in the network. In order to begin to understand how shunting can contribute to network synchrony in the presence of heterogeneity, we develop a general theoretical framework using spike time response curves (STRC’s) to study patterns of synchrony in a simple network of two unidirectionally coupled interneurons (UCI network) interacting through a shunting synapse in the presence of heterogeneity. We derive an approximate discrete map to analyze the dynamics of synchronous states in the UCI network by taking into account the nonlinear contributions of the higher order STRC terms. We show how the approximate discrete map can be used to successfully predict the domain of synchronous 1:1 phase locked state in the UCI network. The discrete map also allows us to determine the conditions under which the two interneurons can exhibit in-phase synchrony. We conclude by demonstrating how the information from the study of the discrete map for the dynamics of the UCI network can give us valuable insight into the degree of synchrony in a larger feed-forward network of heterogeneous interneurons.","['Sachin S.

165,"Knowing the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the chromatin is important for obtaining a complete picture of the regulatory landscape. Changes in the 3D structure have been implicated in diseases. While there exist approaches that attempt to predict the long-range chromatin interactions, they focus only on interactions between specific genomic regions — the promoters and enhancers, neglecting other possibilities, for instance, the so-called structural interactions involving intervening chromatin. We present a method that can be trained on 5C data using the genetic sequence of the candidate loci to predict potential genome-wide interaction partners of a particular locus of interest. We have built locus-specific support vector machine (SVM)-based predictors using the oligomer distance histograms (ODH) representation. The method shows good performance with a mean test AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) of 0.7 or higher for various regions across cell lines GM12878, K562 and HeLa-S3. In cases where any locus did not have sufficient candidate interaction partners for model training, we employed multitask learning to share knowledge between models of different loci. In this scenario, across the three cell lines, the method attained an average performance increase of 0.09 in the AUC. Performance evaluation of the models trained on 5C data regarding prediction on an independent high-resolution Hi-C dataset (which is a rather hard problem) shows 0.56 AUC, on average. Additionally, we have developed new, intuitive visualization methods that enable interpretation of sequence signals that contributed towards prediction of locus-specific interaction partners. The analysis of these sequence signals suggests a potential general role of short tandem repeat sequences in genome organization. We demonstrated how our approach can 1) provide insights into sequence features of locus-specific interaction partners, and 2) also identify their cell-line specificity. That our models deem short tandem repeat sequences as discriminative for prediction of potential interaction partners, suggests that they could play a larger role in genome organization. Thus, our approach can (a) be beneficial to broadly understand, at the sequence-level, chromatin interactions and higher-order structures like (meta-) topologically associating domains (TADs); (b) study regions omitted from existing prediction approaches using various information sources (e.g., epigenetic information); and (c) improve methods that predict the 3D structure of the chromatin.","['Sarvesh Nikumbh', 'Nico Pfeifer']",0198ef8a-be52-4faa-b22a-2f1c07ca5f80,0,"['0cb96d79-ba56-4ee9-b7bf-f1e587c54a29', '108d6279-b005-42c8-b350-5903dfa95e59', '29aff231-d123-44a9-9abc-a61183eac261', '35fb5669-75be-48f3-8754-d5dcab5e1a40', '6e8fdc32-616d-4dd6-9bce-a7fc1e6ff732', '896463b5-690e-48be-b81a-e7f9bf4aa059', '9e9230f4-a2cc-4a65-bd29-305cac0cdbe9', 'a4142048-9ef0-49cb-8a37-d4664bd614aa', 'ea3bfcdf-98a0-4bc8-9bef-aabc1c41f610', 'f006e236-59ad-4647-a59f-4f46dc2c85be']",Genetic sequence-based prediction of long-range chromatin interactions suggests a potential role of short tandem repeat sequences in genome organization,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
166,"We consider an extension of the dynamic speed scaling scheduling model introduced by Yao et al. [1]: A set of jobs, each with a release time, deadline, and workload, has to be scheduled on a single, speed-scalable processor. Both the maximum allowed speed of the processor and the energy costs may vary continuously over time. The objective is to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the total energy costs.#R##N##R##N#Theoretical algorithm design for speed scaling problems often tends to discretize problems, as our tools in the discrete realm are often better developed or understood. Using the above speed scaling variant with variable, continuous maximal processor speeds and energy prices as an example, we demonstrate that a more direct approach via tools from variational calculus can not only lead to a very concise and elegant formulation and analysis, but also avoids the “explosion of variables/constraints” that often comes with discretizing [2]. Using well-known tools from calculus of variations, we derive combinatorial optimality characteristics for our continuous problem and provide a quite concise and simple correctness proof.","['Antonios Antoniadis', 'Peter Kling', 'Sebastian Ott', 'Sören Riechers']",79cd6da7-234e-4956-a2b1-5c4734485683,0,"['0e975a27-fb5e-493e-a3c6-f51b25477a99', '15b67550-04b6-442e-80f5-2af197886884', '1e98de2f-75e2-4fdf-b962-8b8d0de3e4bc', '2c5d7c58-b8b2-4ad7-b260-568a3316e203', '50795a0d-6df4-471f-8124-598ed3c8d376', '533d4814-ef39-4256-84f7-22fab40821bc', '61e6d1a7-c585-4aa6-9da3-e2fb3b1d68c4', '82e05028-b3df-492a-9909-e4ea7b5a3e8a', '8a6d10b5-7c01-419e-89e8-2ac68a0ed91d', '90249b06-dd81-4793-a382-b7beb3c3763a', '93b14f9a-884c-441a-b91d-66a659248c0d', 'a533b658-1e7a-4fad-98e8-34e193a7b709', 'bc579eb2-db40-41b5-97df-4d34e9eeda34', 'bf87cabb-309c-4eb8-a8ce-b64e454725eb', 'd3e47a8c-5460-4761-a10c-1e445e958d45', 'dac5f8c4-258c-4b74-96d3-5f5d4ac6a72d']",Continuous speed scaling with variability: A simple and direct approach,Theoretical Computer Science,2017

168,"Three-way decision (3WD) models have been widely investigated in the fields of approximate reasoning and decision making. Recently, sequential 3WD models have attracted increasing interest, especially for image data analysis. It is essential to select an appropriate feature extraction and granulation method for sequential 3WD-based image data analysis. Among the existing feature extraction methods, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been considered widely due to their powerful capacity for representation. However, several important problems affect the application of DNN-based feature extraction methods to sequential 3WD. First, it takes a long time for a DNN to obtain an optimal feature representation. Second, most DNN algorithms are cost-blind methods and they assume that the costs of all misclassifications are the same, which is not the case in real-world scenarios. Third, DNN algorithms are two-way decision models and they cannot provide boundary decisions if sufficient information is not available. To address these problems, we propose a DNN-based sequential granular feature extraction method, which sequentially extracts a hierarchical granular structure from the input images. Based on the sequential multi-level granular features, a cost-sensitive sequential 3WD strategy is presented that considers the misclassification cost and test cost in different decision phases. Our experimental analysis validated the effectiveness of the proposed sequential DNN-based feature extraction method for 3WD.","['Huaxiong Li', 'Libo Zhang', 'Xianzhong Zhou', 'Bing Huang']",9019f3ee-dc4b-4ecd-bdf7-830c4d4fc13b,0,"['0555ecc0-6751-468b-8e47-b7b9450f8eaf', '056e50b1-00fa-4b1c-a54d-db2097f272ab', '0bbcc02f-bd4f-4edb-ae0f-17a1e99c98b4', '143e42e0-f628-4428-aa7c-4db702ad31d2', '17409d9f-3fe0-4f7a-8b72-d9b8ddd359aa', '1943efd1-c53d-4cff-84eb-b94e753ae200', '1e41171c-0be2-48a8-9c1a-7ce31317f6d4', '1f5b143f-9f8b-4429-82ab-38384a165b4a', '32d158dc-6f9f-426a-973b-8edc5e4c5dad', '339e74e2-0f23-425a-8913-6bc4b8614f20', '3a769c84-589b-45cc-bb2e-4a34d6e0669d', '3f61a962-d24b-48a6-bec2-e09db41679a6', '46472652-1a45-4804-8f90-80aea557773e', '53ec69b9-5acf-4bed-8a8a-16ca4dd7f01a', '550d3be3-31e0-411b-a950-31887915f969', '561ff9e5-48c9-4956-907d-815907f5c2c6', '58f61d5d-36ff-4de8-80d7-7275938cb46b', '5b42fc1a-7835-4b76-b3ae-0b83f07f605d', '631465b0-eca1-47b9-a402-beacae79f7e3', '707f01c0-fe16-43ed-9e4c-836c2bf4bdaf', '71efca32-8228-46c7-9aac-035334d0b0f9', '77a1d39b-acd8-410d-aab9-ea1627897f5d', '78b0ba4b-b8a0-4689-9972-cabab721ab40', '7b5fea58-ea9c-43aa-816d-ead2a44d75a9', '81085974-1b22-4f21-99f7-853c778c6952', '89cff821-69cd-4c46-ba77-07803106de59', '8d454889-0c10-47bb-82ed-d1c61b5fa035', '8f126874-d69e-4edf-9c82-79d14001ea7f', '94bcaebb-25c6-488b-9a81-bc0a150cba42', '94eb862a-db1c-45bd-9f6d-81366b5d6f3d', '9512670d-82f7-4fc3-98d1-e38c0d775d72', '976981a2-44ae-46f2-9add-2d70eb9c4dad', '97fa1c18-05bf-47c9-b72d-5d712b186ccd', '98566869-2013-4766-8c3f-54d195d83ad0', 'a4f8ba35-ef9d-4c26-871f-546d9c966fdb', 'ae3e7593-586f-495f-9416-4b50ed1fcd10', 'b70e047a-8cae-4c74-82a4-a8837565ff66', 'bc2cf756-e424-4940-9172-253362eceda4', 'c3a43f97-43d8-4e88-a203-46bf194bef1c', 'c87e0a89-0fc0-4adc-a0f1-3cba3d9f4cca', 'c8e15550-faf6-43f5-8c49-ead7071e9812', 'cfff3892-760a-4d1a-a8ae-abb924bf9e87', 'd0cb2cfd-0468-433f-b941-9712820ab1e2', 'd15dcf9e-5315-4e9d-8967-aca6d152c461', 'd195be8a-2b38-405d-9dbb-73e9f8a01cbc', 'd28acb36-5766-4c1e-8d57-a55c2630bd90', 'd3e142eb-a5f8-44a8-84f4-087e48526004', 'd673183a-4742-4f87-855b-9330b7ba2650', 'd686fb18-b222-4925-a544-d3d460dc7ff1', 'df2d02c7-26a9-4890-a600-08c4977bdebc', 'e292a647-b983-49b9-a2e2-ab7fb50ce0ce', 'e407acd7-dfcf-4ee8-9140-6726c01abf4e', 'e56a3775-e363-4a91-89bb-3d2ef0db9abb', 'e879d42f-04eb-4a5f-b98b-ae6d9e9a9ba2', 'eaef3acc-e8c0-4445-b071-9d3862d45ab4', 'f505aee1-4b98-4439-b419-3d2be4cd8c52', 'fe6be17a-8ed5-4aed-b21f-33cdb03c599a']",Cost-sensitive sequential three-way decision modeling using a deep neural network ☆,International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,2017
169,"An important issue concerning the use of safety standards in the design of a complex system is the proper evaluation of the risks. The risk is correlated to the probability of failure, then to the failure rate, and it plays a fundamental role in the safety assessment process. This paper focuses on the failure rate evaluation methods adopted by the following functional safety standards: ISO 19014, ISO 25119, and IEC 61508. All of these standards are applicable, respectively, in the earth-moving machinery, in the tractors and machinery for agriculture and forestry, and in the industrial automation fields. As proposed by the standards, the failure rate evaluation depends on the conventional parameters like Mean Time To Failure, Diagnostic Coverage level, and Hardware Categories. Nevertheless, assuming the same value of these parameters, the results obtained adopting the suggested methods from different standards are not always the same. The aim of this paper is to give an analytical approach to calculate, on a common basis, the failure rate starting from a certain set of input parameters. In addition, the approximations are analysed in order to identify the correct assumptions for the proper application of all these ""not exact"" values in each application field.","['Francesco Giuseppe De Rosa', 'Raffaello Cesoni', 'Stefano Genta', 'Paolo Maggiore']",0f1162f4-335c-4ab1-9c19-9cfcef3187cb,0,"['2bfcc04a-c6d4-4a84-9b42-4d09f192bbf3', '2d7cbcf1-9c27-46dd-b059-5dd30a659587', '307adc24-fd7a-449e-b405-ea0169825764', '42551fe4-6ed9-43a0-a40e-3e98a84c5f63', '6729f670-e5ed-4f05-abd0-9c01f7897585', '7f175edb-5800-49e8-a632-6e342edf16e0', '9e8570c0-a575-46d1-b53f-4af49ef9e75a', 'd364c18b-8369-4779-9cf4-f97611fc82ab', 'd71193d4-2a54-47cc-aa33-8e4fbabda5e4']","Failure rate evaluation method for HW architecture derived from functional safety standards (ISO 19014, ISO 25119, IEC 61508)",Reliability Engineering & System Safety,2017
170,"Multiple kernel learning (MKL) is a widely used technique for kernel design. Its principle consists in learning, for a given support vector classifier, the most suitable convex (or sparse) linear combination of standard elementary kernels. However, these combinations are shallow and often powerless to capture the actual similarity between highly semantic data, especially for challenging classification tasks, such as image annotation. In this paper, we redefine multiple kernels using deep multi-layer networks. In this new contribution, a deep multiple kernel is recursively defined as a multi-layered combination of nonlinear activation functions, each one involves a combination of several elementary or intermediate kernels, and results into a positive semi-definite deep kernel. We propose four different frameworks in order to learn the weights of these networks: supervised, unsupervised, kernel-based semi-supervised, and Laplacian-based semi-supervised. When plugged into support vector machines, the resulting deep kernel networks show clear gain, compared with several shallow kernels for the task of image annotation. Extensive experiments and analysis on the challenging ImageCLEF photo annotation benchmark, the COREL5k database, and the Banana data set validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Mingyuan Jiu', 'Hichem Sahbi']",53718c16-5098-4035-8d7d-ce8f98c837a3,50,"['035070d7-d087-41e5-bb5a-e6621738ea48', '03d100b4-54e1-49dd-ad16-23bf3e25cae0', '07277b21-9b35-4b1a-8bc7-7c29766ccd35', '09e2d6a6-8a7d-4182-98a3-8e8e983c34dc', '0cf517ae-e71d-4500-8dc3-2255e7968d77', '15c931f1-4acc-46c4-b691-af3c50b8f60b', '1a37fbdf-91e9-4e28-8de7-d0789d6ef59a', '1d0a0a4e-2992-4f52-9086-93b0b717fb56', '1dd615f4-5fcd-4255-ac90-123c67399b8a', '20f5cdda-0ef9-4b9d-99ae-4e69b21c0b70', '22ebb916-bab4-45ea-80b5-42bea948a7bf', '261aefde-fbe5-494f-afd7-c771aff03127', '2f3c1f28-db7e-4399-ba30-6b8fb1377318', '32c1bdf2-cea7-4d60-8289-2207eaa41a77', '39f4337b-1dcf-400d-80d0-f3cd0929dee3', '4671f8ce-de63-40b9-962d-a2a9fe3c714a', '5ae6fd36-3274-42b0-bb59-d39a1b014a6b', '5d37bdd5-628c-470a-8710-79c8c37d4963', '5e611609-c2e8-444d-96e4-9e30eb7cbfd1', '61c22d7a-cfae-4cd7-a729-3819ec928e64', '62f17af6-9d1c-4708-bd79-e8340c84afa8', '68d74535-e8e3-4b74-ae74-9fd69fc4da87', '690d1120-e86c-4840-a8db-87d4b2edd4d7', '69b0b97d-8c1f-40ba-a78d-ac8dd4546404', '6a323522-b788-407e-b857-4fb19b9f2465', '725ff5fd-76fe-41b4-b50d-00405a51ac27', '7ceafd9f-de9b-4a9c-a601-966d6e33615f', '7dc8df93-b802-4b09-aec1-1d8ebeeadbcf', '8174913d-2c94-4344-9fd5-383246be7cb3', '827ea34a-8b5f-4e39-bf91-361e8dce0d04', '846d232e-f9d4-44dc-b82e-ef5c3602fa21', '84dc3fbb-d57f-4cd0-9261-93816189f070', '89f10062-acf1-4171-b882-f3222c3a357e', '8a09b0c2-daa5-4b0c-9c9b-826f03e1076c', '8a6266e0-b363-46af-ac56-ee5a7ffe7972', '8bc5f80f-af26-47b4-aa0a-aab3a2e6c503', '8dd77317-5db9-4c2e-a14c-29b18ca2fe4d', '904cbad5-94b6-4992-b1fa-4e68c56f18ab', '92b157ad-8174-4b2a-8e1d-dfed8f0f7544', '94898e1d-1e50-41ab-9dcc-2c2e030cddd0', 'a04bef5c-da75-4080-bd9f-d0936029473c', 'a10d6d12-a86f-4813-9dea-1d604c40a894', 'a5e3c7d4-bdc9-46e9-9ebd-044328488842', 'a851d9de-726e-4e0a-a831-a10cb562aa37', 'b80f5d9f-e436-4b28-989a-73cd3b376f10', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'bbcdab6c-1df2-4a81-9c76-6958e9f5a07d', 'bc41219a-ae7f-42da-84ef-9c862c991cf9', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'c4786a0a-872f-4e65-83b7-9e927a2b9863', 'c928ba93-3329-41ee-9b96-6ec0e821c609', 'cab8a651-8e7d-4c24-a4c9-5fab2cd7481d', 'cb5e3b2d-a97e-461f-b99e-d4593d0ef2d7', 'cb7ca132-154e-44bc-89a5-834b89d48630', 'ce3a9a34-d344-4bf4-a437-b013dac7877f', 'd4033783-7634-4272-ad63-dd554bcfc145', 'dc4d94b0-9118-4129-9669-b8d5fc1fc057', 'e083080b-0b2c-4d50-b08c-024694817b09', 'e201aead-709d-4ad8-82f1-e58ced12c080', 'e2f7a74a-8430-4463-94ce-fe85dfd309f9', 'e6133640-d2e5-4c9b-9266-f876ca2e54f1', 'f053143d-9676-4824-9922-c561826bc1d7', 'f05560df-d908-4e07-9c85-0b9761e0b5dd', 'f1232a23-b1ff-4f1b-a9a8-c1ef6abc65fc', 'fe067394-71bd-4593-9208-ebaae36cf2c3', 'ffc50038-8c60-43b7-af78-bf6ba3e2b0d5']",Nonlinear Deep Kernel Learning for Image Annotation,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
171,"Deconvolution is a mathematical process of resolving an observed function into its constituent elements. In the field of biomedical research, deconvolution analysis is applied to obtain single cell-type or tissue specific signatures from a mixed signal and most of them follow the linearity assumption. Although recent development of next generation sequencing technology suggests RNA-seq as a fast and accurate method for obtaining transcriptomic profiles, few studies have been conducted to investigate best RNA-seq quantification methods that yield the optimum linear space for deconvolution analysis. Using a benchmark RNA-seq dataset, we investigated the linearity of abundance estimated from seven most popular RNA-seq quantification methods both at the gene and isoform levels. Linearity is evaluated through parameter estimation, concordance analysis and residual analysis based on a multiple linear regression model. Results show that count data gives poor parameter estimations, large intercepts and high inter-sample variability; while TPM value from Kallisto and Salmon shows high linearity in all analyses. Salmon and Kallisto TPM data gives the best fit to the linear model studied. This suggests that TPM values estimated from Salmon and Kallisto are the ideal RNA-seq measurements for deconvolution studies.","['Haijing Jin', 'Ying-Wooi Wan', 'Zhandong Liu']",32ea6b59-6f1e-4c52-9e00-b13a6bef19a3,50,"['1f9f0252-9589-4a20-8fa2-7f7a19d8a9bf', '3dc998b1-13ae-4c53-bee4-8e18c75c1a21', 'f5eab307-dc5f-4054-a700-aa53910458a1']",Comprehensive evaluation of RNA-seq quantification methods for linearity,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
172,"Information extraction in clinical texts enables medical workers to find out problems of patients faster as well as makes intelligent diagnosis possible in the future. There has been a lot of work about disorder mention recognition in clinical narratives. But recognition of some more complicated disorder mentions like overlapping ones is still an open issue. This paper proposes a multi-label structured Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method for disorder mention recognition. We present a multi-label scheme which could be used in complicated entity recognition tasks. We performed three sets of experiments to evaluate our model. Our best F1-Score on the 2013 Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum data set is 0.7343. There are six types of labels in our multi-label scheme, all of which are represented by 24-bit binary numbers. The binary digits of each label contain information about different disorder mentions. Our multi-label method can recognize not only disorder mentions in the form of contiguous or discontiguous words but also mentions whose spans overlap with each other. The experiments indicate that our multi-label structured SVM model outperforms the condition random field (CRF) model for this disorder mention recognition task. The experiments show that our multi-label scheme surpasses the baseline. Especially for overlapping disorder mentions, the F1-Score of our multi-label scheme is 0.1428 higher than the baseline BIOHD1234 scheme. This multi-label structured SVM based approach is demonstrated to work well with this disorder recognition task. The novel multi-label scheme we presented is superior to the baseline and it can be used in other models to solve various types of complicated entity recognition tasks as well.","['Wutao Lin', 'Donghong Ji', 'Yanan Lu']",ff49fd21-d661-4203-8971-bb7bac70d28a,0,"['013cdde1-aaba-4cc4-95e0-0be1dc96f4e1', '0594d5fb-cfe2-459b-bdc3-184e6d088238', '13ff98cf-0d75-4b84-a3d6-faa4a8502c9b', '150e8cf7-1123-4da1-b211-00f42811e53b', '2237ab73-a42a-4d5d-807c-5ab6e6abbc95', '255a817a-8f71-4721-9fe3-9fc15e35e4da', '2789597e-2c4b-449b-83b5-2ec5518d8ca7', '2f20c9ef-c027-4af0-9c4d-68e74c47727a', '31f54397-343f-4b98-b19e-7600734ed2d1', '446c7847-2ca6-42fc-bc2e-58cf926630de', '4ffd7d10-c575-40e6-a814-0bb4590c8ecb', '5cf21bc5-1d26-4705-9b59-0a6200928a9f', '852d4703-36db-4c8c-814c-6cd2273b536b', '998e48b9-7d74-42c5-ac15-a0cd80c345b0', 'a90bb910-a129-46c1-845d-b5b432c2127b', 'acdc4754-27f2-4dbf-a91c-7af48a42c4cb', 'c186e8f6-42e1-4bb8-8fe3-039e0cd02532', 'ccb88f42-84c9-4ab8-b68d-80985fec5761', 'd0bbf973-4708-42b7-a2a0-04b564023015', 'd7047578-dad6-4bb0-9f49-1ae6e7a8275f', 'f69fd601-57aa-4ca2-8d5c-cb54f1dae6ca', 'fce925f1-9571-4b10-873b-191d48127906']",Disorder recognition in clinical texts using multi-label structured SVM,BMC Bioinformatics,2017

174,"A tandem of particle-based computational methods is adapted to simulate injury and hemorrhage in the human body. In order to ensure anatomical fidelity, a three-dimensional model of a targeted portion of the human body is reconstructed from a dense sequence of CT scans of an anonymized patient. Skin, bone and muscular tissue are distinguished in the imaging data and assigned with their respective material properties. An injury geometry is then generated by simulating the mechanics of a ballistic projectile passing through the anatomical model with the material point method. From the injured vascular segments identified in the resulting geometry, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is employed to simulate bleeding, based on inflow boundary conditions obtained from a network model of the systemic arterial tree. Computational blood particles interact with the stationary particles representing impermeable bone and skin and permeable muscular tissue through the Brinkman equations for porous media. The SPH results are rendered in post-processing for improved visual fidelity. The overall simulation strategy is demonstrated on an injury scenario in the lower leg.","['Kwitae Chong', 'Chenfanfu Jiang', 'Daniel Ram', 'Anand P.

175,"Gene dependency networks often undergo changes in response to different conditions. Understanding how these networks change across two conditions is an important task in genomics research. Most previous differential network analysis approaches assume that the difference between two condition-specific networks is driven by individual edges. Thus, they may fail in detecting key players which might represent important genes whose mutations drive the change of network. In this work, we develop a node-based differential network analysis (N-DNA) model to directly estimate the differential network that is driven by certain hub nodes. We model each condition-specific gene network as a precision matrix and the differential network as the difference between two precision matrices. Then we formulate a convex optimization problem to infer the differential network by combing a D-trace loss function and a row-column overlap norm penalty function. Simulation studies demonstrate that N-DNA provides more accurate estimate of the differential network than previous competing approaches. We apply N-DNA to ovarian cancer and breast cancer gene expression data. The model rediscovers known cancer-related genes and contains interesting predictions.","['Xiao-Fei Zhang', 'Le Ou-Yang', 'Hong Yan']",3d60b551-fc67-4c62-9a44-13b67a703005,0,"['25ba57ce-0d70-41a4-87d1-e51df2f61682', '2662eba3-d02d-477e-bf07-163e88d3cf6d', '29f1bdc5-6edd-4645-966a-bfb6c85f1cea', '3fcbc48b-c7c2-4c97-8258-27ba00490d2f', '48fb649a-cccc-4910-a9f3-fad4a3f18f8d', '4b159d08-b785-472f-8107-2c21eda8f706', '84aaa335-a4da-40f1-8820-69243c4e0fd9', 'bddd776d-9efb-462e-bbce-e16b9d637585', 'c974b624-3d45-427b-8628-a58f70268e50', 'e293878c-5d1f-4fbc-a627-7997606dcc71', 'e537d143-155e-4ca0-8ae8-66b777a77fea', 'ed9eea4e-94a0-4cab-9348-61cc9413e430', 'eed98206-91c7-4d8a-b860-8d5c79c9214b', 'f66af957-b4a8-40f4-b21d-08d98a03a047', 'fd1ed5a8-ca61-47ae-8916-723b57df97c7']",Node-based differential network analysis in genomics,Computational Biology and Chemistry,2017
176,"Textual paralanguage cues (TPC) have been signaled as effective emotion transmitters online. Though several studies have investigated their properties and occurrence, there remains a gap concerning their communicative impact within specific psychological processes, such as the social sharing of emotion (SSE, Rime, 2009). This study content-analyzed Live Journal blogposts for the occurrence of TPC in three phases of online SSE: initiation, feedback and repost. We compared these to TPC on a second type of emotional expression, emotional venting. Based on Social Information processing theory (SIP, Walther, 1992), and on the Emotional Mimicry in Context (EMC, Hess & Fischer, 2013) framework, we study predictive relationships in TPC usage in our phased model of online SSE. Results showed that TPC prevailed in SSE blogposts and strongly dominated in emotional venting posts. TPC was more common in affective feedback than cognitive. Moreover, the presence of tactile affective cues (i.e., hugs, kisses) in the initiation post predicted their presence in affective feedback. Results lend support to the idea that TPC are used in socio-contextual ways in online SSE and particularly extrapolate certain FtF nonverbal behaviors, such as the provision of socio-affective touch.","['Carmina Rodríguez-Hidalgo', 'E.S.H.

It is also known that the classification performance is highly dependent on the size of the labeled data. In this letter, a semisupervised learning-based hyperspectral image classification framework is proposed as a solution to these problems. One of the contributions of this letter is the selection of the initial labeled training samples with a subtractive clustering-based approach, which provides the most informative samples for graph-based self-training. Another contribution is the decision-level combination of results obtained by support vector machines and kernel sparse representation classifiers. Additionally, a combination of the spatial and spectral information by creating a window structure is also proposed via integrating contextual information from the neighboring pixels.

181,"This paper formulates a new approach to the study of chaos in discrete dynamical systems based on the notions of inverse ill-posed problems, set-valued mappings, generalized and multivalued inverses, graphical convergence of a net of functions in an extended multifunction space [Sengupta & Ray, 2000] and the topological theory of convergence. Order, chaos and complexity are described as distinct components of this unified mathematical structure that can be viewed as an application of the theory of convergence in topological spaces to increasingly nonlinear mappings, with the boundary between order and complexity in the topology of graphical convergence being the region in (Multi(X)) that is susceptible to chaos. The paper uses results from the discretized spectral approximation in neutron transport theory [Sengupta, 1988, 1995] and concludes that the numerically exact results obtained by this approximation of the Case singular eigenfunction solution is due to the graphical convergence of the Poisson and conjugate Poisson kernels to the Dirac delta and the principal value multifunctions respectively. In (Multi(X)), the continuous spectrum is shown to reduce to a point spectrum, and we introduce a notion of latent chaotic states to interpret superposition over generalized eigenfunctions. Along with these latent states, spectral theory of nonlinear operators is used to conclude that nature supports complexity to attain efficiently a multiplicity of states that otherwise would remain unavailable to it.",['Amlan K.

To utilize the temporal dependencies, MMSDA first aligns features in sequences from the same class to an adapted number of temporal states, and then, constructs the sequence class separability based on the statistics of these ordered states. To learn the transformation, MMSDA formulates the objective of maximizing the minimal pairwise separability in the latent subspace as a semi-definite programming problem and provides a new tractable and effective solution with theoretical proofs by constraints unfolding and pruning, convex relaxation, and within-class scatter compression. Extensive experiments on different tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of MMSDA.","['Bing Su', 'Xiaoqing Ding', 'Changsong Liu', 'Hao Wang', 'Ying Wu']",4837015d-2022-4273-a530-19a23b1f4912,0,"['001e7824-a551-480b-a59e-b0db45baea80', '00ec14ed-5e79-4d70-ab49-9c295abbb138', '1fbe480d-1ee0-460a-88e5-ed9f77ee97b1', '2b9565d9-7e3d-470f-8978-16c0ee0ab9f2', '3558a6f7-5aa2-4ded-84ae-e9af484e5511', '36630587-825e-4444-9678-ca084b4c73f1', '45910c92-c5fc-4a12-98a2-2e4d574e893c', '53983e98-295f-443c-bb0e-1267f443af40', '5ef9348b-ea4c-4601-a238-bf7195a8a4d3', '6769f0b5-4ffd-462c-8e35-84f41fd2e005', '743bc382-76f7-4a5d-a765-c01ae2eaaef0', '75fc3788-30f3-456f-9065-9094051ee636', '8c3d1242-19b7-4086-bf32-3e03daabf24d', '9500d247-f3a2-45f3-a1ec-fc9e50930c14', '9f87e9e2-40f5-40c1-b62f-6de70c58e4fd', 'a4b0349f-c3e5-4309-84e6-afed682e4143', 'a60b7959-4067-407b-9d78-71c6e207730e', 'ac3001b4-ea98-4046-9be2-71cab8773de2', 'ae829318-5d10-461d-9c99-34a95a3f8732', 'b22e2b60-5299-4d7e-a559-5d8966801c1c', 'b3410414-ffe0-4766-a45f-dc30e969f68d', 'b36cfda5-5b10-40ec-a5de-56774e5c55ba', 'b7e8861c-0c3e-477c-97f7-72993b969105', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'ba4fa6d8-7af8-430b-bf05-1f1d249b3d01', 'c78d10a2-3325-40cb-a3e3-7d79ff443f31', 'cb822708-460e-4dad-8ce1-bb3a63579799', 'cf6cadce-963c-466f-8b66-5fe90fcc2f9f', 'e1ed30ba-442a-47b4-b053-1f8bb0d5b45f', 'e537d143-155e-4ca0-8ae8-66b777a77fea', 'e621b712-f8f9-4169-b2fb-be6c905658cf', 'ed48df88-183a-4075-9008-3487c0086239', 'fb310677-6bdc-4d98-b30c-22f75a0fd955']",Discriminative Transformation for Multi-Dimensional Temporal Sequences,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
183,"Information systems (IS) research usually investigates phenomena at one level of analysis at a time. However, complex IS phenomena may be difficult to address from such a single-level perspective. A multilevel perspective offers an alternative means to examine phenomena by simultaneously accounting for multiple levels of analysis. Although useful guidelines for theory development are widely available, they give little specific attention to developing theory that is conceptualized and analyzed at multiple levels. Multilevel theorizing or developing theory from a multilevel perspective is more complex and involves unique challenges. To promote multilevel theorizing in the IS discipline, we focus on addressing challenges involved in multilevel theorizing and propose a holistic framework for systematically developing theory from a multilevel perspective.

184,"ABSTRACTThe work presented in this paper seeks to address the tracking problem for uncertain continuous nonlinear systems with external disturbances. The objective is to obtain a model that uses a reference-based output feedback tracking control law. The control scheme is based on neural networks and a linear difference inclusion (LDI) model, and a PDC structure and H∞ performance criterion are used to attenuate external disturbances. The stability of the whole closed-loop model is investigated using the well-known quadratic Lyapunov function. The key principles of the proposed approach are as follows: neural networks are first used to approximate nonlinearities, to enable a nonlinear system to then be represented as a linearised LDI model. An LMI (linear matrix inequality) formula is obtained for uncertain and disturbed linear systems. This formula enables a solution to be obtained through an interior point optimisation method for some nonlinear output tracking control problems.

185,"Dictionary learning has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional hybrid coding framework. However, the rigid structure of sequential training and prediction degrades its performance in scalable video coding. This paper proposes a progressive dictionary learning framework with hierarchical predictive structure for scalable video coding, especially in low bitrate region. For pyramidal layers, sparse representation based on spatio-temporal dictionary is adopted to improve the coding efficiency of enhancement layers with a guarantee of reconstruction performance. The overcomplete dictionary is trained to adaptively capture local structures along motion trajectories as well as exploit the correlations between the neighboring layers of resolutions. Furthermore, progressive dictionary learning is developed to enable the scalability in temporal domain and restrict the error propagation in a closed-loop predictor. Under the hierarchical predictive structure, online learning is leveraged to guarantee the training and prediction performance with an improved convergence rate. To accommodate with the state-of-the-art scalable extension of H.264/AVC and latest High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), standardized codec cores are utilized to encode the base and enhancement layers. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the latest scalable extension of HEVC and HEVC simulcast over extensive test sequences with various resolutions.","['Wenrui Dai', 'Yangmei Shen', 'Hongkai Xiong', 'Xiaoqian Jiang', 'Junni Zou', 'David Taubman']",938cb4a6-01d1-4994-9866-8dc85141ed63,0,"['109a35de-49dd-4353-b4ea-37d6f36792d6', '112e5417-1603-427a-b14b-0bfedf3d139f', '1516816b-4842-40cf-abe4-610e5b1789b3', '1dfb7854-cc8c-4567-87cd-b27d0c788dfb', '2b774ffd-7d44-4684-abc9-aa198df7a2b1', '32ac4ea1-7ea6-48ad-98dc-c36457a9151b', '33b6847b-ea2c-4627-90fc-2dfa90bb4911', '37bedaeb-a14d-40f8-90b9-76fb7399734a', '37e7860f-a963-4b7c-bda2-a0f543b9871e', '3841a242-27f8-4a05-b85f-384c187089ff', '3bad2ddc-b6e6-4053-a909-63fbcd144f2f', '3ec4365b-7717-45fd-9ca3-3ddf99c31b01', '44a5d9fe-65a8-4391-b746-b5cca8a803ea', '4ca0b31e-527d-4471-8566-7c5067d2b912', '5fe6a6c3-301d-4de1-a24e-080b4c7feaed', '67b2b3cd-7c5d-4b5f-b301-d6e1bd857ec1', '6879da4f-8478-49eb-b62f-ab5b35d68930', '6957a675-f240-46ab-9422-6ce68206e1d9', '698b7ccc-e7ca-4746-ae07-c8edb10b26f0', '77273092-15f9-444d-90a4-99a76f021675', '7ed7b5da-c666-4dc0-8243-a1d3ce0456d7', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '800b7740-51b7-440e-87fd-bf8073df81b2', '8b2387e6-518b-4c6b-b5f1-2cc9cfe23f57', '94e25efe-d596-4767-99f0-d87f8c950f0c', '9bbd171a-07b4-45a0-8fb8-9f89fdb7f599', '9bd00024-b302-407e-92af-5d62759757bd', '9d91f152-3a13-484b-b5b0-aca806dafde8', 'aecf8a08-eff7-4182-8bbb-a7b29de2f281', 'd02a4255-dff3-4cdf-ba69-41bd09a48ead', 'd4734a42-017a-4d7c-937c-f9cd6f0e9ba5', 'daa6cdfc-9933-4b5b-84c3-08bc66875de9', 'de43281c-fd0b-4ad2-a7b9-1810da7ad424', 'e99b42ac-6b17-4932-b0fe-3c2d19e2e9e6', 'f38e78a5-878d-499d-86c8-0a02ba099f22', 'ff3e8103-1378-408b-adc2-c42b1c25b065']",Progressive Dictionary Learning With Hierarchical Predictive Structure for Low Bit-Rate Scalable Video Coding,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
186,"Robot teleoperation systems face a common set of challenges including latency, low-dimensional user commands, and asymmetric control inputs. User control with Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) exacerbates these problems through especially noisy and erratic low-dimensional motion commands due to the difficulty in decoding neural activity. We introduce a general framework to address these challenges through a combination of computer vision, user intent inference, and arbitration between the human input and autonomous control schemes. Adjustable levels of assistance allow the system to balance the operators capabilities and their perception of control authority. Additionally, a custom servo controller design allow for safe interactions of the robotic arm with the environment. We present experimental results demonstrating significant performance improvement using our shared-control assistance framework on adapted rehabilitation benchmarks with two subjects at various timepoints relative to their implantation with intracortical BCIs. Our results indicate that shared assistance mitigates perceived user difficulty in using a seven-degree of freedom robotic arm as a prosthetic and enables successful performance on previously infeasible tasks. We showcase the extensibility of our architecture with applications to quality-of-life tasks such as opening a door, pouring liquids from containers, and manipulation with objects previously unknown to the system in densely cluttered environments.","['Katharina Muelling', 'Arun Venkatraman', 'Jean-Sebastien Valois', 'John E.

First, we propose a preprocessing algorithm that reduces the problem size by eliminating customers and network arcs that are irrelevant for the current horizon. Second, we develop a decomposition method that divides the problem into two subproblems. The upper level subproblem considers a simplified vehicle routing problem to minimize the distribution cost while satisfying minimum demands, which are calculated based on consumption rate, initial inventory and safety stock. In the lower level, a detailed schedule with drivers is acquired using a continuous-time MILP model, by adopting the routes selected from the upper level. Finally, an iterative approach based on the upper and lower levels is presented, including the addition of different types of integer cuts and parameter updates. Different options of implementing this iterative approach are discussed, and computational results are presented.","['Yachao Dong', 'Christos T. Maravelias', 'Jose M.

188,"The identification of critical states is a major task in complex systems, and the availability of measures to detect such conditions is of utmost importance. In general, criticality refers to the existence of two qualitatively different behaviors that the same system can exhibit, depending on the values of some parameters. In this paper, we show that the relevance index may be effectively used to identify critical states in complex systems. The relevance index was originally developed to identify relevant sets of variables in dynamical systems, but in this paper, we show that it is also able to capture features of criticality. The index is applied to two prominent examples showing slightly different meanings of criticality, namely the Ising model and random Boolean networks. Results show that this index is maximized at critical states and is robust with respect to system size and sampling effort. It can therefore be used to detect criticality.","['Andrea Roli', 'Marco Villani', 'Riccardo Caprari', 'Roberto Serra']",f294f4d3-c070-4d48-b2f9-3268de6fa3eb,50,"['4bd5bec7-f354-4e01-a501-efee969caef9', '79cf1822-821f-4513-a230-adfdcd12d49a', '9971c8fc-4fe3-494a-ae77-eb6a9c82e6f2', 'a8399530-9e8f-45f8-aaa2-32140a7284aa', 'b3f6ff68-e68f-4390-8f3e-b35da77852c3', 'f294cdd8-78ee-4c12-ab7f-df62f486ca69']",Identifying Critical States through the Relevance Index,Entropy,2017
189,"Patent applicants and examiners do not always have the same point of view when conducting a prior-art search. Although several studies have suggested differences between citations by applicants and examiners, the data and range of empirical studies are too incomplete to generalize the characteristics of relationships between citation types and the value of a technology or invention. To overcome this limitation, it is crucial to compare citations by applicants and by examiners in depth, with diverse perspectives and data, to determine the value of patent information for technological innovation. Thus, this paper suggests that the differences in the composition of technical information and patent quality in patent-level investigations as well as the locus of the knowledge source and knowledge recentness in knowledge-level investigations according to patent citation type (by applicants and examiners) reflect Pavitt’s perspective on the nature, impact, and source of technological innovation. We found that the quality of patents cited by applicants is higher than that of those by examiners in four industries, excluding a supplier-dominated industry. The citation types are related to the locus of the knowledge source in four industries, excluding the supplier-dominated industry. In particular, the patents cited by examiners tended to be more recently issued in all sectoral fields.

191,"This paper presents a robust data authentication scheme for protecting data integrity and availability in unattended wireless sensor networks. Such networks are vulnerable to several types of attacks. In particular, attackers can compromise a subset of nodes and use these nodes to transmit modified data or to prevent genuine data from being verified. The presented scheme combines security against data modification and denial of service attacks with traffic and storage efficiency. This is achieved by involving all sensor nodes in the network in the authentication process, implementing cooperative authentication with multiple authenticators, and using dual storage. Detailed analysis and extensive simulation tests show that our scheme achieves better performance compared to related schemes published in the literature in terms of traffic, storage, security against DoS attacks, and security against data replacement attacks.",['Mostafa H.

192,"Let $J$ and $J^*$ be subsets of $\mathbb{N},$ such that $0,1\in J$ and $0\in J^*$. For infinitely many $n$, let ${\boldsymbol{k},},=(k_1,\ldots, k_n)$ be a vector of nonnegative integers whose sum $M$ is even. We find an asymptotic expression for the number of multigraphs on the vertex set $\{1,\ldots, n\},$ with degree sequence given by ${\boldsymbol{k},},$ such that every loop has multiplicity in $J^*$ and every nonloop edge has multiplicity in $J$. Equivalently, these are symmetric integer matrices with values $J^*$ allowed on the diagonal and $J$ off the diagonal. Our expression holds when the maximum degree $k_{\mathrm{max},},$ satisfies $k_{\mathrm{max},}, = o(M^{1/3},)$. We prove this result using the switching method, building on an asymptotic enumeration of simple graphs with given degrees [B. D. McKay and N. C. Wormald, Combinatorica, 11 (1991), pp. 369--382].

193,"This paper presents an improved signal reconstruction method based on a new inverse short-time Fourier transform (ISTFT) estimator. The main challenge addressed in this study is to design a more computationally efficient algorithm called exact formal approach (EFA) which overcomes the drawbacks of the popular overlap and add (OLA) and least squares (LS) methods in several cases of practical interest. The proposed EFA algorithm is based on a vector formulation and the exploitation of properties of the matrix formed by signal samples and frames corresponding to signals segments with overlap. A detailed comparative study shows the advantages of the EFA compared to the OLA and LS methods. Several experiments illustrate the performance and properties of the different estimators. The criteria of comparison are based on synthesis quality and denoising efficiency. The results indicate that, (1) from a computational point of view, the proposed algorithm EFA outperforms other popular ISTFT algorithms including OLA and LS and (2) that the EFA and LS have similar results in terms of synthesis quality and both outperform the algorithm currently most used for ISTFT, the OLA. The proposed EFA estimator can then improve ISTFT based applications involving signal enhancement and denoising.","['Samir Ouelha', 'Sami Touati', 'Boualem Boashash']",92dc52ec-5c53-4336-8657-fbafcb698d97,0,"['02fb4cda-96af-443d-b83e-1d05e3a413da', '11410ec4-0c96-4ac7-b382-1e818440d2ef', '2562e64a-d133-4450-8e1c-55d7bf45e88e', '38024655-c6a2-4662-9284-5193b3ae58e6', '543faf58-1fda-42cd-aaa5-076d6ae4b618', '561350d3-c249-4c3c-89b8-ed3e5f0a7aa1', '5bb7422f-e1f5-4cde-850a-8f9bde80d32c', '5e50682c-a706-4f97-96f5-12f0dd9c851a', '60c24138-c41f-447d-9ce2-b38d39e92728', '746d7e8f-fbef-4447-8d8d-99f0d45da65a', '8153221f-b274-489c-8998-b15ea1eaeedf', '8610bc56-e536-402c-b334-179fa17ecd1c', '9f96e563-4e86-405c-b15c-a7aa8d20456c', 'a370b550-0f92-493b-b4da-b153768b4119', 'c292e047-4deb-4575-ba0a-fe51c8799393', 'c998eaf4-bb88-4efb-863e-c7ce7c384905', 'd0cdae49-bd69-4558-8d98-bc9701f3c9bd', 'dd3155e3-7313-4a4d-a109-6366361e9dc0']",An efficient inverse short-time Fourier transform algorithm for improved signal reconstruction by time-frequency synthesis: Optimality and computational issues,Digital Signal Processing,2017

195,"Multi-robot conflict resolution is a challenging problem, especially in dense environments where many robots must operate safely in a confined space. Centralized solutions do not scale well with the number of robots in dynamic scenarios: a centralized communication can cause bottlenecks and may not be robust enough when channels are unreliable; the complexity of algorithms grows with the number of robots, making online re-computation too expensive in many situations. In this work, we propose a decentralized approach for conflict resolution where robots show reactive and safe behaviors, avoiding collisions with both static and dynamic objects, even under unreliable communication conditions and with low resources. They detect conflicts with neighboring obstacles locally and then apply rules to surround them in a roundabout fashion, assuming that others will follow the same policy. The method is designed for unicycle robots with range-finder sensors, and it is able to cope with noisy sensors and second-order dynamic constraints, ensuring always collision-free navigation. Besides, a set of metrics and scenarios for benchmarking in multi-robot collision avoidance are proposed. We also compare our method with others from the state of the art through extensive simulations. Experiments with real robots are also presented in order to show the feasibility of the system.","['Eduardo Ferrera', 'Jesús Capitán', 'Ángel Rodriguez Castaño', 'Pedro José Marrón']",9db43f45-7ea8-4e7e-a5d3-f60b9f1f8b3c,0,"['01a1b768-11f7-450d-be08-f0457c8c3e41', '057ea084-6430-4650-82f4-33e1736892d0', '06d6d73b-7fcd-44b1-9509-0a897f7eeb0e', '0c4d598d-6f47-4472-a9e3-8beec36af9f7', '22a247bf-610b-42d0-9ef2-704ff51f4273', '270ef758-396d-43b8-9922-285e003aa331', '34e49b6a-87ce-48a5-b876-143799493dd6', '3f070a8d-7346-4c13-bc03-51aa0e2c1b9c', '42a26477-e284-4596-a25d-40a78def2cbf', '47e55db9-4cbf-418d-bda5-cf577008eab7', '55460523-88f1-462a-b3be-02875bdcccc5', '5c59ae91-c520-46e5-b381-1fef3212b49c', '643e6167-f638-4cbb-b43f-d39817e53449', '66bb8ec4-c00e-45d0-b930-066cff3e8585', '6ae2a285-0b2b-4cb6-ba39-11534e423ed7', '70d48984-74ec-437d-aea9-9fb357766d7b', '81613ca4-af0f-4b8d-aa30-80b119a7cb42', '8f453f0d-d119-4171-b5d0-9fde40380499', '9e08e3bc-e554-4950-90ba-319f533599b4', '9ec09e86-5397-479a-b9fb-656f475f1626', '9f018602-4456-4c31-a047-6026b4c0c814', 'a0939e32-6d5e-4e9d-b7df-c324d1cc71b1', 'b45b0889-3961-4f07-a110-8b5fe12271c8', 'd19bb340-0233-4550-a9a0-300eab0f6cbe', 'd60242aa-5ff0-4bb1-98e5-591f63ddfc85', 'eb51a018-7cb1-4278-af2e-387c80b52c64']",Decentralized safe conflict resolution for multiple robots in dense scenarios,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2017
196,"Advances in storage and networking technologies have made on-demand multimedia services prevalent these days. To provide numerous concurrent users with such high-quality services, it is essential for storage systems to support sufficient I/O bandwidth for delivering multimedia data on time. Two data buffering techniques,  prefetching  and  interval caching , have improved I/O performance by keeping data blocks in memory for future accesses when handling multimedia data with sequential access patterns. However, they have been addressed separately since it is challenging to determine whether it is better to prefetch or to cache each new stream depending on specific situations. Prefetching too many blocks or caching too long intervals may exhaust the cache space quickly. In this paper, we propose a scheme, called  Integrated Prefetching/Caching  (IPC), to simultaneously take benefit of both prefetching and interval caching using dynamic threshold values. The IPC schedules incoming streaming requests so that utilization of both cache space and disk bandwidth can be maximized. As a result, the IPC can continue to improve the performance without saturation as system resources are added. By simulation experiments, we show that IPC increases the number of concurrent streams significantly, compared to when either prefetching or caching is employed alone.","['Eunsam Kim', 'Jonathan C.

Although many CNNs have been proposed in the literature, their design is empirical. In the design of the VCNN, we propose a feed-forward K-means clustering algorithm to determine the filter number and size at each convolutional layer systematically. For the analysis of the VCNN, the cause of confusing classes in the output of the VCNN is explained by analyzing the relationship between the filter weights (also known as anchor vectors) from the last fully-connected layer to the output. Furthermore, a hierarchical clustering method followed by a random forest classification method is proposed to boost the classification performance among confusing classes. For the application of the VCNN, we examine the 3D shape classification problem and conduct experiments on a popular ModelNet40 dataset.

201,"To alleviate high energy dissipation of unnecessary snooping accesses, snoop filters have been designed to reduce snoop lookups. These filters have the problem of decreasing filtering efficiency, and thus usually rely on partial or whole filter reset by detecting block evictions. Unfortunately, the reset conditions occur infrequently or unevenly (called  passive filter deletion ). This work proposes the concept of revitalized snoop filter (RSF) design, which can actively renew the destination filter by employing a generation wrapping-around scheme for various reference behaviors. We further utilize a sampling mechanism for RSF to timely trigger precise filter revitalizations, so that unnecessary RSF flushing can be minimized. The proposed RSF can be integrated to various existent inclusive snoop filters with only a minor change to their designs. We evaluate our proposed design and demonstrate that RSF eliminates 58.6% of snoop energy compared to JETTY on average while inducing only 6.5% of revitalization energy overhead. In addition, RSF eliminates 45.5% of snoop energy compared to stream registers on average and only induces 2.5% of revitalization energy overhead. Overall, these RSFs reduce the total L2 cache energy consumption by 52.1% (58.6% -- 6.5%) as compared to JETTY and by 43% (45.5% -- 2.5%) as compared to stream registers. Furthermore, RSF improves the overall performance by 1% to 1.4% on average compared to JETTY and stream registers for various benchmark suites.","['Yin-Chi Peng', 'Chien-Chih Chen', 'Hsiang-Jen Tsai', 'Keng-Hao Yang', 'Pei-Zhe Huang', 'Shih-Chieh Chang', 'Wen-Ben Jone', 'Tien-Fu Chen']",3ac045db-136f-451d-aed8-790116ec88df,0,"['11317b62-c333-4ae2-8faa-fa5d1322bf76', '1b3653dc-e810-49c8-8854-ac74f8edb8bb', '2026c7a6-48f5-4c05-8988-7f465adfaa22', '2d3cdf02-6de5-4632-aeee-e174e61ee243', '3260525c-21ed-48b7-a169-e0170a459700', '370c62f4-f2a1-40f8-ab9b-8918064ca86c', '447c7e50-c61c-434e-aa53-0dad0b6b8ac3', '469ed5a6-7c72-4289-b5eb-e7694640facd', '9fb50991-7073-401e-a738-fd8a328359bf', 'a4f95e3a-17b0-46ed-a588-341d2bc53a33', 'af422c8a-88d9-466d-b45c-cb57c9a9ca76', 'be74d7c1-87cf-4193-b27b-aef5ea71e821', 'cfce707e-3bf3-4390-8f06-4fae87adf144', 'e2ef5649-f83b-4274-a731-98af5f384f97', 'ed0ac60f-0239-4610-a34b-b6933d5d2d9d', 'f7e7ca9d-467f-448e-aa99-2dfd4935a8ed']",Leak Stopper: An Actively Revitalized Snoop Filter Architecture with Effective Generation Control,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,2017

203,"Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have recently emerged as a dominant paradigm for machine learning in a variety of domains. However, acquiring a suitably large data set for training DCNN is often a significant challenge. This is a major issue in the remote sensing domain, where we have extremely large collections of satellite and aerial imagery, but lack the rich label information that is often readily available for other image modalities. In this letter, we investigate the use of DCNN for land–cover classification in high-resolution remote sensing imagery. To overcome the lack of massive labeled remote-sensing image data sets, we employ two techniques in conjunction with DCNN:  transfer learning  (TL) with fine-tuning and  data augmentation  tailored specifically for remote sensing imagery. TL allows one to bootstrap a DCNN while preserving the deep visual feature extraction learned over an image corpus from a different image domain. Data augmentation exploits various aspects of remote sensing imagery to dramatically expand small training image data sets and improve DCNN robustness for remote sensing image data. Here, we apply these techniques to the well-known UC Merced data set to achieve the land–cover classification accuracies of 97.8 ± 2.3%, 97.6 ± 2.6%, and 98.5 ± 1.4% with CaffeNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, respectively.","['Grant J.

This is a necessary step towards unified access to biological data sets, but this still requires solutions to query multiple endpoints for their heterogeneous data to eventually retrieve all the meaningful information. Suggested solutions are based on query federation approaches, which require the submission of SPARQL queries to endpoints. Due to the size and complexity of available data, these solutions have to be optimised for efficient retrieval times and for users in life sciences research. Last but not least, over time, the reliability of data resources in terms of access and quality have to be monitored. Our solution (BioFed) federates data over 130 SPARQL endpoints in life sciences and tailors query submission according to the provenance information.

This paper presents our vision and ongoing work to achieve this goal for a new high-performance flash file system, called BilbyFs. BilbyFs is carefully designed to be highly modular, so it can be verified against a high-level functional specification one component at a time. This modular implementation is captured in a set of domain specific languages from which we produce the design-level specification, as well as its optimised C implementation.

206,"This paper presents a novel hybrid time-to-digital converter (TDC) for high resolution and wide range time measurement, where a two-stage TDC cooperates with a two-step TDC. First the input time is roughly converted by a coarse-fine two-stage TDC to guarantee wide dynamic range and small quantization error. Then the residual time from the previous conversion is obtained by an extraction circuit and further quantified by a two-step TDC for ultra fine resolution, where the extracted residue is linearly enlarged by a time amplifier (TA), followed by adopting a tapped delay line with original gate delay resolution for measurement. The TA is regulated by delay-locked-loop (DLL) to keep its gain stable under process, voltage and temperature variations.

207,"To reduce the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal, a novel nonlinear companding transform (CT) scheme is proposed in this paper. This scheme can reallocate both the amplitude/power as well as statistical distribution of the companded signal more reasonably and flexibly than existing CT methods with low computational complexity. By choosing an appropriate companding parameter, it can provide more effective PAPR reduction but at the price of a minimal amount of bit-error-rate (BER) performance degradation caused by the companding distortion. The closed-form expressions including the achievable PAPR gain, signal attenuation factor, and corresponding selection criteria for the companding parameter were derived. Computer simulations demonstrate that the scheme significantly improves the overall performances of OFDM system in terms of PAPR, BER and bandwidth efficiency under the multipath fading channel or with the high power amplifier.","['Yong Wang', 'Lihua Wang']",ff0d5305-1bf8-479f-991e-59c19985dcf3,0,"['21985161-d282-4415-b6e0-e6ffb7957745', '33a6aef2-5f80-44d3-9a5e-339dfb4b7beb', '340c28be-3263-4bc7-a72b-3dce3d368a70', '53744b32-70dd-4fb6-bc91-1fcadffb8ddc', '8418bdbc-1322-4ce8-9c80-c98d3872131e', '9cce003c-90b2-4ef5-b09a-f8d7a039a061', 'b76ee4b4-edb3-4ad1-b366-36cb2b4ec762', 'b78796d0-3e78-4010-8f79-dd7df2fef0a8', 'bbb41ae5-0edb-44ec-b2df-821b999c5a5e', 'e41af714-8cb0-474c-b472-014f3b06189c', 'ed276a69-35b5-49d4-bf6a-771df3e7f668', 'f5673f63-8cc0-489e-afb0-7ab2858b89cf']",Transforming the Statistical Distribution of Wireless OFDM Signal for PAPR Reduction,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

This letter examines the target detection problem for a passive multistatic radar, where the receivers are contaminated by nonnegligible noise and direct-path interference (DPI). The signal transmitted from the IO is treated as a deterministic but unknown process. A generalized likelihood ratio test approach is proposed, where the    $\mathcal {H},_1$   estimation problem is solved using an iterative method. A clairvoyant matched filtering detector, which assumes the knowledge of the IO waveform, is provided as well to benchmark performance.

210,"Software-Defined Storage (SDS) is an evolving concept for the management of data storage from the software's perspective. Multi-tenant applications running on the cloud can benefit from the concepts introduced by SDS by managing the allocation of data storage from the tenant's perspective. A multi-tenant application should guarantee both data separation and performance isolation towards every tenant, and migration of tenant data over time should be minimized as this is both an expensive and time consuming operation. Furthermore, with cloud computing compliance with regulatory policies regarding the storage of data remains a key hurdle, as end users often have no way to specify their requirements.#R##N##R##N#In this article, we present a dynamic and extensible system for the management of storage resources in multi-tenant cloud applications. In the presented approach, tenants are hierarchically clustered based on multiple scenario-specific characteristics, and allocated to storage resources using a hierarchical bin packing algorithm (static allocation). As the load changes over time, the system corresponds to these changes by reallocating storage resources when required (dynamic reallocation). We evaluate both the static and dynamic behavior of our system. Experiments confirm that the system achieves good results regarding the average bin usage, migrations over time and clustering of related tenants. On average, less than 0.01% of the total amount of data is reallocated during each migration using the dynamic Hierarchical First-Fit Decreasing (dHFFD) algorithm while achieving an average bin usage similar to First-Fit Decreasing (FFD). The dynamic Hierarchical Greedy Decreasing (dHGD) algorithm reduces the number of migrations by a factor 100 compared to dHFFD, but at the cost of provisioning additional storage instances.","['Pieter-Jan Maenhaut', 'Hendrik Moens', 'Bruno Volckaert', 'Veerle Ongenae', 'Filip De Turck']",2da801e1-46da-4e3f-a25e-229a1979c9f7,0,"['15fc63ce-4895-457e-b0ee-ddd39e4f497e', '3174f9aa-b9c0-4731-910c-b0a3af770e44', '44bc8854-1750-4d74-933a-1582d142752a', '45605a14-3390-4d40-a83e-73b4c36df19e', '46ba1987-b551-4204-8520-ed283c88aaec', '535a9b2c-26b1-4f2a-91ff-2b95bab05247', '556565f3-6f52-4106-b2e5-2b36e208c109', '59055386-d647-4e8f-ad2f-f1a1d34f071f', '653c7770-d2bf-430d-bdd7-59e05e15b4ce', '67610fc8-fa0e-4b14-a203-c6f5d7f055df', '80dae984-c31d-4371-9839-b2a93fd7d1eb', '8d6d9be0-585c-49f4-9482-1b6d952a2d12', '919edf32-e258-4ab6-853b-b9d4156f5ae0', '96aa1975-0848-459c-82f4-ed8fcd041327', 'a9194fe1-ae6d-49c8-9df6-da0b23a3dafe', 'c280811e-70a7-4734-83a5-41d789a284d8', 'c65f6e9e-24ca-4cd8-b808-98fa885bc3ae', 'cf114c34-991c-4690-b34c-af3ecfd8a39d', 'd0a0e3e6-7798-4f2a-a81e-533671f5b98b', 'e405f73a-3d9b-419e-9498-acc70da6deb3', 'fa55fdad-2c02-4f64-a0b1-53ddbedca51e']",A Dynamic Tenant-Defined Storage System for Efficient Resource Management in Cloud Applications,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017
211,"In this paper, a new estimation of distribution algorithm is introduced. The goal is to propose a method that avoids complex approximations of learning a probabilistic graphical model and considers multivariate dependencies between continuous random variables. A parallel model of some subgraphs with a smaller number of variables is learned as the probabilistic graphical model. In each generation, the joint probability distribution of the selected solutions is estimated using a Gaussian Mixture model. Then, learning the graphical model of dependencies among random variables and sampling are done separately for each Gaussian component. In the learning step, using the selected solutions of each Gaussian mixture component, the structure of a Markov network is learned. This network is decomposed to maximal cliques and a clique graph. Then, complete Bayesian network structures are learned for these subgraphs using an optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization problem is a 0–1 constrained quadratic programming which finds the best permutation of variables. Then, sampling is done from each Bayesian network of each Gaussian component. The introduced method is compared with the other network-based estimation of distribution algorithms for optimization of continuous numerical functions.","['Latifeh PourMohammadBagher', 'Mohammad Mehdi Ebadzadeh', 'Reza Safabakhsh']",bc4b07ab-fd6e-49d9-9a2f-9eed954824f4,0,"['0571edd1-2998-42c3-a67f-d4899f849e7c', '0f2c6dbd-eb40-4ee8-84d5-bf1544e0e690', '14724289-2ff5-41e1-ba4f-030fa4bd498e', '163fc0c9-af78-4d0a-9325-1ed1eaf4be07', '19b42594-6913-4fa3-b2bd-a1aafd77a686', '221273bf-f26b-4171-93df-861fe558ff77', '2b081f98-8ac5-457b-89a0-bc21a77865b3', '2d032539-3a12-4d9c-8723-cbb593b7b4ec', '2e7b64e7-f4f4-42a6-9c04-7e2b354e137a', '3118d387-f1cb-49dc-ae21-7aec21cc7ea1', '3488e4fa-9751-42c2-bbfb-7ab54b0a505f', '36cac15a-4308-4d72-af54-581cd64bb44f', '37a9e2f5-edd7-4d36-a01a-5adda693a5a7', '3a42b957-befe-4e2e-b27a-0e121033a72f', '607cbe73-4581-4099-a03b-8012e3c4ee32', '6f5441c5-3681-4a32-9e34-b1dd3901e711', '75e20289-fcb8-412e-9548-8ffe81a9d38e', '7e6ffad1-8c4e-4903-bfce-0b32b6245b9d', '83d83e22-d66d-4615-9ab2-79b0b6182ecd', '893c1865-a009-41b1-b6d1-c7dad5de4e75', '9ce7b128-e001-477f-aa48-3ae710f34103', 'a8146c80-d1a2-4d06-866b-719dd4048e8c', 'a90ad812-2d0d-4bed-a802-b1377346ee04', 'b1bb612f-46f8-4f2a-9268-1f5150e7a6d4', 'b2768221-0935-46da-8bf4-c27bfdbfc5bd', 'bc19c906-ec4a-4132-b894-f521c908c7ce', 'be91e684-cf2e-457f-95e5-791a0a89d3fc', 'd279c935-f553-4dcc-aa8f-8b6c1c82c7ac', 'd85fb16f-9e7d-409f-9133-bffc8a57508a', 'd91a4957-b299-44eb-9dfd-50b8f27f022f', 'da1723ed-86b3-41cd-8cf0-172c03be71e2', 'e20f6795-2a1e-4ffb-bfcf-f044f02adce7', 'eb67c40d-674c-4229-80d0-9da8965c506d', 'ecfb8865-75c4-40c9-8e2a-0b448617f6ff', 'fdbb0c65-8b80-43e7-a839-8738e03cd72e']",Graphical model based continuous estimation of distribution algorithm,Applied Soft Computing,2017
212,"Many methods have recently been proposed for subspace clustering, but they are often unable to handle incomplete data because of missing entries. Using matrix completion methods to recover missing entries is a common way to solve the problem. Conventional matrix completion methods require that the matrix should be of low-rank intrinsically, but most matrices are of high-rank or even full-rank in practice, especially when the number of subspaces is large. In this paper, a new method called Sparse Representation with Missing Entries and Matrix Completion is proposed to solve the problems of incomplete-data subspace clustering and high-rank matrix completion. The proposed algorithm alternately computes the matrix of sparse representation coefficients and recovers the missing entries of a data matrix. The proposed algorithm recovers missing entries through minimizing the representation coefficients, representation errors, and matrix rank. Thorough experimental study and comparative analysis based on synthetic data and natural images were conducted. The presented results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective in subspace clustering and matrix completion compared with other existing methods.","['Jicong Fan', 'Tommy W. S.

213,"Packet classification is one of the most challenging functionalities performed by routers at wire-speed for every incoming packet. For search spaces composed of multiple rules represented geometrically, various space decomposition algorithms have been studied to provide effective search methods. While an area-based quad-trie (AQT) provides a simple and intuitive way of mapping the geometrical search space into a two-dimensional (2-D) trie structure, it does not provide high-speed classification performance because the mapping is incomplete. This paper proposes the application of leaf-pushing into the 2-D trie to improve the classification performance of the AQT. The leaf-pushing AQT provides a more effective method of searching rules covering each input packet in the decomposed space. We also discuss an efficient implementation technique for our algorithm using a Bloom filter and a hash table. Simulation results show that our proposed leaf-pushing AQT improves the packet classification performance up to 37 times for sets with up to 100,000 rules compared with the AQT. To be compared with other space decomposition algorithms, a refined structure of the leaf-pushing AQT is also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed refined structure provides an effective space decomposition method as well as the balance between memory requirements and classification speed, while most of other space decomposition algorithms show a trade-off between them.","['Jung-Won Lee', 'Ha Young Byun', 'Ju Hyoung Mun', 'Hyesook Lim']",f3dd1220-924c-478c-a961-e0bc67175793,0,"['0a50a0a9-439e-43c0-aaa3-561fce1cd16f', '17fe5a88-477d-4961-993c-f104b16673a4', '21afde09-1d97-42d0-9d6e-c2236e729700', '2af17a6e-e4b9-4099-b819-dd7dbf405424', '38d55967-5a13-4d2f-b77f-49e54c113a08', '3c8affd4-7591-401f-9329-17eb0a607ace', '3de250a3-d830-4fb8-b772-21aead391fe4', '3e264060-f0b5-4d9b-b026-99972e548022', '52d9bab7-d4c9-4593-8522-d85b1c7010fa', '53916e36-5777-4185-8dc1-5d4aceb011f4', '53cfcf16-38cc-45e7-be90-9cec5bf3300f', '5a34e0b6-bf50-4dd0-b02e-676c4f2fa7d2', '65698354-8ff0-4060-a798-acdbf507ac84', '6be8fa5d-6ed7-4e39-a0ea-973414628bee', '6d141dd2-de0a-411a-8925-62b18e4540fd', '712ab861-3614-49d7-bec8-dd3b8c568bdd', '73194bf7-7195-4ab7-8d23-1d6fe0074a6c', '7893fa74-03fb-4d3f-af7e-b916cfd4aead', '78af7514-b115-4303-bc40-e1c1ce8ad01f', '7974fb69-a4b8-4f97-a78f-14efe7cd18ce', '89893efa-a393-4562-9eab-bf20eda1dbab', '919c9cf0-2b22-4e2f-b5e8-f485885f3113', '936436df-93a3-469c-b3ed-cc144e0e9a45', '9f7c1cd2-696b-4188-af71-12d9034b6798', 'a2d5a9bf-7131-4033-96a5-dc4acfc29d73', 'b78b7c9e-8de5-4eca-824b-56487e805d30', 'b7ee4f64-9b69-48e7-9d8f-e8abff86406c', 'bccc35e0-3745-4ee8-95be-8f5253564d60', 'bdbe12b5-5e5a-4454-884f-6da318bb3762', 'cd394efc-4c6b-47d3-a258-813ae8820481', 'ce7864bf-a812-4064-8b6e-9911a52bb4db', 'd1198ebe-465b-47df-87eb-5f2eb855acc5', 'd5d6375e-75c1-429a-935b-982ddb7a2c14', 'd7649360-48de-4ca2-8203-e13715e566bc', 'd9f6651b-4373-4875-ae20-422185302c97', 'dabfeda2-4c17-411d-a32a-b02e40404593', 'dd4fe4cb-b693-4ba9-aba1-fd858c3961b5', 'e74fc4b3-3bbf-4e35-9298-f11b6305bc78', 'e909edca-a4bd-4fe4-9a5c-e1d4c5249be0', 'eefaf0c7-2661-4993-9200-4f76f6a7ef58', 'f8040412-c378-493d-a963-3f65917dbdca']",Utilizing 2-D leaf-pushing for packet classification,Computer Communications,2017
214,"Abstract Nucleosomes are implicated in transcriptional regulation as well as in packing and stabilizing the DNA. Nucleosome positions affect the transcription by impeding or facilitating the binding of transcription factors. The DNA sequence, especially the periodic occurrences of dinucleotides, is a major factor that affects the nucleosome positioning. We analyzed the Drosophila DNA sequences bound by H2A and H2A.Z nucleosomes. Periodic patterns of dinucleotides (weak–weak/strong–strong or purine–purine/pyrimidine–pyrimidine) were identified as WW/SS and RR/YY nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) patterns. The WW/SS NPS pattern of the H2A nucleosome has a 10-bp period of weak–weak/strong–strong (W = A or T; S = G or C) dinucleotides. The 10-bp periodicity, however, is disrupted in the middle of the sequence. At the dyad, the SS dinucleotide is preferred. On the other hand, the RR/YY NPS pattern has an 18-bp periodicity of purine–purine/pyrimidine–pyrimidine (R = A or G; Y = T or C) dinucleotides.

215,"In usual real-world clustering problems, the set of features extracted from the data has two problems which prevent the methods from accurate clustering. First, the features extracted from the samples provide poor information for clustering purpose. Second, the feature vector usually has a high-dimensional multi-source nature, which results in a complex cluster structure in the feature space. In this paper, we propose to use a combination of multi-task clustering and fuzzy co-clustering techniques, to overcome these two problems. In addition, the Bregman divergence is used as the concept of dissimilarity in the proposed algorithm, in order to create a general framework which enables us to use any kind of Bregman distance function, which is consistent with the data distribution and the structure of the clusters. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can overcome the two mentioned problems, and manages the complexity and weakness of the features, which results in appropriate clustering performances.","['Alireza Sokhandan', 'Peyman Adibi', 'Mohammadreza Sajadi']",8bc05f1d-75a4-4760-ba57-6f09de7963fb,0,"['06dc0648-62ce-4357-8fb5-9d0dbd83faed', '142e7b62-35e3-4cf3-9e7c-6f975a8b3741', '16d4392b-7898-43cd-b61b-a6b5105ce1f0', '1e1a16f3-f848-4092-82b1-910711dca315', '35bdd13f-00e1-4f3a-9040-cb930450792f', '38c92a85-293f-435e-8236-011100adb804', '420b652d-96a8-4251-a21b-8642e6e1f5f1', '42b270f3-c508-4ee5-acfb-863453242248', '4566b061-5720-468e-97b9-f32a343a598b', '4586e9af-a6c9-4e50-b117-9f2c51c1bbef', '551c5b1a-ce05-4dab-bb89-3eb9462c77d7', '553e0315-ef6e-4e0f-9c5a-14ee31e41edc', '58c240bd-0c4e-432b-8095-4dd7383a8a27', '7460d9d7-ab83-45a3-aaf7-05b46dc603fb', '78c21a46-6b2e-40fd-8ab4-302a53682989', '89db90e1-86af-4250-828a-606b79a7461e', '8f7a3200-0763-4624-885c-4ecf9cdb38a2', '94b095a5-74ad-47ec-a39d-8dc877b2ef1e', '972adf05-2513-448a-8620-3cd93abd2c01', '99fd5a0e-d8a4-4c64-b2ba-41d20ff8fca2', '9ca1cc54-32df-44b3-b5ad-a9523405f265', 'a33ecf94-01a7-4850-8d82-0c87b78c70af', 'a793c997-c5f0-4aaa-b588-5d30645a1838', 'a9afbe32-a800-4f02-84b6-cb66661a9621', 'b946f944-cae5-4347-bc56-b8e6bbedd805', 'c19a8325-68e9-4fde-8c58-cc7367d5a716', 'c7efebbf-137a-4176-a256-f1ffce37a440', 'cfff133e-b0ae-4098-bc35-d520f41dede5', 'd51e893e-7adb-4131-bd09-dc926fc52a40', 'd9369d18-a07c-4993-8429-1f748325c9fb', 'dce1b26f-c828-4856-8749-ca4b6f91385c', 'de723746-6328-4202-9cbb-892292d63d80', 'e075ef26-a336-4898-9e4c-dd7b62a179c7', 'f64717bb-b43e-4c1e-a7da-7504e2055af6', 'f8c1fafc-29e2-4037-af85-c23efef3e4b7', 'fa9665e1-9de5-47d3-8047-c244b5455a53', 'fe4ad877-0597-4efd-a3ce-16346991cbc1']",Multitask fuzzy Bregman co-clustering approach for clustering data with multisource features,Neurocomputing,2017
216,"Abstract  Objective  We present the implementation and application of a case-based reasoning (CBR) system for breast cancer related diagnoses. By retrieving similar cases in a breast cancer decision support system, oncologists can obtain powerful information or knowledge, complementing their own experiential knowledge, in their medical decision making.  Methods  We observed two problems in applying standard CBR to this context: the abundance of different types of attributes and the difficulty in eliciting appropriate attribute weights from human experts. We therefore used a distance measure named weighted heterogeneous value distance metric, which can better deal with both continuous and discrete attributes simultaneously than the standard Euclidean distance, and a genetic algorithm for learning the attribute weights involved in this distance measure automatically. We evaluated our CBR system in two case studies, related to benign/malignant tumor prediction and secondary cancer prediction, respectively.  Result  Weighted heterogeneous value distance metric with genetic algorithm for weight learning outperformed several alternative attribute matching methods and several classification methods by at least 3.4%, reaching 0.938, 0.883, 0.933, and 0.984 in the first case study, and 0.927, 0.842, 0.939, and 0.989 in the second case study, in terms of accuracy, sensitivity×specificity, F measure, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, respectively.  Conclusion  The evaluation result indicates the potential of CBR in the breast cancer diagnosis domain.","['Dongxiao Gu', 'Changyong Liang', 'Huimin Zhao']",aa30489e-707c-441d-ac1f-c8c736928977,0,"['04ac6975-76e2-40cc-a635-d227fd74ddd5', '07b59118-d453-44e0-9abc-cf15a32ab67a', '16512277-bc79-4069-b141-004c181cee41', '19ffa729-cf4a-4426-933a-58f4eb9dbab3', '1bd5aacd-7c4d-45aa-bdcf-a298300000ef', '332b3c33-0120-4106-9ebe-6fa84ae07286', '363e06f0-e4ad-4f6f-bbd9-72df753c3be4', '40cebdc4-cdfa-45c7-80fc-6f465aefda57', '40d034a3-be7a-4c8e-8524-bb7562809415', '424fd8cf-ec3e-4b3f-90bd-d01f194ecded', '4ec36265-5224-4162-8c3a-aba0d36d2a23', '5e7c68f3-0869-4d0a-b586-403c7354da90', '629cc81f-4cb7-4ce2-81f5-41edc650a213', '66c5269e-d948-4de6-9715-1e467460592c', '6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3', '716702c2-dce9-436f-8505-3cf9b6c629a9', '7583b6d0-44bd-444e-a311-4c537015a77d', '7ab9aa1f-0234-4665-9176-610e812ff685', '85687541-b244-4844-8570-2f950d7d9442', '8bb5c4df-e43d-4a9a-9e53-7387a10af055', '8da3beb9-2bd1-47fd-83f3-4cd6484388af', '9ccded82-340e-4306-899b-ab8166fdbfa0', 'a8ac8bff-e4ec-41f6-b3f5-f3fe0a4f2372', 'b3ff82d9-8979-498d-bdec-bcd2d10a3997', 'bac39a03-c92d-4104-b98b-af829e5cdc6d', 'bc28301c-c91d-42e4-a76e-38a5d203cedb', 'c18addea-e9ec-42c2-b589-5e1b2eea4604', 'c49953fc-f581-41ce-b503-d13c9369e181', 'cbc86c1e-62e6-482a-b5e6-7f4f1bcde48b', 'ce67b15c-8d9c-4a3d-8858-bf117326e4fb', 'cf929351-2da3-4959-9ecf-8d51d5fa15bf', 'd422956e-b1d4-4731-94b8-acd7e0347b90', 'd9da23bb-1c0d-45b8-b874-7d410a50924f', 'e1f2da14-cbea-4fa8-88ac-84f485b0c954', 'e4209f92-6f22-406c-9d10-10ebccb8bbc2', 'e8330c2a-72b9-4623-9fbc-38fcab47c296', 'e887b595-e1ed-43b3-a36f-730b75a8624e', 'e8deddcd-ce5d-4bf3-b244-002e8c70df61', 'f7227044-d970-4388-9a8c-a2fddf49382a', 'f77583a0-2bec-4620-a305-cfa8a6979815']",A case-based reasoning system based on weighted heterogeneous value distance metric for breast cancer diagnosis,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,2017
217,"Retailers must define their assortments and assign shelf space to the items included in these assortments. These two planning problems are mutually dependent if space is scarce. We formulate a model that maximizes a retailer’s profit by selecting the optimal assortment and assigning limited shelf space to items. This model is the first decision model to integrate assortment and shelf-space planning by considering stochastic and space-elastic demand, out-of-assortment and out-of-stock substitution effects. To solve the model, we develop a specialized heuristic that efficiently yields near-optimal results, even for large-scale problems. We show that our approach outperforms alternative approaches, e.g. a sequential planning approach that first picks assortments and then assigns shelf space by up to 18%, and a greedy algorithm by up to 16% in terms of profit.#R##N##R##N#We test our model on two real data sets for perishable and non-perishable items and show how it can support retailers in increasing their profits by up to 25%.

Using our model, we finally derive rules-of-thumb for planners in practice.","['Alexander Hübner', 'Kai Schaal']",39c4d3ee-f79d-4f56-8c6d-299860524c3d,0,"['017236ce-75b0-4028-b37b-ed10f914b3ef', '1eed2de7-b6ae-4459-986d-d43491a1d257', '26d6fb28-7094-47bd-9712-fd50ecd01890', '659ac9aa-540a-48e9-8dc5-c0200c2ca99e', 'a2aa9b6b-a10f-4429-853a-240c40d7b289', 'bf142a85-9876-4d63-88eb-2bfa3b464643', 'cadfcf37-d54a-4de2-9477-0959d8e1ac6a', 'cb11ce48-6927-4626-b0f0-b017e62a0019', 'e452ce50-fc4a-4de6-bd3a-5856c75f1216', 'f767825a-61a2-488f-8725-7cabd5e1ae8f']",An integrated assortment and shelf-space optimization model with demand substitution and space-elasticity effects,European Journal of Operational Research,2017

Specifically, global and domestic IP portfolios for bio-AM innovations are studied using the proposed method. First, the domain documents (of US patents and MOST projects) are collected from a global patent database and MOST project database. The key term frequency counts and technical clustering analysis of the collected documents are derived. The key terms and appearance frequencies in documents form the basis for document clustering and similarity analysis. The ontology of bio-AM is constructed based on the clustering results. Finally, the patents and projects in the adjusted clusters are subject to evolution analysis using concept lattice analysis.

219,"This paper introduces the Flexible Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (FPVRP) where a carrier has to establish a distribution plan to serve his customers over a planning horizon. Each customer has a total demand that must be served within the horizon and a limit on the maximum quantity that can be delivered at each visit. A fleet of homogeneous capacitated vehicles is available to perform the services and the objective is to minimize the total routing cost. The FPVRP can be seen as a generalization of the Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) which instead has fixed service frequencies and schedules and where the quantity delivered at each visit is fixed. Moreover, the FPVRP shares some common characteristics with the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) where inventory levels are considered at each time period and, typically, an inventory cost is involved in the objective function. We present a worst-case analysis which shows the advantages of the FPVRP with respect to both PVRP and IRP. Moreover, we propose a mathematical formulation for the problem, together with some valid inequalities. Computational results show that adding flexibility improves meaningfully the routing costs in comparison with both PVRP and IRP.","['Claudia Archetti', 'Elena Fernández', 'Diana L.

A matrix is further defined to design state feedback controllers. Based on the matrix set, state feedback controllers can be obtained quickly and the computational complexity can be reduced. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the design procedure of pinning controllers.","['Rongjian Liu', 'Jianquan Lu', 'Jungang Lou', 'Ahmed Alsaedi', 'Fuad E.

221,"Background#R##N#TSPO translocator protein, encoded in humans by the Tspo gene plays a crucial role in mitochondria mediated apoptosis and necrotic cell death through its association with Mitochondrial Permeability Transition pore (MPTP). It has been shown that this function can be exploited as a potential treatment for human Glioblastoma Multiforme. In this study, a novel robust fragment based QSAR model has been developed for a series of 4-phenylquinazoline-2-carboxamides experimentally known to be ligands for TSPO, thus triggering apoptotic mechanism cascade.#R##N#Results#R##N#Model developed showed satisfactory statistical parameters for the experimentally reported dataset (r2 = 0.8259, q2 = 0.6788, pred_r2 = 0.8237 and F-test = 37.9). Low standard error values (r2_se = 0.253, q2_se = 0.34, pred_r2_se = 0.14) confirmed the accuracy of the generated model. The model obtained had 4 descriptors, namely, R1-Volume, R2-SsCH3E-index, R3-SsCH3count and R5-EpsilonR. Two of them had positive contribution while the other two had negative correlation.#R##N#Conclusion#R##N#The high binding affinity and the presence of essential structural features in these compounds make them an ideal choice for the consideration as potent anti-GBM drugs. Activity predicted by GQSAR model reinforces their potential as worthy candidates for drugs against GBM. The detailed analysis carried out in this study provides a substantial basis for the prospective design and development of novel 4-phenylquinazoline-2-carboxamide compounds as TSPO ligands capable of inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.","['Debolina Goswami', 'Sukriti Goyal', 'Salma Jamal', 'Ritu Jain', 'Divya Wahi', 'Abhinav Grover']",d8d55963-298f-4188-898a-d2bcb66e606f,0,"['800dc1c5-7d48-4904-a313-0f02c5c3017b', 'fc8eb819-1261-44b0-8016-4a9a5247d41e', 'fd91cf0c-049e-45bf-8659-7e93fe7cc8b6']",GQSAR modeling and combinatorial library generation of 4-phenylquinazoline-2-carboxamide derivatives as antiproliferative agents in human Glioblastoma tumors,Computational Biology and Chemistry,2017
222,"This paper presents the design and implementation of an adaptive-repetitive visual-servo control system for a moving high-flying vehicle (HFV) with an uncalibrated camera to monitor, track, and precisely control the movements of a low-flying vehicle (LFV) or mobile ground robot. Applications of this control strategy include the use of high-flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision for monitoring, controlling, and coordinating the movements of lower altitude agents in areas, for example, where GPS signals may be unreliable or nonexistent. When deployed, a remote operator of the HFV defines the desired trajectory for the LFV in the HFV’s camera frame. Due to the circular motion of the HFV, the resulting motion trajectory of the LFV in the image frame can be periodic in time, thus an adaptive-repetitive control system is exploited for regulation and/or trajectory tracking. The adaptive control law is able to handle uncertainties in the camera’s intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The design and stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is presented, where Lyapunov stability is shown. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for controlling the movement of a low-flying quadcopter, demonstrating the capabilities of the visual-servo control system for localization (i.e.,, motion capturing) and trajectory tracking control. In fact, results show that the LFV can be commanded to hover in place as well as track a user-defined flower-shaped closed trajectory, while the HFV and camera system circulates above with constant angular velocity. On average, the proposed adaptive-repetitive visual-servo control system reduces the average RMS tracking error by over 77% in the image plane and over 71% in the world frame compared to using just the adaptive visual-servo control law.","['Dejun Guo', 'Joseph R.

225,"Information-centric networking (ICN) is a future Internet architecture with the potential to solve myriad issues arising from traditional Internet architecture. By providing in-network caching of content, ICN provides for efficient delivery of content, such as streaming video, that occupies most of the bandwidth and resources of the Internet. Named data network (NDN) is a promising ICN architecture that supports video streaming (both live and on-demand) but does not fully exploit the full potential of in-network caching. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for pre-caching, based on the popularity, chunks of large content objects, such as videos, once they are requested by a consumer. We provide for collaboration in caching between neighboring content routers (CRs) in mesh networks, keeping the cache capacity constraints of CRs in mind. We characterize pre-caching as an optimization problem in which the goal is to jointly minimize the number of hops from the caching node to the consumer and the number of replicas, while observing the cache capacity of each CR. We implement and empirically evaluate each of the schemes and find substantially better than the existing NDN-based schemes.","['Muhammad Faran Majeed', 'Matthew N.

226,"Recordings of stage performances are easy to capture with a high-resolution camera, but are difficult to watch because the actors' faces are too small. We present an approach to automatically create a split screen video that transforms these recordings to show both the context of the scene as well as close-up details of the actors. Given a static recording of a stage performance and tracking information about the actors positions, our system generates videos showing a focus+context view based on computed close-up camera motions using crop-and zoom. The key to our approach is to compute these camera motions such that they are cinematically valid close-ups and to ensure that the set of views of the different actors are properly coordinated and presented. We pose the computation of camera motions as convex optimization that creates detailed views and smooth movements, subject to cinematic constraints such as not cutting faces with the edge of the frame. Additional constraints link the close up views of each actor, causing them to merge seamlessly when actors are close. Generated views are placed in a resulting layout that preserves the spatial relationships between actors. We demonstrate our results on a variety of staged theater and dance performances.","['Moneish Kumar', 'Vineet Gandhi', 'Rémi Ronfard', 'Michael Gleicher']",c83e28bb-7f1e-47f0-b014-f2a169c2c693,0,"['38491cf5-ff58-42a8-9b50-77bcf01164b3', '74d1835f-b144-4ac9-a5ec-225253c78cca', '77c94fb9-f093-459b-9867-01d030e2cb6d', 'ac694b7b-7678-41fd-ace4-58ac62163bba', 'b627088e-3b9c-48dc-83de-ef5b55a81fa2', 'b6faca6a-559e-4e72-8c7a-e9c4fd4d1a4f', 'cb1329e0-d483-47a8-8bac-db933e0bd595']",Zooming on all Actors: Automatic Focus+Context Split Screen Video Generation,Computer Graphics Forum,2017

However, given the diverse availability, uncertainty and Level of Details of these data and the resources required to collect them, managing data quality is a common challenge of urban energy modeling. Knowing the influences of the different input data for different configurations and applications enables to control the result accuracy and recommend intelligent and adequate data collecting strategies, by assigning resources on the most important parameters. This paper investigates the influences of geometrical, meteorological, semantic and occupancy related data quality on the heating demand estimated by the urban energy simulation platform SimStadt, applied to the City of Ludwigsburg in Germany. A focus on a district with consumption data available at building block level allows for a critical comparison between estimated and measured energy demands.

An improved discrete space-vector modulation (DSVM) technique is utilized to synthesize a large number of virtual voltage vectors. The deadbeat (DB) technique is used to optimize the voltage vector selection process, avoiding enumerating all the feasible voltage vectors. With this proposed method, only three voltage vectors are tested in each predictive step. Based on the improved DSVM method, the three candidate voltage vectors are calculated by using a novel algebraic way. This new strategy has the benefits of both the MPTC method and the DB method.

230,"This paper considers a method for improving physical layer security of wireless networks with full-duplex radio. In particular, fast algorithms are developed to compute power allocations in subcarriers, subject to power and rate constraints, to maximize the secrecy capacity of a three-node network consisting of a source, a full-duplex destination, and an eavesdropper. A residual level of radio self-interference channel is considered. The optimal power allocation at the destination is found to be significant especially when its power budget is high. Also studied in this paper are a network with multiple full-duplex destinations and another network with multiple sources. Using the algorithms developed in this paper, we are able to show that a multiuser strategy that optimizes the power distributions among the users (in terms of either the sources or the destinations) can yield a substantial gain of secrecy capacity over a single-user strategy.","['Lei Chen', 'Qiping Zhu', 'Weixiao Meng', 'Yingbo Hua']",e15aecb6-632f-46d2-9c8a-3c41d5c2d40a,0,"['01e00c35-240c-4f1c-8362-1fa38015a8e4', '074010f5-c7a0-4eb5-b484-0c7ce8feacca', '0db1943a-a868-46df-8f41-07d2f22b9277', '2a403eaf-17b9-49a8-be32-095ce9d7fd85', '3b605293-024f-47fe-8863-84be391a7f50', '499cf001-3213-4d42-87a0-f1bc819d52d9', '55594ad8-dec8-4874-a5f4-2e6abe465928', '5898348a-b35c-4ecf-9d22-cbd840a5d41c', '611f3851-ac69-40a4-9e1c-3a752833d778', '690ba260-0355-49d0-85ac-a8ebd91ded14', '6cac89ff-530d-488f-bfa7-6011b9c9f130', '73cce002-b15a-4f08-8ffb-1b02946f2af6', '751202f8-9308-4fa0-b2e9-17a7d05ec014', '805d394d-460b-4405-909a-7ad6bd3b5ea2', '89c9d4ca-2852-485c-9b44-7ccb6712134d', '92779d65-e7db-4ea0-86ef-2650f2b06344', '9b3bc987-f353-43b7-bb2c-61bc50df5a0d', '9dbd7523-9179-4301-931e-d9fb8a90f925', 'a197f028-a9c8-472e-9603-a4dc96b8b447', 'b0c1f056-5ef9-462c-8e83-fac140d91fbc', 'ca5114f8-241b-4e42-8ac7-16896e0b4531', 'd3625d69-55d8-4b94-bb16-df1c5575525d', 'ddb352c0-2390-45fa-950c-778397272ce1', 'e08f4568-4b89-4139-9a4b-6e6084de7565', 'eb3448ea-2c58-474b-9999-cf6e1a2d04d0', 'eedafecd-0bfd-48a6-bd60-5a34cd0f28c6', 'fbaf13cf-0602-46eb-8848-77b60e4c6505']",Fast Power Allocation for Secure Communication With Full-Duplex Radio,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2017
231,"Abstract  Background  mHealth (mobile health) services are becoming an increasingly important form of information and communication technology (ICT) enabled delivery for healthcare, especially in low-resource environments such as developing countries like Bangladesh. Despite widespread adoption of mobile phones and the acknowledged potential of using them to improve healthcare services, the adoption and acceptance of this technology among the elderly is significantly low. However, little research has been done to draw any systematic study of the elderly's intention to adopt mHealth services.  Objective  The aim of this study was to develop a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and then empirically test it for determining the key factors influencing elderly users' intention to adopt and use the mHealth services.  Methods  A face-to-face structured questionnaire survey method was used to collect data from nearly 300 participants of age 60 years and above from the capital city of Bangladesh. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method, a statistical analysis technique based upon Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).  Results  The study determined that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, technology anxiety, and resistance to change (p 0.05).  Conclusions  This study confirms the applicability of UTAUT model in the context of mHealth services among the elderly in developing countries like Bangladesh. It provides valuable information for mHealth service providers and policy makers in understanding the adoption challenges and the issues and also provides practical guidance for the successful implementation of mHealth services. Additionally the empirical findings identify implications related to the design and development of mHealth services that influence potential users. Furthermore, due to a generic approach, the findings of this study could be easily modified to assist other developing countries in the planning and up-take of mHealth services.","['Rakibul Hoque', 'Golam Sorwar']",84e14702-9b3f-4268-a855-f7f033d40432,50,"['08b1f59d-cb25-4eb6-a7d7-1cc26b377c6d', '0ffbba6a-4711-4e10-ad37-358bd8cb6873', '1119c619-3650-46ce-8e35-f8d90d72f60d', '1480e400-2f62-4329-86ea-c2df4007f9c3', '1ef4f66f-4bf5-4911-a007-24e4348d3c83', '2b47d05a-bf0a-49be-a3d0-d231e1da9817', '34261169-6ab0-463c-897b-08a9f79d825e', '37428676-ffd8-4fac-b082-18be07f162d7', '39a3eb5f-a555-45f0-aa2a-b9d748857252', '3f9e1424-2d4e-40b0-aa99-627f05971375', '459f3ce2-c51a-49d6-8c2a-67582cbd19c3', '47c82421-9b92-4c8c-9a6b-04a96215f34d', '5c334fe2-8f3c-4cca-8f54-82b051f64ab2', '6627b93a-043e-4a3d-bfaf-13c196e647de', '70f60706-4a18-452b-8cf2-de90cd87ef52', '75215ad2-6435-4be6-a243-4d552c166c1d', '8928657b-dfd4-4f29-908e-a6ac3d3e012b', '941a8ab9-e761-47b2-84e1-5296f40aebb3', '9a6ed03e-6f5a-4576-8435-ca713c735550', '9f39b6a1-8c65-472f-b4e2-d17e6eabe1b0', 'a5fbe9f7-3d5d-4e02-9b9b-2e4518516aeb', 'b041a572-0db6-49fa-a07c-092147eed5bb', 'b239e39b-829b-4a41-92ad-d4202f726cf6', 'bddb2d4a-09e1-4d1d-8f6e-fe57e084dee0', 'c20f4970-640b-4981-91e3-4162d94ac597', 'c3554f48-4197-4e08-8394-2262d6bde878', 'ca2b7b8f-ae55-4785-824d-2545089af23a', 'd54931ac-2359-4b9b-baaa-602e390e663b', 'da96bbd9-56c1-4ded-a978-6cabc06c1144', 'dc5b7ee4-117b-4352-84dd-dff9597befeb', 'df7e8268-6d23-4fd2-9a4c-5efa407fa9bb', 'e208567a-f5bc-4002-91d6-85bd733cfe28']",Understanding factors influencing the adoption of mHealth by the elderly: An extension of the UTAUT model,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2017

233,"Dislocations are among the most important defects in determining the mechanical properties of both conventional alloys and high-entropy alloys. The Peierls–Nabarro model supplies an efficient pathway to their geometries and mobility. The difficulty in solving the integro-differential Peierls–Nabarro equation is how to effectively avoid the local minima in the energy landscape of a dislocation core. Among the other methods to optimize the dislocation core structures, we choose the algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization, an algorithm that simulates the social behaviors of organisms. By employing more particles (bigger swarm) and more iterative steps (allowing them to explore for longer time), the local minima can be effectively avoided. But this would require more computational cost. The advantage of this algorithm is that it is readily parallelized in modern high computing architecture. We demonstrate the performance of our parallelized algorithm scales linearly with the number of employed cores.","['Zongrui Pei', 'Markus Eisenbach']",2b51511a-a578-4d41-99b0-597716378cbd,0,[],Acceleration of the Particle Swarm Optimization for Peierls–Nabarro modeling of dislocations in conventional and high-entropy alloys ☆,Computer Physics Communications,2017
234,"In this paper, the state estimation problem is studied for the bidirectional associative memory (BAM) fuzzy cellular neural networks (FCNNs) with delays, where the delays include leakage and unbounded distributed delays. The problem addressed is to estimate the neuron states, through available output measurements, such that for all admissible leakage and unbounded distributed delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is globally asymptotically stable. A delay-dependent linear matrix inequality (LMI) criterion for the existence of the estimator is proposed by using the Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method. In addition, the unknown gain matrix is determined by solving a delay-dependent LMI. Finally, numerical examples and simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.","['Kuru Ratnavelu', 'M.

Moreover, the multiple SAR image matching methods have recently gained a lot of attention due to the fact that they can obtain more accurate, better distributed, and more reliable matches than the stereo matching methods. In this letter, we present an improved multi-image matching method to simultaneously identify matches from multiple SAR amplitude images. The proposed method makes better use of the relationships between the pixels in the deformed correlation window and integrates geometric and radiometric information from multiple SAR images. Experiments on Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping Synthetic Aperture Radar (CASMSAR) data sets demonstrate that the improved multi-image matching method is capable of providing more accurate and better distributed matches, as well as offering a better multi-image matching solution in stereo-radargrammetry under the conditions of geometric and radiometric distortions, especially in low-texture areas.","['Hao Ding', 'Jixian Zhang', 'Guoman Huang', 'Jianjun Zhu']",212c33de-0aa4-40a3-bad6-d0de9affca0b,0,"['0ae441f1-571a-436a-9604-c262cd481d3c', '20f6bd3b-0146-4e03-8716-2a9e6f2d9bdc', '25588a99-0b3a-425c-8b69-21d79bf292ea', '5853d1a9-94b4-4f9d-a076-99be1f7cd6bb', '5e146681-068f-47b8-99b9-90589f85109c', '9a968720-a467-4c9e-b38e-37ac62cd1b64', 'd7e13adb-7528-4222-9b79-7649469702cd']",An Improved Multi-Image Matching Method in Stereo-Radargrammetry,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
237,"In data-driven prognostic methods, prediction accuracy of bearing remaining useful life (RUL) mainly depends on the performance of bearing health indicators, which are usually fused from some statistical features extracted from vibration signals. However, many existing bearing health indicators have the following two shortcomings: (1) many statistical features do not have equal contribution to construction of health indicators since the ranges of these statistical features are different; (2) it is difficult to determine a failure threshold since health indicators of different machines are generally different at a failure time. To overcome these drawbacks, a recurrent neural network based health indicator (RNN-HI) for RUL prediction of bearings is proposed in this paper. Firstly, six related-similarity features are proposed to be combined with eight classical time-frequency features so as to form an original feature set. Then, with monotonicity and correlation metrics, the most sensitive features are selected from the original feature set. Finally, these selected features are fed into a recurrent neural network to construct the RNN-HI. The performance of the RNN-HI is verified by two bearing data sets collected from experiments and an industrial field. The results show that the RNN-HI obtains fairly high monotonicity and correlation values and it is beneficial to bearing RUL prediction. In addition, it is experimentally demonstrated that the proposed RNN-HI is able to achieve better performance than a self organization map based method.","['Liang Guo', 'Naipeng Li', 'Feng Jia', 'Yaguo Lei', 'Jing Lin']",aaa5d9f4-7830-4c78-a4cb-ec3bfe8dda73,50,"['04766e01-034a-4579-b086-93dd69aa8519', '062b10c0-c833-4888-b820-52db97e5e57f', '248fb571-6a30-4d47-827e-04918a377b0e', '2cdd767a-a827-466f-a5fb-79384bd0fa18', '3f1b1e8b-7c67-42d9-bb93-c8f164edec76', '4242b6b7-9385-4aef-b693-355902eb4574', '4a41db26-a8ce-4e01-ad54-beb2da77c367', '4fe1f366-ccf3-4a9e-a8c0-acd7e4164b23', '5176163d-298c-4cb8-a15b-4c3e7aa8500b', '75ff63ad-725b-417f-8e7f-09c3d0493252', '8d4928a3-b1e7-4c18-8f0f-7c3de5553d2e', '9179dd1a-77b6-4562-8dc6-ccef67e92eb3', '9265af7c-e643-4f2e-921f-3fac3ab74f6c', '9aa3689c-1150-4888-a79b-b014d8dd11a0', '9ab085b8-b8aa-47d8-9806-10ee8b2f103a', 'a577cf35-2780-4fcf-9e2f-e67946e4f2b1', 'b7f999c6-df73-403a-acb5-9ee34ecb085a', 'c674cecd-8ce2-4bcd-b026-cbdb41ce2c6f', 'ccfc1c83-1e85-4cbe-ab96-998d740646ae']",A recurrent neural network based health indicator for remaining useful life prediction of bearings,Neurocomputing,2017
238,"Multi-vehicle motion planning (MVMP) refers to computing feasible trajectories for multiple vehicles. MVMP problems are generally solved in two ways, namely simultaneous methods and joint methods. An inherent difference between both types of methods is that, simultaneous methods compute motions for vehicles all at once, while joint methods divide the original problem into parts and combine them together. The joint methods usually sacrifice solution quality for computational efficiency, and the simultaneous methods are applicable to simple or simplified scenarios only. These defects motivate us to develop an efficient simultaneous computation method which provides high-quality solutions in generic cases. Progressively constrained dynamic optimization (PCDO), an initialization-based computation framework is proposed to ease the burdens of simultaneous computation methodologies when they are adopted to solve the MVMP problems.

239,"The concept of need is central to the non-market allocation of many public resources, although the definition of need to serve as a basis for such resource allocation often remains contested. This study uses a discrete-choice experiment to investigate the general public’s interpretation of need in the context of health care resource allocation, focusing on three commonly cited definitions of need: need as a person’s baseline health status; need as a person’s ability-to-benefit; and need as the amount of resources required to exhaust a person’s ability-to-benefit. Analysis of participants’ need judgments using a latent-class, rank-ordered conditional logit model reveals that most individuals draw on all three definitions when assessing need, and that here is heterogeneity in interpretations of need among the public. Baseline health status is the most influential and consistent determinant of need, while ability-to-benefit and resources-required-to-exhaust-benefit are considered jointly. However, while some assign greater need to those who are worse off in the sense that they have little ability-to-benefit and require large amounts of resources to achieve that benefit, others assign greater need to those who have greater ability-to-benefit and whose benefit can be achieved with small amounts of resources. The public’s reasoning about need contrasts sharply in a number of ways with the types of arguments offered in the literature on needs-based resource allocation.","['Jeremiah Hurley', 'Emmanouil Mentzakis', 'Mita Giacomini', 'Deirdre DeJean', 'Michel Grignon']",3645a9b4-43cd-4634-ac9d-128a3e7c4c21,0,"['6d0779f6-642f-4abf-a847-289d41c49369', 'e0063a0e-5d1f-4828-b081-a34c4ef8aa9f']",Non-market resource allocation and the public’s interpretation of need: an empirical investigation in the context of health care,Social Choice and Welfare,2017
240,"In this paper, we present the combination of our soft supernumerary robotic finger i.e. Soft-SixthFinger with a commercially available zero gravity arm support, the SaeboMAS. The overall proposed system can provide the needed assistance during paretic upper limb rehabilitation involving both grasping and arm mobility to solve task-oriented activities. The Soft-SixthFinger is a wearable robotic supernumerary finger designed to be used as an active assistive device by post stroke patients to compensate the paretic hand grasp. The device works jointly with the paretic hand/arm to grasp an object similarly to the two parts of a robotic gripper. The SaeboMAS is a commercially available mobile arm support to neutralize gravity effects on the paretic arm specifically designed to facilitate and challenge the weakened shoulder muscles during functional tasks. The proposed system has been designed to be used during the rehabilitation phase when the arm is potentially able to recover its functionality, but the hand is still not able to perform a grasp due to the lack of an efficient thumb opposition. The overall system also act as a motivation tool for the patients to perform task-oriented rehabilitation activities.#R##N##R##N#With the aid of proposed system, the patient can closely simulate the desired motion with the non-functional arm for rehabilitation purposes, while performing a grasp with the help of the Soft-SixthFinger. As a pilot study we tested the proposed system with a chronic stroke patient to evaluate how the mobile arm support in conjunction with a robotic supernumerary finger can help in performing the tasks requiring the manipulation of grasped object through the paretic arm. In particular, we performed the Frenchay Arm Test (FAT) and Box and Block Test (BBT). The proposed system successfully enabled the patient to complete tasks which were previously impossible to perform.","['Irfan Hussain', 'Gionata Salvietti', 'Giovanni Spagnoletti', 'Monica Malvezzi', 'David Cioncoloni', 'Simone Rossi', 'Domenico Prattichizzo']",a8ef9451-883e-4629-9b7d-ff031838ecdc,0,"['06776c48-1591-4788-b588-356e5e75cf63', '0724d238-30ad-4db6-8f91-31ae96d26c01', '082f8cbf-e738-41ce-80dd-15672bf29a4f', '3a37006e-71d9-42b5-9110-106fdce52c7f', '5d952923-34dc-41eb-9a3c-32fee7498e6e', '7e73752f-0aac-47a0-b6be-9eb34b6f29fa', 'c244f6f0-d636-401c-abe0-75f7ce790a23', 'de17405e-bcc4-4294-b0f1-f7ca553f502b', 'e635786c-9c5d-437c-be70-5f4a7ad2521f', 'f7dab72d-894e-45fb-bdf4-8d76da061d24']",A soft supernumerary robotic finger and mobile arm support for grasping compensation and hemiparetic upper limb rehabilitation,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2017

242,"In this study, we propose two analysis dictionary learning algorithms for sparse representation with analysis model. The problem is formulated with the 1-norm regularizer and with two penalty terms on the analysis dictionary: the term of logdet(T) and the coherence penalty term. As the processing scheme, we employ a block coordinate descent framework, so that the overall problem is transformed into a set of minimizations of univariate subproblems with respect to a single-vector variable. Each subproblem is still nonsmooth, but it can be solved by a proximal operator and then the closed-form solutions can be obtained directly and explicitly. In particular, the coherence penalty, excluding excessively similar or repeated dictionary atoms, is solved at the same time as the dictionary update, thereby reducing the complexity. Furthermore, a scheme with a group of atoms is introduced in one proposed algorithm, which has a lower complexity. According to our analysis and simulation study, the main advantages of the proposed algorithms are their greater dictionary recovery ratios especially in the low-cosparsity case, and their faster running time of reaching the stable values of the dictionary recovery ratios and the recovery cosparsity compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, one proposed algorithm performs well in image denoising and in noise cancellation.","['Zhenni Li', 'Shuxue Ding', 'Takafumi Hayashi', 'Yujie Li']",c6f4343b-80f4-467c-9f68-d47e0f763d4c,0,"['0e5b2303-0a93-46e0-96fd-069916e37b21', '109367fa-db04-4db0-8777-d6ca7e9e78fd', '11dfdff9-7680-489f-a30f-96198eccff31', '1544035e-053d-497d-8c81-09a368317de9', '158057ab-ca1d-4109-b909-a890e5618eb9', '18d5c966-e1bd-403c-9003-c44b33397049', '19a84626-b0ef-4d3c-a9a0-28957ff3d93a', '3bad1f87-46e6-4ed3-8f4c-93a46b1fb86b', '3ee6e7a5-5d3d-4181-b3c9-aa48820d2abb', '423615d7-7afc-4306-a4ab-5aba3fffaa4c', '49105700-f12b-4f44-915d-60b45a2733f0', '519e8020-0c21-4e88-b21a-027beb3283d8', '56fefaac-acc7-4a9e-8cbd-7175ba1463bd', '5a3be001-62cb-4bec-a1d7-87eaec957244', '5cf97da9-9327-42ff-9fa2-8df41d0cec68', '66ecab89-6324-4c01-8162-480f74f66f6f', '67441059-620e-4932-90dd-25d324e1f44f', '7583896d-d639-4f5d-8b42-2f0374d38b8e', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '83db5701-5d71-4d4d-affd-f0c3b9a5457c', '9e9b7df7-45fe-4486-9c58-b0638e457222', 'a0ac1a8d-5e1a-44e9-b494-b9c6953af98b', 'a263a176-2078-4310-9afd-0eac8fbd45ef', 'a866200f-b4ed-4f38-86d5-bd55ba2d0591', 'ab67bd90-bb62-401e-b5a6-488d085f9d60', 'b580f34f-d7ce-4ee6-b771-63e8f744d299', 'b8a19d2c-f597-4693-82f0-611b33701a5a', 'bcd44ddf-6b5a-4572-89ca-e8fbaecd3150', 'c1ceaf9b-605d-46a7-a9a0-2135cb856f3f', 'c8324da9-9c01-4384-aeb1-230c173192b8', 'c974b624-3d45-427b-8628-a58f70268e50', 'd868e809-1ed0-467f-b909-6a7131d79ca9', 'dc00db94-f638-4ba6-9a32-7cce7d8f1856', 'f571a0f0-69fb-485d-bb51-1735a5e86a50', 'fbad2c67-f526-45ac-8abc-45b14e93bd74', 'fdbc47a8-b923-4c07-88f3-d251a18396d0']",Analysis dictionary learning using block coordinate descent framework with proximal operators,Neurocomputing,2017
243,"The multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method is known to be asymptotically efficient, yet with a small number of snapshots its performance degrades due to bias in MUSIC localization function. In this communication, starting from G-MUSIC which improves over MUSIC in low sample support, a high signal to noise ratio approximation of the G-MUSIC localization function is derived. This approximation results in closed-form expressions of the weights applied to each eigenvector of the sample covariance matrix. A new method which consists in minimizing this simplified G-MUSIC localization function is thus introduced, and referred to as sG-MUSIC. Interestingly enough, this sG-MUSIC criterion can be interpreted as a bias correction of the conventional MUSIC localization function. Numerical simulations indicate that sG-MUSIC incur only a marginal loss in terms of mean square error of the direction of arrival estimates, as compared to G-MUSIC, and performs better than MUSIC.","['François Vincent', 'Frédéric Pascal 0001', 'Olivier Besson']",ab7247de-bf43-4e62-b817-a2cb3a7a9f97,0,"['457e9d1a-6e1e-4ec4-a927-1818e88a3384', '48dd5180-86fe-46eb-9866-b0e8ff777f87', '7527841c-4912-4d63-b7db-fd6cbef7be2b', '86a32c0e-6d71-4871-8175-fd54a986f4f1', '9361866d-c47f-49fe-bbbe-4abb62217511', '94c60e45-8f92-49f0-866f-2a15902114a3', 'b153c819-1a6a-4d1d-a54b-df1a410a3ac4', 'b4c5f87e-6678-4e20-9894-f6e4d840092a', 'f0683ee1-1a7a-4c29-8a96-b0b3446f61e3']",A bias-compensated MUSIC for small number of samples,Signal Processing,2017

The quantGenius workflow interactively guides the user through data import, quality control (QC) and calculation steps. The input is machine- and chemistry–independent. Quantification is performed using the standard curve approach, with normalization to one or several reference genes. The special feature of the application is the implementation of user-guided QC-based decision support system, based on qPCR standards, that takes into account pipetting errors, assay amplification efficiencies, limits of detection and quantification of the assays as well as the control of PCR inhibition in individual samples. The intermediate calculations and final results are exportable in a data matrix suitable for further statistical analysis or visualization. We additionally compare the most important features of quantGenius with similar advanced software tools and illustrate the importance of proper QC system in the analysis of qPCR data in two use cases.

By m(n,F)m(n,F) we denote the smallest number mm such that there are graphs G1G1 and G2G2 both of order nn with |E(G1)|+|E(G2)|=m|E(G1)|+|E(G2)|=m which do not have a FF-near-packing. It is well known that m(n,E0)=m(n,D0)=m(n,K1)=3(n−1)2+1 because a E0E0, D0D0 or K1K1-near-packing is just a packing. In this paper we prove that m(n,E1)=m(n,D1)=2n−1m(n,E1)=m(n,D1)=2n−1 and, for sufficiently large nn, m(n,D2)=5(n−1)2+1. We also obtain distinct bounds on m(n,Ek)m(n,Ek) for k≥2k≥2, m(n,D3)m(n,D3), and m(n,Kk)m(n,Kk) for k≥2k≥2, under conditions imposed on nn and kk.","['Jerzy Konarski', 'Andrzej Żak']",81ccd2ef-8ef6-454b-8272-2f185df7ac10,0,"['656f89ad-de36-4b47-9ad0-aacb5dc54b9b', 'b016227e-de7b-4b07-b499-9cc2c25fe01c', 'e6a0fd4f-f949-4af8-a097-991dbf520bd2', 'e8828036-8670-4674-afe1-1fcf7d12d495', 'f83c16ef-6d25-4b98-87d9-0aa2dfd09aae']",Near packings of two graphs,Discrete Mathematics,2017
249,"The spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the third generation of artificial neural networks, which have made great achievements in the field of pattern recognition. However, the existing supervised training methods of SNNs are not efficient enough to meet the real-time requirement in most cases. To address this issue, the normalized perceptron based learning rule (NPBLR) is proposed in this paper for the supervised training of the multi-layer SNNs. Different from traditional methods, our algorithm only trains the selected misclassified time points and the target ones, employing the perceptron based neuron. Furthermore, the weight modification in our algorithm is normalized by a voltage based function, which is more efficient than the traditional time based method because the firing time is calculated by the voltage value. Superior to the traditional multi-layer algorithm ignoring the time accumulation of spikes, our algorithm defines the spiking activity of the postsynaptic neuron as the rate accumulation function of all presynaptic neurons in a specific time-frame. By these strategies, our algorithm overcomes some difficulties in the training of SNNs, e.g., the inefficient and no-fire problems. Comprehensive simulations are conducted both in single and multi-layer networks to investigate the learning performance of our algorithm, whose results demonstrate that our algorithm possesses higher learning efficiency and stronger parameter robustness than traditional algorithms.","['Xiurui Xie', 'Hong Qu', 'Guisong Liu', 'Malu Zhang']",c88627cd-40c5-452e-a0c6-101bdb037412,0,"['0443c2d6-89d0-467d-85bc-675a0295c88c', '0f549041-8707-4bad-befc-8e735e8aa1e0', '164c05e8-16c3-42c6-b06b-1255b00f06e0', '2c3a5bee-a7c2-4912-9749-d0ea1ff46714', '314be1e1-307a-45c3-a414-730835d6850f', '33d1ec49-24bf-478d-8090-e7357eb4b73f', '354ea407-3aa6-4c20-a4e7-6446401a53dd', '391fbc19-7bf6-4058-86cf-0a0b6e5389d3', '3b80f28d-06b0-4162-9185-b2d310bc4ecd', '3c2168c6-3ce3-41f3-941e-8ae775b65a8b', '3d0a0764-22ef-4024-b0c4-efcaf2ffca92', '49982f30-987e-4f1c-8693-599c65d392a9', '4df4fbee-6ab8-43c1-bf78-b37b4dc292c8', '4ed5a12b-0c11-4ecb-96e5-c39b647a0240', '508fe6bc-af05-422e-8995-471185aa28f7', '74ceacb1-b8b7-4ccc-ae47-dd47a6f5009f', '787932a8-8916-4ed6-a4d3-b7c3d550fb98', '982d63bf-b08c-45d4-a701-f43cc4cb9d7f', '9d75a725-682f-440c-84bd-110940aa75ba', 'afa0a2c6-7b91-49a8-ac93-89ae87c4f7ce', 'b9b68d32-7a9b-4934-b763-4eaafa3fa52a', 'bd314636-5ff9-4110-b2b2-d9a9355554f1', 'c1ad2446-66ef-425f-b97d-1f5db2d60c94', 'c4fcb885-ee80-405f-af3d-4059adbd487a', 'c86aaa25-cf0e-4651-a0dd-a5464210084e', 'd47a293c-c13a-49c9-95ca-2726f98ab30f', 'e8f33213-c0c6-4fd9-a6a0-2709dc805137', 'e9c3d8f8-0d6d-495f-9970-cfa07f4181ba', 'efc3e554-4525-4bd0-955a-1cd04f446077', 'fac1694e-3eb3-4021-8b3f-c1883063e5dc', 'fb8ee62d-f69b-42a0-abc9-ab9e97f61782']",Efficient training of supervised spiking neural networks via the normalized perceptron based learning rule,Neurocomputing,2017
250,"Most computer codes in Radar Cross Section (RCS) prediction use Physical Optics (PO) and Physical theory of Diffraction (PTD) combined with Geometrical Optics (GO) and Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD). The latter approaches are computationally cheaper and much more accurate for curved surfaces, but not applicable for the computation of the RCS of all surfaces of a complex object due to the presence of caustic problems in the analysis of concave surfaces or flat surfaces in the far field. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a hybrid method based on a new combination of two asymptotic techniques: GTD and PO, considering the advantages and avoiding the disadvantages of each of them. A very efficient and accurate method to analyze the RCS of complex structures at high frequencies is obtained with the new combination. The proposed new method has been validated comparing RCS results obtained for some simple cases using the proposed approach and RCS using the rigorous technique of Method of Moments (MoM). Some complex cases have been examined at high frequencies contrasting the results with PO. This study shows the accuracy and the efficiency of the hybrid method and its suitability for the computation of the RCS at really large and complex targets at high frequencies.","['María-Jesús Algar', 'Lorena Lozano', 'Javier Morneo', 'Ivan Gonzalez', 'Felipe Catedra']",bb5d6887-5ad0-4b25-8c31-6e7390e88ff5,0,[],An efficient hybrid technique in RCS predictions of complex targets at high frequencies,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
251,"Clustering is an important unsupervised learning approach with wide application in data mining, pattern recognition and intelligent information processing. However, existing clustering algorithms usually involve one or more user-specified parameters as input and their clustering results depend heavily on these parameters. In order to solve this problem, we present a parameter independent clustering algorithm based on the dominant sets algorithm and cluster merging. In the first step histogram equalization transformation is applied to solve the parameter dependence problem of the dominant sets algorithm. We provide the theoretic foundation of this method and discuss the implementation details. The clustering result is then refined with a cluster merging method, which is based on a new clustering quality evaluation criterion. We use extensive experiments on several datasets to validate each step and the whole procedures of our algorithm. It is shown that our parameter independent algorithm performs comparably to some existing clustering algorithms which benefit from user-specified parameters.","['Jian Hou', 'Weixue Liu']",b9bb59e5-08cd-4dff-9dba-81df786a73c9,0,"['069957e3-91c3-472c-9f35-d3100add6134', '126446a1-730e-44dc-858b-e5c768bd81ac', '1a8957ce-3eb4-44cc-b6bd-20cb232b613b', '33716924-a3c8-407b-8448-0398eaf90bc1', '344d9ec4-1c17-4ba1-82e9-ff86a6d6a8df', '3eeeae9b-8b97-4bb9-a313-1491e40d01ed', '50be2a60-27f8-4673-bebb-cc80aeb0b27b', '63b2fdf6-af2f-4f99-b027-d058e8e7dffe', '6b5ec0c3-7c1c-4870-bc11-8f3a2b653edd', '7a89da64-90f5-4ecd-a878-37d08bcfd177', '7c90045b-63b9-4f29-82a0-bf7c914a6ef6', '8031b6dc-e4bd-4bde-9293-87a7aad7d833', '881f0085-b708-4f92-8c49-3c7c51f1980c', '9762f61c-7bbe-4f65-be64-bb0135dc6cb7', '9b7add4e-495b-428f-bda4-f5d76de3ba99', 'a386b82a-ea05-4f43-a860-092abc30e954', 'ad23cd06-a871-4b37-ad31-eafaf2595a4a', 'b78808c9-8e90-474d-a4f3-76defbe9baae', 'df309cdf-7e03-403b-a868-c81bc6a19aa7', 'e3a40536-5580-4c24-b273-4fa4dab2579e', 'e554e1c8-7b1b-4c52-b9c3-70b037586f48', 'ea8cd3d8-17ae-4a1e-8f83-1609469087af', 'ec0c146d-ff15-4f73-8ea1-55268340ab42', 'f505afb8-a7c5-408f-a1bd-1c8c3ac332d1', 'f69e1dd9-06eb-4bee-8935-46c7bc19a2b3', 'f9c421f8-6e2f-463e-97a3-0682abe8df23']",Parameter independent clustering based on dominant sets and cluster merging,Information Sciences,2017

Moreover, we present a special discretisation scheme to account for possible discontinuities in the electrical conductivity.

254,"The current gold standard in dimension reduction methods for high-throughput genotype data is the Principle Component Analysis (PCA). The presence of PCA is so dominant, that other methods usually cannot be found in the analyst’s toolbox and hence are only rarely applied. We present a modern dimension reduction method called ’Invariant Coordinate Selection’ (ICS) and its application to high-throughput genotype data. The more commonly known Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is in this framework just a special case of ICS. We use ICS on both, a simulated and a real dataset to demonstrate first some deficiencies of PCA and how ICS is capable to recover the correct subgroups within the simulated data. Second, we apply the ICS method on a chicken dataset and also detect there two subgroups. These subgroups are then further investigated with respect to their genotype to provide further evidence of the biological relevance of the detected subgroup division. Further, we compare the performance of ICS also to five other popular dimension reduction methods. The ICS method was able to detect subgroups in data where the PCA fails to detect anything. Hence, we promote the application of ICS to high-throughput genotype data in addition to the established PCA. Especially in statistical programming environments like e.g. R, its application does not add any computational burden to the analysis pipeline.","['Daniel Fischer', 'Mervi Honkatukia', 'Maria Tuiskula-Haavisto', 'Klaus Nordhausen', 'D.

260,"Social network services (SNSs) enable users to conveniently share personal information. Often, the information shared concerns other people, especially other members of the SNS. In such situations, two or more people can have conflicting privacy preferences; thus, an appropriate sharing policy may not be apparent. We identify such situations as  multiuser privacy scenarios . Current approaches propose finding a sharing policy through preference aggregation. However, studies suggest that users feel more confident in their decisions regarding sharing when they know the reasons behind each other’s preferences. The goals of this paper are (1) understanding how people decide the appropriate sharing policy in multiuser scenarios where arguments are employed, and (2) developing a computational model to predict an appropriate sharing policy for a given scenario. We report on a study that involved a survey of 988 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users about a variety of multiuser scenarios and the optimal sharing policy for each scenario. Our evaluation of the participants’ responses reveals that contextual factors, user preferences, and arguments influence the optimal sharing policy in a multiuser scenario. We develop and evaluate an inference model that predicts the optimal sharing policy given the three types of features. We analyze the predictions of our inference model to uncover potential scenario types that lead to incorrect predictions, and to enhance our understanding of when multiuser scenarios are more or less prone to dispute.","['Ricard L.

261,"We propose an adaptive multistage classification scheme, based on the principle of multiresolution, using a naturally hierarchical wavelet representation of signals. The use of this principle in the context of a multi-class recognition task leads to the multistage binary classification tree, where recognition at different stages is performed with varying degrees of precision. In the paper, multistage minimum-distance NM-type binary classifier with reject option is introduced and examined. We analyze the upper bound of risk of the developed multistage classifier, especially paying attention to the impact of free (design) parameters on the efficiency of the classifier. The theoretical considerations are illustrated by simulation experiment and practical examples based on some benchmarks.","['Urszula Libal', 'Zygmunt Hasiewicz']",a27f1ad6-3f68-482c-ab12-acd6c83d1fec,0,"['031045d8-ea8c-4b8c-9a01-2a44f962e0a8', '0f115eea-2272-431f-9f21-6d6789b2bbc9', '0fd30dd9-5af9-47c0-93fd-65be96a6beb2', '1017d9d4-9a4c-423d-ad40-6d9bebbd6b31', '1108eae7-32b4-42c9-9433-afdd86acf956', '122a495d-3965-461a-a50c-7f602a79d8fe', '1e007e8c-2cf4-409e-af0a-3b9cff4cb39c', '1fc30952-ba10-4009-890a-288d28118460', '209af518-58ef-452f-8c67-45a1ae87e2f8', '25566ada-24be-40cc-819a-a72fdb0aad4b', '3992ce65-f753-4c3c-a6bb-e7d48c135acf', '426ee5de-476c-45c1-b801-712b8339c489', '485598b2-ed73-4670-a44d-b0844f923fa4', '51c87f93-9e1a-41c4-a151-b60b1f356ff1', '5880d47f-8b99-416d-a743-28d6b49f7ba9', '6ad0712c-207e-4c14-b9ad-8ef77b5ffe47', '6d903194-6be4-4780-9ccf-d60916e00770', '70a1bccb-83c6-4a97-aad8-51d4112daec5', '7ccbdf09-a84e-4ad2-ab20-cb28b6c41155', '8d65f470-f754-4a34-b843-1cd268f62143', '8e95a531-66f0-4c55-bef6-1b28cc8bb16a', '90a7d3c3-d4d5-4a03-8b18-0c3357d45f93', '9140eb7b-aac2-49b6-bfc1-7ed1ae65a624', '9836613c-d506-47ca-be5c-9b126f250ddc', 'b75a0f51-6023-4593-b18a-c5ba92079433', 'c169dc7a-afa1-49e7-9127-e7fe2c8bc015', 'c5841a09-605d-4444-927b-bd1aac6da62e', 'e460a9e6-8177-4cc5-91c1-2f6ea10d7698', 'fa3f0fb3-1c62-4f9c-b025-389ee9d893b7', 'fa417d5b-43da-4088-88e3-2c8fb61d83c6']",Risk upper bound for a NM-type multiresolution classification scheme of random signals by Daubechies wavelets,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2017
262,"This paper deals with preconditioners for solving linear systems arising from interior point methods, using iterative methods. The main focus is the development of a set of results that allows a more efficient computation of the splitting preconditioner. During the interior point methods iterations, the linear system matrix becomes ill conditioned, leading to numerical difficulties to find a solution, even with iterative methods. Therefore, the choice of an effective preconditioner is essential for the success of the approach. The paper proposes a new ordering for a splitting preconditioner, taking advantage of the sparse structure of the original matrix. A formal demonstration shows that performing this new ordering the preconditioned matrix condition number is limited; numerical experiments reinforce the theoretical results. Case studies show that the proposed idea has better sparsity features than the original version of the splitting preconditioner and that it is competitive regarding the computational time.","['Luciana Casacio', 'Christiano Lyra', 'Aurelio Ribeiro Leite de Oliveira', 'Cecilia Orellana Castro']",ad90c5ba-0146-4cab-9f99-b4b5bff7de48,0,"['0371cdb3-271f-4927-b34e-39fddb22f1e4', '0d2772d9-8e7a-40a9-82ee-8506f7d18526', '12dab383-4fd4-40f4-b057-3df739fe6c3c', '1510ffaf-e709-4e54-a90c-c8e923ac4a3e', '40e903b3-9f18-47e1-a04e-d61e064098c4', '4c397e62-f86c-416a-a84a-57db3b0b6308', '6edef3d5-ce9d-43f4-abbf-7e0abbbd50bb', '842bdc52-c78f-4657-84b5-9394cf1bfc48', 'a939e19f-e2ad-4419-904b-d238624b9885', 'cf3ad55b-9b06-4b58-a9a5-3432674bb595', 'dfe3d243-612a-4e96-ab8a-7161a221b01f', 'e7a16109-7235-4970-b0c9-c1e02e9088f3']",Improving the preconditioning of linear systems from interior point methods,Computers & Operations Research,2017

264,"Background and Objectives#R##N#Automatic delineation of the myocardium in echocardiography can assist radiologists to diagnosis heart problems. However, it is still challenging to distinguish myocardium from other tissue due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, low contrast, vague boundary, and speckle noise. The purpose of this study is to automatically detect myocardium region in left ventricle myocardial contrast echocardiography (LVMCE) images to help radiologists’ diagnosis and further measurement on infarction size.#R##N#Methods#R##N#The LVMCE image is firstly mapped into neutrosophic similarity (NS) domain using the intensity and homogeneity features. Then, a neutrosophic active contour model (NACM) is proposed and the energy function is defined by the NS values. Finally, the ventricle is detected using the curve evolving results. The ventricle's boundary is identified as the endocardium. To speed up the evolution procedure and increase the detection accuracy, a clustering algorithm is employed to obtain the initial ventricle region. The curve evolution procedure in NACM is utilized again to obtain the epicardium, where the initial contour uses the detected endocardium and the anatomy knowledge on the thickness of the myocardium.#R##N#Results#R##N#Echocardiographic studies are performed on 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats using a Vivid 7 system including 5 normal cases and 5 rats with myocardial infarction. The myocardium boundaries manually outlined by an experienced radiologist are used as the reference standard for the performance evaluation. Two metrics, Hdist and AvgDist, are employed to evaluate the detection results. The NACM method was compared with those from the eliminated particle swarm optimization (EPSO) and active contour model without edges (ACMWE) methods. The mean and standard deviation of the Hdist and AvgDist on endocardium are 6.83±1.12 mm and 0.79±0.28 mm using EPSO method, 7.12±0.98 mm and 0.82±0.32 mm using ACMWE method, and 4.55±0.9 mm and 0.58±0.18 mm using NACM method, respectively. The improvement on epicardium is much more significant, and two metrics are decreased from 7.45±1.24 mm, and 1.47±0.34 mm using EPSO method, and 8.21±0.43 mm, and 1.73±0.47 mm using ACMWE method, to 4.94±0.82 mm, and 0.84±0.22 mm using NACM method, respectively.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#The proposed method can automatically detect myocardium accurately, and is helpful for clinical therapeutics to measure myocardial perfusion and infarct size.","['Yanhui Guo', 'Guo-Qing Du', 'Jingyi Xue', 'Rong Xia', 'Yu-hang Wang']",54ba0a3e-d31d-4e41-8783-a40574d31a1f,0,"['1a67aef4-ca92-40c7-8d41-45b8ea6b96d6', '1bb29869-e587-44af-ad8c-c4dafd29abce', '1c63e1d5-b963-455b-829d-e4f3eb63a36a', '219d1eca-ec49-4533-a19d-144aa323461f', '2463cf1f-fe43-4090-9245-df2e7a97fb96', '4c3617a2-1c29-4098-b748-f639e9c451a9', '5ba108a3-4548-47fc-8007-ed2045fb5c1a', '61a8ed42-d662-479f-91ba-54013d4a9c7d', '63162767-eea8-44c3-b9b8-e80aba624de2', '8558a0bb-84aa-40c8-991d-fcb4c0d630f8', '8595ca34-4a51-43d3-8e88-9b0f64e0a520', '9f28e3cf-4992-4785-b823-191429377e8f', 'b5a9a27b-3f51-4ed8-89cd-d5c36ec7b70d', 'c56363ae-c277-4b33-81c4-5b8dc41d12b0', 'ca2aa940-6f70-4124-87c2-7cf2ee57017f', 'dc436c13-fbf9-4117-bcf9-cf4faea0f39f', 'df7b1dd3-ffc5-490a-89cf-2c0de9149037', 'f70d5569-fbb4-4fb7-85f6-276dd196d7e9', 'fae70feb-ec53-4584-a156-b3da7d3709c3']",A Novel Myocardium Segmentation Approach Based on Neutrosophic Active Contour Model,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,2017

269,"Remote sensing of top-of-canopy (TOC) long-term sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is necessary to better understand the SIF-photosynthesis relationship. Statistical methods provide an alternative to TOC SIF retrieval, as they are independent of synchronous irradiance measurements and may better describe actual irradiance. This letter aims to evaluate the feasibility of using statistical methods for time series TOC SIF retrieval in the absence of synchronous irradiance measurements. Results show that the training set should include nonfluorescent radiance spectra under a variety of solar zenith angles, and that water vapor is an important contributor of spectral variation within 717–745 nm. On the diurnal scale, atmospheric features trained from irradiance spectra can be used to retrieve SIF values from high-frequency upwelling radiance spectra. Features independently trained from nonfluorescent radiance spectra measured on one day can be used for SIF retrieval on a different day within a relatively short period. Our results show that statistical methods have the potential to simplify ground-based SIF measurements and data processing.","['Lifu Zhang', 'Siheng Wang', 'Changping Huang', 'Yi Cen', 'Yongguang Zhai', 'Qingxi Tong']",6659fb08-7eb3-470c-b6d7-5dfbb3792456,0,"['589d765d-6cc6-4569-9bf8-2cb76ef82fff', 'afe96749-1b93-415e-ae2a-262df930f4ea', 'f43dbc7b-018d-49b1-8eda-dd520b80aa81']",Retrieval of Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Using Statistical Method Without Synchronous Irradiance Data,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
270,"Complex activity recognition is challenging since a complex activity can be performed in different ways, with each having its own configuration of primitive events and their temporal dependencies. To address such temporal relational variabilities in complex activity recognition, we propose a Bayesian network-based probabilistic generative framework that employs Allen’s interval relation network to represent local temporal dependencies in a generative way. By employing the Chinese restaurant process and introducing relation generation constraints, our framework can characterize these unique internal configurations of a particular complex activity as a joint distribution. Three concrete models are implemented based on our framework. Specifically, in this paper we improve two of our previous models and provide an enhanced model to handle temporal relational variabilities in complex activities more efficiently. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our framework. In particular, it is shown that our models are rather robust against errors caused by the low-level predictions from raw signals.","['Li Liu', 'Shu Wang', 'Guoxin Su', 'Zi-Gang Huang', 'Ming Liu']",232883e5-68cc-424a-b971-edd404f6a216,50,"['0865e5a6-85c6-4a55-8a7e-56cdfbb8bbfd', '0880fa4a-9d45-4040-8d94-9233902fcd34', '0c57c043-2771-498a-8afc-6a17d7d50165', '13f342a4-7a6c-4f9e-834f-465beb977b6b', '1a075ce7-3d3c-4306-9445-6f4ccacf76ff', '41e4fd01-bf3c-40e6-8e1b-b8eca5f67097', '55ef7651-9bb4-4edc-9600-84aef871f348', '5648503f-fc33-4cf7-958c-e8b179303955', '63b11aa1-81ed-44f8-9fff-cbee1a8ca59e', '64636f5c-00d5-4dd6-ae94-9d5899a32d2c', '64b02d8b-180a-4d51-9442-2b6face6d353', '67308319-7e96-48b4-902d-fa9126c84c24', '6c85573a-3134-457f-809e-5aa4f373859f', '73e94939-2299-4a10-ba74-707060261059', '765a7ed1-697e-474c-ba9b-4c69f9667074', '7bef9e77-df3a-4e89-b078-5ab39b9c7e9c', '8544864d-16ac-40e0-9c89-4ea9a13ef798', '8bae8dd9-8fd5-4f2a-ae95-5406a5a7a863', '99c05072-0284-42a2-a3ca-9d99672ae679', 'a500ee15-610e-4f96-973d-68c522fceb17', 'addec62c-be83-42eb-ab60-00a2a4903158', 'b0ebe10d-2d80-49ce-b6a8-5a7501ea78bb', 'b793330a-8224-439e-b35e-8a234f2e7e5a', 'b99d0d6f-1dd2-474e-9172-4567b5dadb40', 'bab52f03-262c-485e-9ee9-c0b05cdff846', 'bb14a8fd-10dc-43f5-94f0-a27f7d41bdeb', 'bb948ac3-8ffc-492f-b738-46ebe8c8093b', 'cad269ad-6ae9-485e-9e14-fc2e589c74a1', 'd8ab30e5-8375-440a-a44a-86f942d39a99', 'dbe5ae2e-bbc0-4508-8df5-3ec95c784fa8', 'e5a301fb-eb3c-473a-8851-0bd3f3217dde', 'ed6bd4ab-b28a-4994-bcf2-784d68fd2771', 'efb099a0-6344-4d10-87cd-bdc6e7a518d2', 'f0c45b6b-0dc3-40a7-ad18-1d3c8e673d53', 'f5d57bc8-5026-4eaa-affe-3dfb77ab4bbf', 'fb4dff50-380b-4f6c-a596-8a4a5d510081']",Towards complex activity recognition using a Bayesian network-based probabilistic generative framework,Pattern Recognition,2017
271,"Abstract  Background  Internet access and usage has changed how people seek and report health information. Meanwhile,infectious diseases continue to threaten humanity. The analysis of Big Data, or vast digital data, presents an opportunity to improve disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Epidemic intelligence contains two components: indicator based and event-based. A relatively new surveillance type has emerged called event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. These systems use information on events impacting health from Internet sources, such as social media or news aggregates. These systems circumvent the limitations of traditional reporting systems by being inexpensive, transparent, and flexible. Yet, innovations and the functionality of these systems can change rapidly.  Aim  To update the current state of knowledge on event-based Internet biosurveillance systems by identifying all systems, including current functionality, with hopes to aid decision makers with whether to incorporate new methods into comprehensive programmes of surveillance.  Methods  A systematic review was performed through PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, while also including grey literature and other publication types.  Results  50 event-based Internet systems were identified, including an extraction of 15 attributes for each system, described in 99 articles. Each system uses different innovative technology and data sources to gather data, process, and disseminate data to detect infectious disease outbreaks.  Conclusions  The review emphasises the importance of using both formal and informal sources for timely and accurate infectious disease outbreak surveillance, cataloguing all event-based Internet biosurveillance systems. By doing so, future researchers will be able to use this review as a library for referencing systems, with hopes of learning, building, and expanding Internet-based surveillance systems. Event-based Internet biosurveillance should act as an extension of traditional systems, to be utilised as an additional, supplemental data source to have a more comprehensive estimate of disease burden.","[""Jesse O'Shea""]",7614778c-7451-41ac-8007-6a9d52749012,0,"['1e00bbd7-ab4c-4cba-8c1a-b30c1bd130c0', '200acb90-ce1f-450d-8789-ab869d62e4d0']",Digital disease detection: A systematic review of event-based internet biosurveillance systems,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2017
272,"High voltage circuit breakers (HVCBs) are among most important pieces of equipment in the power system, and thus its fault diagnosis is quite essential for efficient operation. Most related research can only diagnose the known fault. However, the diagnosis may fail to work when an unknown fault occurs. Aimed to address the lack of new knowledge acquisition and real-time model classification updating, a novel method based on particle swarm optimization-support vector domain description (P-SVDD) and particle swarm optimization-kernel-based fuzzy c-means (P-KFCM) is proposed for adaptive fault diagnosis of HVCBs in this paper. In the proposed method, P-SVDD can detect the unknown fault sample by particle swarm optimization (PSO) parameter optimization while P-KFCM is used in known sample category recognition and its modified partition coefficient (MPC) cluster validity is used in unknown fault category search. The proposed method's operation process is introduced in detail, and the principles underlying the adaptive fault diagnosis model are discussed as well. In engineering application of an online monitoring system with fault diagnosis, the simulation results based on the measured HVCB closing coil current show that the proposed adaptive model can acquire new knowledge and update model classification in real-time with a higher diagnostic accuracy, compared with the existing algorithms.","['Kedong Zhu', 'Fei Mei', 'Jianyong Zheng']",025eadd3-35ab-4d28-9c9e-682ba7133d7f,0,"['0fb3947f-f8cf-45d5-8781-9a3e2125a0d1', '1c6fd3df-7e0e-4f63-af60-d0f2f4337f2b', '426f6351-0e56-4c21-af46-c88801703104', '49b45fc9-0faf-4f01-a165-8ea42b217fb0', '769e87a7-76ce-4c7f-8d7a-b470681e39e7', '78b0577c-2037-43dc-89d5-1fe00f8b3ac5', '791391f4-f7e2-4982-971f-69f7415d2916', '944bbfe7-cdf4-4a9b-8411-953c5bc7e4a8', 'a4f24a2e-20d7-4989-ab73-9c9158d9c0dc', 'b8f031ee-d823-4f80-ac3c-38b521b9aa90', 'ca164e4f-2f48-4bf8-a411-2221c8d2211b', 'e72b68c5-3a1e-4f7e-af88-165b3a9af5f8']",Adaptive fault diagnosis of HVCBs based on P-SVDD and P-KFCM,Neurocomputing,2017

274,"Subspace designs are a (large) collection of high-dimensional subspaces $\{H_i\},$ of $\F_q^m$ such that for any low-dimensional subspace $W$, only a small number of subspaces from the collection have non-trivial intersection with $W$; more precisely, the sum of dimensions of $W \cap H_i$ is at most some parameter $L$. The notion was put forth by Guruswami and Xing (STOC'13) with applications to list decoding variants of Reed-Solomon and algebraic-geometric codes, and later also used for explicit rank-metric codes with optimal list decoding radius. #R##N#Guruswami and Kopparty (FOCS'13, Combinatorica'16) gave an explicit construction of subspace designs with near-optimal parameters. This construction was based on polynomials and has close connections to folded Reed-Solomon codes, and required large field size (specifically $q \ge m$). Forbes and Guruswami (RANDOM'15) used this construction to give explicit constant degree ""dimension expanders"" over large fields, and noted that subspace designs are a powerful tool in linear-algebraic pseudorandomness. #R##N#Here, we construct subspace designs over any field, at the expense of a modest worsening of the bound $L$ on total intersection dimension. Our approach is based on a (non-trivial) extension of the polynomial-based construction to algebraic function fields, and instantiating the approach with cyclotomic function fields.

275,"This paper studies the robust convergence properties of iterative learning control (ILC) for single-input, single-output (SISO), nonrepetitive systems subject to iteration-dependent uncertainties that arise in not only initial states and external disturbances but also plant models. Given an extended relative degree condition, it is possible to propose necessary and sufficient (NAS) conditions for robust ILC convergence. The tracking error bound is shown to depend continuously on the bounds of the iteration-dependent uncertainties. When the iteration-dependent uncertainties are bounded, NAS conditions exist to guarantee bounded system trajectories and output tracking error. If the iteration-dependent uncertainties converge, then NAS conditions ensure bounded system trajectories and zero output tracking error. The results are also extended to a class of affine nonlinear systems satisfying a Lipschitz condition. Simulation tests on a representative batch process demonstrate the validity of the obtained robust ILC convergence results.","['Deyuan Meng', 'Kevin L.

276,"The power of particle filters in tracking the state of nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems stems not only from their simple numerical implementation but also from their optimality and convergence properties. In particle filtering, the posterior distribution of the state is approximated by a discrete mass of samples, called particles, that stochastically evolve in time according to the dynamics of the model and the observations. Particle filters have been shown to converge almost surely toward the optimal filter as the number of particles increases. However, when additional constraints are imposed, such that every particle must satisfy these constraints, the optimality properties and error bounds of the constrained particle filter remain unexplored. This letter derives performance limits and error bounds of the constrained particle filter. We show that the estimation error is bounded by the area of the state posterior density that does not include the constraining interval. In particular, the error is small if the target density is “well localized” in the constraining interval.","['Nesrine Amor', 'Nidhal Bouaynaya', 'Roman Shterenberg', 'Souad Chebbi']",9a994e92-6bef-4e83-b8f6-7454bcf8a320,0,"['1138f15e-0380-4051-bf38-4dd87cd7b7e2', '1bd9cb06-0a3a-42bd-b550-69a8cb8ad251', '1bf6c069-5c21-43df-9db5-3eff0a8888f4', '6a329160-98fc-4b63-a95d-e39dc6234a10', '7fdbc604-0b03-4c22-b759-457890f6f0a0', '9970da0b-826d-4603-8543-e82890cec29f', '9e0c7d24-682f-4614-b289-16e8c7ac68b0', 'a8cf9126-606b-408d-b3a8-32b0b8aabf48', 'ba73d4d7-fbed-40ff-a98c-7a5649b4389b', 'c76dfc08-3f10-4b1c-af3a-fcbc066b10af', 'd8116977-0962-4d4d-832d-f9b0a095c75c', 'e0105d82-0b9b-42c2-a2ad-e18e9d897859', 'e3ac4748-9f29-43e1-8abe-029cd925690c', 'fde8154b-d81f-440d-912f-aecef31810c7']",On the Convergence of Constrained Particle Filters,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,2017
277,"The frequency-domain adaptive filter (FDAF) is widely used in echo cancellation systems due to its low complexity and fast convergence rate. However, the FDAF algorithm with a fixed step size exhibits a tradeoff among the convergence rate, steady-state misalignment, tracking ability, and robustness to near-end speech interferences. Several variable step-size FDAF algorithms were presented to address this problem. However, the state-of-the-art variable step-size FDAF algorithms did not handle this problem comprehensively. This paper presents a new robust variable step-size control approach to the FDAF algorithm. Based on a statistical analysis of the FDAF algorithm, an optimal step size for each frequency bin is derived by minimizing the mean-square deviation (MSD) between the true weight vector and estimated weight vector at each frame. Calculation of the step size requires the system distance and the observation noise power spectral density (PSD). The system distance is estimated using the deterministic recursive equations of MSD and the noise PSD is computed using the magnitude squared coherence function between the far-end signal and error signal. Moreover, a close link between the proposed FDAF and the frequency-domain Kalman filter is revealed. Specifically, the work presented here can be understood as a means to adaptively monitor and control the underlying acoustic state space of the Kalman filter, including means for fast readaptation of the adaptive filter after abrupt echo path changes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve fast convergence and low steady-state misalignment. Furthermore, the algorithm is robust to the double-talk interferences, but it does not require an explicit double-talk detector.","['Feiran Yang', 'Gerald Enzner', 'Jun Yang']",74fb5f45-aa90-41aa-bb45-db8f538e6f4e,0,"['0479e5db-ba8b-4ba3-b0d4-037e84a91336', '0b2f2e88-0caf-4374-8443-cac63fc19882', '1377b277-655a-4b44-9181-2e28c12aa5a4', '1a28a5a2-e0a1-42f0-a576-c062fd4c5b37', '2b499115-db6a-4fab-8c12-8fa5463f60ca', '47b40302-8d25-4556-86b5-91a43e79bada', '521f3642-170f-4771-a51b-f339ebcda18b', '8263dd64-1d65-4d32-820c-afcd3aebcd47', '9c464645-4789-49fd-be04-158abfb78179', 'a6199300-3815-4d2a-869d-5cf2269432d9', 'a8f01d6f-d90f-481c-b0d1-1f2d239c34b0', 'abdd8d77-11e6-4eb3-b859-3bfa39b062c3', 'bd27bb2e-8c79-4fe9-866e-75a359444ccd', 'cd77c6b7-21d2-4b62-a02f-12a06e67cf61', 'da0a5fc5-fcd7-467d-aa71-274fd4766b4f', 'e9189d94-d18f-40d9-9043-74c650f652a6']",Statistical Convergence Analysis for Optimal Control of DFT-Domain Adaptive Echo Canceler,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",2017

Taking advantage of a fast algorithm for computing min-plus convolutions based on the decomposition of the function into concave and convex parts, we show that the numerical scheme can be implemented in a very efficient way.","['Anne Bouillard', 'Erwan Faou', 'Maxime Zavidovique']",a5903353-4a63-4dea-b798-94019901c8f9,0,"['0d27012b-9ce8-4f07-995f-a4b4ab4f0084', '126ed750-6c11-4637-83fa-f73d7b237ec9', '30f76ac0-a3d0-416a-8aee-7a14436e566f', '3c2103ae-ea42-4ee7-b50a-5bc6b336173f', 'ac435270-ff48-409f-89fd-2d70f14ab53a', 'b39c4fc4-a6f5-499d-b4b1-1a8fa76ed4d1', 'cd737d00-b06b-4245-b548-9b6683e94bd5', 'e36b5791-ca8e-4aa3-89aa-0b83937d334a']",Fast weak-KAM integrators for separable Hamiltonian systems,Mathematics of Computation,2016
279,"A novel natural scene text detection method is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, first, we extract MSERs as text candidates with a proper multi-channel and multi-resolution Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MC–MR MSER) strategy. Then, we design a coarse-to-fine character classifier to discard false-positive candidates, where the coarse filter is based on morphological features and the fine filter is well-trained by convolutional neural network. Finally, text strings are formed with a graph model on detected characters. The proposed method is evaluated on ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Competition benchmark database and the practical challenging multi-orientation scene text database (USTB) with standard rules. Experimental results show our method is efficient and effective. It achieves  F-Score  at 83.84% on ICDAR 2013 database and 51.15% on the more challenging USTB database, which are superior over several state-of-the-art text detection methods.","['Chunna Tian', 'Y.-Y.

280,"High positioning accuracy and system integrity are crucial for the Sea-based Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (SB-JPALS) to ensure life safety in carrier landing. The antenna motion of shipboard receivers may introduce large positioning error, which is one of the primary failure modes affecting the SB-JPALS integrity. Multimodal data fusion based on dual-frequency GPS observables and antenna motion information is applied to monitor the failure and enables the system to alarm message once position domain error caused by antenna movement exceeds a threshold. Monitoring algorithm uses multiple reference station architecture, selects integrated translating error of all valid reference antennas as the monitor measurement, and establishes a monitor decision-making model based on fault vertical protection level to evaluate the integrity performance. Multiple antenna motion errors are fused to be the integrated translating error and relevant methodology is described. Firstly the associated equation is built between individual antenna motion error and inter-antenna baseline motion error. The latter is regarded as known variables due to feasibility to capture them on the mobile ship platform. Then each antenna motion error is calculated and projected onto satellite line-of-sight direction. Finally the integrated error is obtained by averaging all antenna motion errors. The experiment data analysis result shows that individual antenna motion error derived from inter-antenna baseline errors is consistent with its real value, and the vertical protection level of the integrated translating error computed by multimodal data fusion processing based on multiple reference antennas is smaller than that by individual antenna information, namely, the system achieves better integrity.","['Tao Feng', 'Xia Mao']",0c068ce4-5ba5-4377-9dcf-f9df3a70db55,0,"['314f9d83-7b5f-42da-9387-ffe183f30565', '638ae38d-2880-4c40-8bfc-86510ec17c96', '862f9bac-d4d2-4095-85d2-fb35998e44e5', 'caaff64a-e3cb-4f06-a292-34994f34417c', 'ccb8fc26-1f70-4ea0-a0d7-2f8dcf94d91b', 'df95af9e-cc41-49ec-addc-5dbeb2162854']",Multimodal data fusion for SB-JPALS status prediction under antenna motion fault mode,Neurocomputing,2017
281,"To prevent large interconnected power system from a cascading failure, brownout or even blackout, grid operators require access to faster than real-time information to make appropriate just-in-time control decisions. However, the communication and computational system limitations of currently used supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system can only deliver delayed information. However, the deployment of synchrophasor measurement devices makes it possible to capture and visualize, in near-real-time, grid operational data with extra granularity.

The distributed and scalable computing unit of the CCN framework makes it particularly flexible for customization for a particular set of prediction requirements. Two soft-computing algorithms have been implemented in the CCN framework: a cellular generalized neuron network (CCGNN) and a cellular multi-layer perceptron network (CCMLPN), for purposes of providing multi-timescale frequency predictions, ranging from 16.67 ms to 2 s. These two developed CCGNN and CCMLPN systems were then implemented on two different scales of power systems, one of which installed a large photovoltaic plant. A real-time power system simulator at weather station within the Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems (RTPIS) laboratory at Clemson, SC, was then used to derive typical FSI results.","['Yawei Wei', 'Ganesh K.

The control objective of the system is to move the end effector from any initial position to any target position with a specified posture. First, the integrability of the PAAA manipulator is analyzed based on its dynamic model. Then, the control process is divided into three stages based on the partial integrability of a PAAA system and the complete integrability of an Acrobot system. In each stage, the system is reduced to be an Acrobot-like system, and an angle constraint between an actuated joint and the unactuated one is derived based on the complete integrability of an Acrobot system. Next, a mathematical optimization model is constructed to solve the target angles based on multiconstraints and the control objective. And GA is applied to obtain the target angles. Finally, the controllers are designed for each stage to move one actuated joint to the target angle in turn.

To solve this task we can use an index to speed up the searching. Among the current indices, the permutant based searching approach has proved its efficiency for high-dimensional data before, however up to now this approach had not been adapted to work with low-dimensional data where the approach seemed useless. We propose several ways to adapt the permutant searching approach for low-dimensional data, using zones varying the distribution of the radii, trying different distance measures, and using partial distance computation as well.

289,"Underwater wireless communications refer to data transmission in unguided water environment through wireless carriers, i.e., radio-frequency (RF) wave, acoustic wave, and optical wave. In comparison to RF and acoustic counterparts, underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) can provide a much higher transmission bandwidth and much higher data rate. Therefore, we focus, in this paper, on the UOWC that employs optical wave as the transmission carrier. In recent years, many potential applications of UOWC systems have been proposed for environmental monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster precaution, and military operations. However, UOWC systems also suffer from severe absorption and scattering introduced by underwater channels. In order to overcome these technical barriers, several new system design approaches, which are different from the conventional terrestrial free-space optical communication, have been explored in recent years. We provide a comprehensive and exhaustive survey of the state-of-the-art UOWC research in three aspects: 1) channel characterization; 2) modulation; and 3) coding techniques, together with the practical implementations of UOWC.","['Zhaoquan Zeng', 'Shu Fu', 'Huihui Zhang', 'Yuhan Dong', 'Julian Cheng']",523e8456-b2e5-4aba-aeb4-ff5864707421,50,"['0d8e3eb0-92e1-4f04-b36d-18e88549b8bf', '24fe1a53-8622-43f5-b596-0ef9cef1d65f', '259de8e7-a1a3-4d06-802a-6301ff6ed1d9', '3916ef78-5cbb-4c6b-a169-0b79d61bf010', '3c6f95d3-8519-4855-8799-3cc8d2be5baf', '654f7537-e19a-43ea-8e0b-91b7fbc49e06', '66bf0d1a-1b86-4253-80f5-cc632655cd20', '6911999f-6dd8-4436-87e9-761eca7d5e17', '700daac4-712f-4b68-8cba-a97155348e7a', '724bf123-91db-4d83-9d40-a4eb081fc882', '77c264ea-a074-4d47-b884-536902c0893f', '7a44f9d3-c31b-4be3-80fb-15bb6e7e3252', '7dd58b54-8607-4b27-9002-8830c58439f8', '8450c601-c101-4046-8f1d-be4ae3b448e2', '86fd117e-1f09-44e3-afb7-3e498200e145', '88691075-b49f-45d8-9e52-b98b14fa3cc2', '8978d478-58d6-49f8-83c8-74c58cabb110', '8adf7789-402b-4f1f-b693-6d732fb3f3b2', '923364d6-7f8e-4546-a00c-561543682f3d', '958ec028-529e-4de1-874f-5ed9fea5dd3f', 'a0b562d0-08b2-466a-9267-da3f58edc18b', 'a49c5231-5770-4265-885f-6109fcef03ef', 'a97765ef-aaaa-4bf7-af7a-f357910f1bb5', 'b1b761cb-4f8f-41ea-a84b-bb844d0dd4cd', 'b7d3ea18-82d4-4eda-89dc-573d56f9ae99', 'c2398c0a-2b08-429a-bdfc-9696bd491d55', 'c6e5ae55-5a78-4b8c-96b6-bccaa36e27e2', 'c8e718a8-587a-4031-ab46-5cfc81c5919c', 'cd0af69a-4226-4dc3-ac37-dbdc498fafe6', 'da7ceeb0-c8af-4457-a57a-6bd9dfc15ab7', 'ecbca5c2-e943-4d9d-9492-9d34cc7c108a', 'f035c795-653e-4a7a-a46f-36c27d42cfea', 'f80e9ec9-e32e-4986-807c-1e2cc1d66458', 'fc33620e-4a53-44a9-be24-7f31f5b14897']",A Survey of Underwater Optical Wireless Communications,IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials,2017
290,"Background#R##N#The diagnostic work-up of Alzheimer Disease (AD) is complex, time-consuming, expensive, and quite demanding for the patients. Therefore, there is a growing need for simple non-invasive tools that add to the diagnostic work-up of patients.#R##N#Objectives#R##N#This paper investigates a new method for monitoring motor functions in AD using everyday interactions related to writing with a computer, i.c. executing a copy task.#R##N#Methods#R##N#An experimental exploratory study was set up in which a carefully designed copy task was presented to three groups of participants: young adults (n = 20), cognitively healthy elderly (n = 20) and age-matched elderly with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD (n = 12). The task consisted of ten different sub-tasks in which specific bigram characteristics were manipulated. The participants' typing behavior was monitored with keystroke logging.#R##N#Results#R##N#The three groups differed significantly from each other in performing the copy task. Typing speed gradually decreased with age. Moreover, the cognitively impaired age-matched adults performed slower on all subtasks expressed in longer interkey intervals within the targeted bigrams. Integrative multilevel modelling showed that all the manipulated bigram characteristics contributed significantly to the model.#R##N#Conclusion#R##N#This explorative study shows the potential relevance of using a typing copy task in the diagnostic work-up of patients with neurodegenerative brain disorders. It relates to a natural task, is non-invasive and easy to automatize. In comparison to other motor tasks it allows for fine-grained measurements at an individual level and combines different aspects of complex and fine motor activities in one task.","['Luuk Van Waes', 'Mariëlle Leijten', 'Peter Mariën', 'Sebastiaan Engelborghs']",e7917ef2-b945-4b78-b367-d6f8876d7d29,0,"['2d485135-20db-486c-b223-fde5771e7c22', '3e055a24-ad08-4d1e-bbf3-9a45edf13b95', '4942b28a-07e0-42d0-a138-2089e001a2fa', '7d65db54-a85b-4ddd-9a44-9f3a27a2d9ac', 'feb400e7-de27-4529-991a-5d52ebb7e81c']",Typing competencies in Alzheimer's disease: An exploration of copy tasks,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
291,"This paper focuses on the problem of adaptive tracking control for a class of switched strict-feedback nonlinear systems with unknown time-varying delays and asymmetric saturation actuators under arbitrary switching. Especially, the considered time-varying delays absolutely depend on the subsystem number. The main technical difficulties lie in finding an appropriate common Lyapunov function (CLF) for all subsystems and designing a common adaptive control scheme in the presence of unknown time-varying delays and asymmetric saturation nonlinearities. Based on a novel combination of Lyapunov–Razumikhin method, dynamic surface control (DSC) technique, variable separation approach and neural network (NN) approximation, a simple quadratical CLF is constructed and a common adaptive control scheme involving only one adaptive parameter is developed. The proposed controller guarantees that all signals of closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) while the tracking error converges to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin. Finally, the effectiveness of the design methodology is illustrated with two simulation examples.","['Zhaoxu Yu', 'Yan Dong', 'Shugang Li', 'Fangfei Li']",416692e0-e58d-45ac-b392-37942c8b26c9,0,"['05f79af3-cc32-4214-8d0f-2f7bccf9cae3', '2fb4e729-5244-44f8-b10f-383bf0166656', '35cb6ce5-8ce1-40ab-a6ac-6d9d6201d474', '3c3225bc-dcb1-4699-88d8-1b334e026098', '473967fb-4cd4-44fc-8177-db547e98c8aa', '56b3585c-119a-4045-b562-05df3809eccc', '570a7e91-b353-44c2-ba5a-49c8e9a182df', '58f075b7-341d-4afd-aff9-7542d18072b8', '615d37c5-416e-4108-8175-59589acccb73', '70d7866e-91cc-4d14-bcf8-f66187239ed5', '7aefdb89-17c9-4d16-96ee-5eb44e82cf81', '924f4ca1-1037-46eb-8e82-981334cf47bc', '94a0fbda-033b-4e0a-a33f-0987968a57de', 'a5efaa4a-c842-407b-9f0b-b4f17e9b990d', 'b0ed0199-a528-428d-8845-423e180c43ae', 'bfa998ff-984b-4797-9368-865278fe73a4', 'c000f384-34d6-4e25-b609-a6dcd4ca073b', 'c2b8f0b1-d7b4-45c1-9f25-0aca3e0761fb', 'd89eb977-f749-4432-9170-1624ce4be411', 'e1382437-abbc-4587-831e-fce5d2892ed2', 'edc72b01-a50b-4e58-9afb-d204738e0f6f', 'ef919a58-9617-4a43-9400-19836dc94236', 'f7b48ad4-82d4-4fad-b91c-c31e1b33fabf', 'f8872473-38f7-4c4c-82e9-7746fb028444']",Adaptive tracking control for switched strict-feedback nonlinear systems with time-varying delays and asymmetric saturation actuators,Neurocomputing,2017

293,"We study preconditioned algorithms of alternating direction method of multipliers type for nonsmooth optimization problems. The alternating direction method of multipliers is a popular first-order method for general constrained optimization problems. However, one of its drawbacks is the need to solve implicit subproblems. In various applications, these subproblems are either easily solvable or linear, but nevertheless challenging. We derive a preconditioned version that allows for flexible and efficient preconditioning for these linear subproblems. The original and preconditioned version is written as a new kind of proximal point method for the primal problem, and the weak (strong) convergence in infinite (finite) dimensional Hilbert spaces is proved. Various efficient preconditioners with any number of inner iterations may be used in this preconditioned framework. Furthermore, connections between the preconditioned version and the recently introduced preconditioned Douglas–Rachford method for general nonsmooth problems involving quadratic–linear terms are established. The methods are applied to total variation denoising problems, and their benefits are shown in numerical experiments.","['Kristian Bredies', 'Hongpeng Sun']",10cd26ae-4c3b-41ef-87a8-788f1cbcf584,50,"['20046276-3e3b-44e2-876f-cfcb1435c329', '222a6691-bab9-47ed-b96f-29b548152bf4', '29157a6c-c972-4a8d-b3bf-424b4151549f', '29675511-d103-49f0-9142-18ea2213b106', '4d63f091-cf88-4d67-82cc-e02695f0ee4a', '52e55346-2fb4-45a8-9e50-db06f3343982', '678638d8-e525-42b5-83c9-36872383847d', '6d263589-e3d5-45f8-8159-faff0f21c319', '6e6842a7-0033-43e5-8943-b5dfaa8fe18a', '8b1da533-6c6a-4f4c-aa1a-aa4369a94654', '996a6648-7a1f-4bff-a9f8-438ffa990dce', '9b166075-5b89-4ec5-91db-47e5ca47c7ec', 'b8321e4f-ccae-433a-984e-7567535ff293', 'd1c4f1e5-0858-461b-bf51-afdfe96584b3', 'd5d0ecc4-b9ef-4260-b766-7fa197f58e76', 'e537d143-155e-4ca0-8ae8-66b777a77fea', 'fa55a276-4ae1-4620-8adc-76d274a7910d', 'fe252ade-99f7-46c9-80b2-0fcdf2fe112a']",A Proximal Point Analysis of the Preconditioned Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers,Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2017
294,"Cooperative spectrum sensing is a key technique for cognitive radio networks, in which cooperative user selection is vital to reduce overhead and ensure high detection performance. In this paper we proposed a hybrid user selection scheme, which takes into consideration of user mobility and heterogeneity. Mobility, which increases the spatial diversity, affects the user stability and correlation. The characteristics which users with different number of antennas reflect is called heterogeneity. Heterogeneity affects the user’s detection capability. The scheme ensures the optimal users to provide a high cooperative spectrum sensing performance based on the user’s own constraint in mobile heterogeneous cognitive radio. The simulation and analysis results show that the user selection is tradeoff between diversity gain and sensing reliability. Spatial diversity improves the spectrum sensing performance under sensing reliability, while mobility degrades the detection performance when the users step out of the primary protected region (PPR). If the users are always inside the PPR, we select the users whose characteristics are as follows: their speeds are as fast as possible, correlation among them is as small as possible, and their detection capability is as great as possible. Therefore, the proposed scheme is suitable both in the static and mobile cognitive radios.","['Meimei Duan', 'Zhimin Zeng', 'Caili Guo', 'Fangfang Liu']",f9099821-43a7-41f8-bbbc-7a05fe134372,0,"['2164ce48-6e63-45a9-8b2c-37d96d587ae0', '361ded8d-2e33-45bd-a396-6169f06312dd', '43a3a132-4b79-41f4-9671-9b47b0ccef9c', '68f3a7d4-d842-4d5f-ab20-f20b8a43444d', '6f19162d-fd77-4b8f-bca5-ab5df799a529', '7b0c7359-14eb-4e7d-bfc9-342cb1708af3', '9ab5eac0-2eff-4870-8b7f-a0748f3ad199', '9aca5a3a-945d-43ea-823f-37a5a35573e5', 'ac99aca9-8344-4605-9e2d-aac01d2c7b90', 'afc191aa-223b-42a5-b137-1b5422d98ad2', 'b122029a-688b-480e-b811-b8b8ebc36553', 'b5f16e05-7a90-4a8d-900d-c4a74f01241a', 'b6e954e0-f2d7-48d5-baf0-0dab0d2344c5', 'c5f31872-de47-4b19-b527-351844ff68f7', 'd9482b4b-9409-415d-aa07-eceb075bbf2d', 'e6a15cfd-755e-4f05-b47c-e77190473a9b', 'e87559e4-5001-4ebd-8f15-f8fd99b62814']",User Selection for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Mobile Heterogeneous Cognitive Radios,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
295,"With the prevalence of the cloud computing, data owners can outsource their data to the cloud server to enjoy convenient services. To ensure the user's data confidentiality, the outsourced data are usually stored in an encryption form on the cloud server, which makes it extremely difficult to search the specific encrypted documents matching some keywords from the cloud server for users. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a multi-keyword ranked search scheme over encrypted cloud data, which also supports search results verification. To achieve efficient multi-keyword search, we construct a special data structure QSet based on an inverted index structure. To reduce the search complexity, we use the strategy that firstly searching the estimated least frequent keyword in the query to significantly narrow down the number of searching documents. Within this framework, to support ranked search, we utilize the common   TF×IDF      TF  ×  IDF         rule to compute the relevance scores of documents matching a given search request.

297,"In this paper we explore arbitrarily high-order Lagrange collocation-type time-stepping schemes for effectively solving high-dimensional nonlinear Klein–Gordon equations with different boundary conditions. We begin with one-dimensional periodic boundary problems and first formulate an abstract ordinary differential equation (ODE) on a suitable infinity-dimensional function space based on the operator spectrum theory. We then introduce an operator-variation-of-constants formula which is essential for the derivation of our arbitrarily high-order Lagrange collocation-type time-stepping schemes for the nonlinear abstract ODE. The nonlinear stability and convergence are rigorously analysed once the spatial differential operator is approximated by an appropriate positive semi-definite matrix under some suitable smoothness assumptions. With regard to the two dimensional Dirichlet or Neumann boundary problems, our new time-stepping schemes coupled with discrete Fast Sine / Cosine Transformation can be applied to simulate the two-dimensional nonlinear Klein–Gordon equations effectively. All essential features of the methodology are present in one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases, although the schemes to be analysed lend themselves with equal to higher-dimensional case. The numerical simulation is implemented and the numerical results clearly demonstrate the advantage and effectiveness of our new schemes in comparison with the existing numerical methods for solving nonlinear Klein–Gordon equations in the literature.","['Changying Liu', 'Xinyuan Wu']",33684b66-279a-41a8-a557-9246c9d36270,0,"['0759e9fa-9612-4c7a-8f7f-dcb2d3ac1f34', '0e8913c6-4664-4e29-b4a0-f22e8b7eef76', '2419a344-925f-42fd-8628-d10db782d49e', '3b9e20c6-3fc2-43f2-a4d1-7b9c21a00a79', '6f1eb1a7-f388-44a0-8e05-65375e696f77', '94bb0f68-0bd9-41e1-9012-5048a89f0b2e', 'bfc71ea0-2894-41c4-9d20-6969e3135800', 'c08d4f67-e814-4956-844f-a2c046b4fc85', 'c431c1ef-e5fc-4f16-9450-c6f747a49660', 'cc741d21-2354-4ce2-a8f4-64f09cf00c14', 'df2f0452-71c0-4611-b4e2-71ca0eb864f4', 'f689a1bb-5a98-4f8b-a285-04b24a339fb9']",Arbitrarily high-order time-stepping schemes based on the operator spectrum theory for high-dimensional nonlinear Klein–Gordon equations ☆,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
298,"It is essential for a robot to be able to detect revisits or loop closures for long-term visual navigation. A key insight explored in this work is that the loop-closing event inherently occurs sparsely, i.e., the image currently being taken matches with only a small subset (if any) of previous images. Based on this observation, we formulate the problem of loop-closure detection as a sparse, convex  l1l1-minimization problem. By leveraging fast convex optimization techniques, we are able to efficiently find loop closures, thus enabling real-time robot navigation. This novel formulation requires no offline dictionary learning, as required by most existing approaches, and thus allows online incremental operation. Our approach ensures a unique hypothesis by choosing only a single globally optimal match when making a loop-closure decision. Furthermore, the proposed formulation enjoys a flexible representation with no restriction imposed on how images should be represented, while requiring only that the representations are “close” to each other when the corresponding images are visually similar. The proposed algorithm is validated extensively using real-world datasets.","['Yasir Latif', 'Guoquan Huang', 'John J. Leonard', 'José L.

299,"Passive millimeter wave (PMMW) imaging system forms images through passive detection of millimeter wave radiations emitted from the objects. This system allows detection of invisible characteristics of a scene. The important characteristic of these waves is their penetration into cloth fibers and bad climatic conditions such as mist, rain and smoke. These waves are able to detect objects (particularly metal objects) hidden in cloths. For this reason, imaging system is applied in security section of the airports. This system has also abundant applications in military, meteorology, navigation industries in low vision and medical industries. In airports and generally the places where there is need for physical inspection of people, millimeter wave scanners are used. These devices are able to detect weapon and other objects hanging on body of the person or hidden in clothes. Due to limitation of dimensions of lens and antenna and limitation of light refraction, images obtained from this system have low resolution. Imaging in this system acts as a low-pass filter. For this reason, high-frequency information of these images is removed; therefore, set of actions is necessary for improving quality of these images. Different methods have been presented for increasing quality of these images which are divided into two classes of retrieval and combination or fusion of image (for example, fusion of PMMW image with visible image). Target of this paper is to present a new method for fusion of millimeter wave images with their visible images with their visible images with contourlet transform and a new method in thresholding; so that the output image includes visual information very close to visible image which contains object hidden from millimeter wave image.","['M.

300,"Calcium is involved in important intracellular processes, such as intracellular signaling from cell membrane receptors to the nucleus. Typically calcium levels are kept at less than 100 nM in the nucleus and cytosol but some calcium is stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen for rapid release to activate intracellular calcium-dependent functions. Stromal Interacting Molecule 1 (STIM1) plays a critical role in early sensing of changes in the ER’s calcium level, especially when there is a sudden release of stored calcium from the ER. Inactive STIM1, which has a bound calcium ion, is activated upon ion release. Following activation of STIM1, there is STIM1-assisted initiation of extracellular calcium entry through channels in the cell membrane. This extracellular calcium entering the cell then amplifies intracellular calcium-dependent actions. At the end of the process, ER levels of stored calcium are reestablished. The main focus of this work was to study the conformational changes accompanying homo-...","['Sreya Mukherjee', 'Aleksandra Karolak', 'Marjolaine Debant', 'Paul Buscaglia', 'Yves Renaudineau', 'Olivier Mignen', 'Wayne C.

301,"Information from exergy cost analysis can be effectively used in the design and management of modern district heating networks (DHNs) since it allows to properly account for the irreversibilities in energy conversion and distribution. Nevertheless, this requires the development of suitable graph-based approaches that are able to effectively consider the network topology and the variations of the physical properties of the heating fluid on a time-dependent basis. In this work, a formulation of exergetic costs suitable for large graph-based networks is proposed, which is consistent with the principles of exergetic costing. In particular, the approach is more compact in comparison to straightforward approaches of exergetic cost formulation available in the literature, especially when applied to fluid networks. Moreover, the proposed formulation is specifically considering transient operating conditions, which is a crucial feature and a necessity for the analysis of future DHNs. Results show that transient effects of the thermodynamic behavior are not negligible for exergy cost analysis, while this work offers a coherent approach to quantify them.","['Stefano Coss', 'Elisa Guelpa', 'Etienne Letournel', 'Olivier Le-Corre', 'Vittorio Verda']",d4d6e63d-1539-41ae-af74-ab4c4ce665df,0,[],Formulation of Exergy Cost Analysis to Graph-Based Thermal Network Models,Entropy,2017
302,"Distributional data, expressed as realizations of distributional variables, are new types of data arising from several sources. In this paper, we present some new fuzzy c-means algorithms for data described by distributional variables. The algorithms use the  L  2  Wasserstein distance between distributions as dissimilarity measure. Usually, in fuzzy c-means, all the variables are considered equally important in the clustering task. However, some variables could be more or less important or even irrelevant for this task. Considering a decomposition of the squared  L  2  Wasserstein distance, and using the notion of adaptive distance, we propose some algorithms for automatically computing relevance weights associated with variables, as well as with their components. This is done for the whole dataset or cluster-wise. Relevance weights express the importance of each variable, or of each component, in the clustering process acting also as a variable selection method. Using artificial and real-world data, we observed that algorithms with automatic weighting of variables (or components) are better able to take into account the cluster structure of data.","['Antonio Irpino', 'Rosanna Verde', 'Francisco de A.

303,"This paper investigates capability and efficiency of utilizing the inverse dynamics in the virtual domain (IDVD) method to provide the real-time updates of feasible trajectory for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during underwater docking operations. The applicability of the IDVD method is examined for two scenarios. For the first scenario, referred to as an offline scenario, a nominal trajectory may be generated ahead of time based on a priori knowledge about the docking station (DS) pose (position and orientation). The second scenario, referred to as an online scenario, assumes some uncertainty in the DS pose; hence, the reference trajectory needs to be constantly recomputed in real time based on the updates about the DS pose. The offline scenario solution serves as a benchmark solution to check feasibility and optimality of generated trajectory subject to constraints on the states and controls. In particular, the offline solution can assist in making informed trade-off decisions between optimality of solution and computational efficiency. For the relatively simple offline scenario, the IDVD-method solution is compared with the Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto pseudo-spectral (LGLPS) method solution. The software-in-the-loop simulations and Monte Carlo trials are run for robustness assessment. Finally, the potential for the IDVD method to work online, in a closed-loop guidance system, is explored using a realistic cluttered operational simulation environment. Simulation results show that the IDVD-method based guidance system guarantees a reliable and efficient docking process by generating computationally efficient, feasible and ready to be tracked trajectories.","['Amir Mehdi Yazdani', 'Karl Sammut', 'Oleg A.

We show that the class of directed temperature-1 RTAM systems is not computationally universal, which is conjectured but unproven for the aTAM, and like the aTAM, the RTAM is computationally universal at temperature 2. We then show that at temperature 1, when starting from a single tile seed, the RTAM is capable of assembling \(n \times n\) squares for n odd using only n tile types, but incapable of assembling \(n \times n\) squares for n even. Moreover, we show that n is a lower bound on the number of tile types needed to assemble \(n \times n\) squares for n odd in the temperature-1 RTAM. The conjectured lower bound for temperature-1 aTAM systems is \(2n-1\).

305,"Despite their potential to reduce or remedy the impact of cyberbullying, most bystanders do not intervene in witnessed incidents. Social cognitive theory suggests this response is due to interactive influences of personal, behavioural and environmental factors, and further shaped by the social and cultural context. However, this has not been empirically tested in cyberbullying bystanders. In this study, 563 grade 7 and 9 students completed a survey to examine the associations between intervention and morality, at the individual and peer-group levels. Results revealed that intervention was significantly associated with gender, grade, previous experiences of cyberbullying, and the interaction between individual and collective moral variables. More frequent intervention was reported by females, grade 7 students, and those with more experience as victims and witnesses of cyberbullying. Finally, collective moral disengagement moderated the effects of individual morality. In disengaged classes, higher moral standards were associated with more frequent intervention; furthermore, in extremely morally disengaged classes, higher moral disengagement was associated with more frequent intervention. These results suggest that consistent with social cognitive theory, individuals' perceptions of social norms moderate the influence of individual morality on intervention.","['Kimberley R.

306,"We present an effective asymptotic method for approximating the density of particles for kinetic equations with a Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK) relaxation operator in the large scale hyperbolic limit. The density of particles is transformed via a Hopf–Cole transformation, where the phase function is expanded as a power series with respect to the Knudsen number. The expansion terms can be determined by solving a sequence of equations. In particular, it has been proved in   [3]   that the leading order term is the viscosity solution of an effective Hamilton–Jacobi equation, and we show that the higher order terms can be formally determined by solving a sequence of transport equations. Both the effective Hamilton–Jacobi equation and the transport equations are independent of the Knudsen number, and are formulated in the physical space, where the effective Hamiltonian is obtained as the solution of a nonlinear equation that is given as an integral in the velocity variable, and the coefficients of the transport equations are given as integrals in the velocity variable. With appropriate Gauss quadrature rules for evaluating these integrals effectively, the effective Hamilton–Jacobi equation and the transport equations can be solved efficiently to obtain the expansion terms for approximating the density function. In this work, the zeroth, first and second order terms in the expansion are used to obtain second order accuracy with respect to the Knudsen number. The proposed method balances efficiency and accuracy, and has the potential to deal with kinetic equations with more general BGK models. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Songting Luo', 'Nicholas Payne']",9ee89c44-38af-428f-9927-aec45294e467,0,"['3cd4f02f-14d7-442a-b838-7d374ae92652', 'b9e2c4bf-a9b0-492b-9bb0-be2cd8acc0d8', 'c73dabef-e003-47b3-834c-5f9d31440735', 'fe52b497-32ca-488d-8261-703aac5757cb']",An asymptotic method based on a Hopf–Cole transformation for a kinetic BGK equation in the hyperbolic limit ☆,Journal of Computational Physics,2017

At the end of each course, students are requested to evaluate various aspects such as activities, methodology, coordination or resources used. In addition, a final qualification is given to summarize the quality of the course. The prediction of this final qualification can be accomplished by using monotonic classification techniques. The outcome offered by these surveys is particularly significant for faculty and teaching staff associated with the course.#R##N##R##N#The monotonic nearest neighbor classifier is one of the most relevant algorithms in monotonic classification. However, it does suffer from two drawbacks, (a) inefficient execution time in classification and (b) sensitivity to no monotonic examples. Prototype selection is a data reduction process for classification based on nearest neighbor that can be used to alleviate these problems. This paper proposes a prototype selection algorithm called Monotonic Iterative Prototype Selection (MONIPS) algorithm. Our objective is two-fold. The first one is to introduce MONIPS as a method for obtaining monotonic solutions. MONIPS has proved to be competitive with classical prototype selection solutions adapted to monotonic domain. Besides, to further demonstrate the good performance of MONIPS in the context of a student survey about taught courses.","['José-Ramón Cano', 'Naif Radi Aljohani', 'Rabeeh Ayaz Abbasi', 'Jalal S.

In order to ensure a high-level of accuracy and to meet the real-time requirement, a fast collision detection algorithm between soft bodies is proposed. The developed algorithm is a combination of stochastic methods and particle swarm optimization with adaptive Cauchy mutation. The hierarchical bounding box method is used for a rough detection in order to filter out obvious disjoint space, and the problem is converted to a nonlinear optimization problem based on the distance of points. Then particle swarm optimization with adaptive Cauchy mutation is used to find the optimal solution. When it is updated iteratively, keeping some particles experience value and variation of other particles avoids particles trapped in local optimum, which further accelerates the speed of collision detection. The algorithm is implemented and evaluated through experiments and the results confirm the advantages of the developed algorithm.","['Yanni Zou', 'Peter X.

The literature has thus far primarily focused on disturbance rejection, steady-state optimality and adaption to complex physical system models without considering uncertainties on the cyber and communication layer nor their effect on robustness and performance. In this paper, we derive sufficient delay-dependent conditions for robust stability of a secondary-frequency-DAI-controlled power system with respect to heterogeneous communication delays, link failures and packet losses. Our analysis takes into account both constant as well as fast-varying delays, and it is based on a common strictly decreasing Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional. The conditions illustrate an inherent trade-off between robustness and performance of DAI controllers.

312,"Presently, a tetrahedral mesher based on the Delaunay triangulation approach may outperform a tetrahedral improver based on local smoothing and flip operations by nearly one order in terms of computing time. Parallelization is a feasible way to speed up the improver and enable it to handle large-scale meshes. In this study, a novel domain decomposition approach is proposed for parallel mesh improvement. It analyses the dual graph of the input mesh to build an inter-domain boundary that avoids small dihedral angles and poorly shaped faces. Consequently, the parallel improver can fit this boundary without compromising the mesh quality. Meanwhile, the new method does not involve any inter-processor communications and therefore runs very efficiently. A parallel pre-processing pipeline that combines the proposed improver and existing parallel surface and volume meshers can prepare a quality mesh containing hundreds of millions of elements in minutes. Experiments are presented to show that the developed system is robust and applicable to models of a complication level experienced in industry.","['Jianjun Chen', 'Dawei Zhao', 'Yao Zheng', 'Y.Z.

316,"We present a collision model for phase-resolved Direct Numerical Simulations of sediment transport that couple the fluid and particles by the Immersed Boundary Method. Typically, a contact model for these types of simulations comprises a lubrication force for particles in close proximity to another solid object, a normal contact force to prevent particles from overlapping, and a tangential contact force to account for friction. Our model extends the work of previous authors to improve upon the time integration scheme to obtain consistent results for particle–wall collisions. Furthermore, we account for polydisperse spherical particles and introduce new criteria to account for enduring contact, which occurs in many sediment transport situations. This is done without using arbitrary values for physically-defined parameters and by maintaining the full momentum balance of a particle in enduring contact. We validate our model against several test cases for binary particle–wall collisions as well as the collective motion of a sediment bed sheared by a viscous flow, yielding satisfactory agreement with experimental data by various authors.","['Edward Biegert', 'Bernhard Vowinckel', 'Eckart Meiburg']",cf247496-d3f3-49e8-b869-a746ea47b33a,0,"['002b7066-13da-4d17-b26e-20d863231942', '07cd3e4e-9253-41fd-964c-60b06ecc3c51', '5e32955b-ce18-40a2-b2fe-46f9a1fae972']","A collision model for grain-resolving simulations of flows over dense, mobile, polydisperse granular sediment beds",Journal of Computational Physics,2017

Firstly, we establish the existence and uniqueness results for a mean-field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with average delay. Then a class of mean-field time-advanced stochastic differential equations (ASDEs) is introduced as the adjoint equations via duality relation. Meanwhile, necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal control under partial information on infinite horizon are derived. Finally, we apply the theoretical results to study linear-quadratic control problem on infinite horizon to obtain the optimal control, which is explicitly expressed by the solution of a mean-field forward-backward stochastic differential filtering equation.","['Heping Ma', 'Bin Liu']",6109ed9d-1b26-4614-a265-b64184588c4e,0,"['b9c98308-b960-4eab-abf6-bb4002caa591', 'e6f0839e-4853-490e-aebb-32efb4448012', 'f3a550cb-5b01-4796-ac01-7e97bd572bd8']",Infinite horizon optimal control problem of mean-field backward stochastic delay differential equation under partial information,European Journal of Control,2017
318,"A Hopfield associative memory (HAM) is a major model of associative memory using neural networks. The classical HAM model has a low storage capacity. A pseudo-orthogonalized HAM (POHAM) was therefore proposed to improve storage capacity by encoding the training patterns to be pseudo-orthogonal. In the present work, we examine a different property of POHAM. A chaotic HAM (CHAM) can explore embedded patterns, including training patterns. Although it is not desirable to recall patterns other than training patterns, at a minimum, the reversed patterns are recalled. A POHAM regards the training and reversed patterns as equivalent. To take advantage of this property, we propose a chaotic POHAM (CPOHAM). We evaluated a CHAM and a CPOHAM using computer simulations. The CPOHAM never recalled the reversed patterns. In addition, the CPOHAM recalled very few other pseudo-memories, such as mixture patterns, due to the orthogonality of the encoded training patterns, while the CHAM frequently recalled the mixture patterns.",['Masaki Kobayashi'],e9dce9f9-d52a-46d4-88d1-2039ec2ea3ff,0,"['0108f1ca-db08-456c-8a0b-00f35d48a6d0', '145a5d3c-df90-47a1-bf26-ab4aeed02be6', '26b08a0b-d8d8-413d-9e20-abb647fbc740', '33c09979-56cb-4750-a55b-a46a3936c75e', '341e385e-7bb3-42c8-b2dc-dba81c675efc', '34e7fb49-653f-454d-b31b-1c23bca442d0', '41aab177-6ac3-4d7a-8fd0-d5757e94ff31', '4b40080c-0482-4de5-9135-b204a41dd51a', '68a1d07a-15cb-4c42-a921-ad5b64adbd46', '7eca08cc-365b-4b7a-b49f-ed9a5e9e7606', '991bb85a-f14e-418e-9155-305684f02c77', 'b66c18c6-3cfc-45cf-b7b9-bb31e3950117', 'c724eab4-8f2a-45e6-99d1-db8f1499ebeb', 'cb209f20-9fbd-4835-aff7-d288da704995', 'cf213add-2b9f-4499-8d2e-30c7e5288a92', 'd43813a7-c368-4a81-ba5d-045d394d8d5b', 'f9a36065-9d83-43fe-a085-c4352a73c5d8', 'ffaefcb4-fea4-480d-bbc1-cf57a8ece2ce']",Chaotic pseudo-orthogonalized Hopfield associative memory,Neurocomputing,2017

Due to the effect of channel estimation errors and feedback delays, however, channel uncertainties are inevitable in practical CRNs. In this paper, considering bounded uncertainties of channel gains, a robust power control algorithm is proposed to minimize the total transmit power of Secondary Users (SUs) subject to interference power constraint of primary user and quality of service constraint of SU where the non-convex optimization problem is converted into a convex optimization problem that is solved by using robust optimization theory. Computer experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing with the non-robust algorithm in the aspect of suppressing the effect of parameter perturbation.","['Yongjun Xu', 'Qianbin Chen', 'Xiaoge Huang']",b941eb86-03e1-4947-980d-174978d7ea5a,0,"['2eea85c2-cfd2-43a3-a835-e9ae7004d24a', '4168b5c6-7390-43ef-95a1-7143042a1db2', '5241572e-3d3e-4afd-ad3a-d2fc35083f4d', '6196396b-dcc3-425a-abcd-f940187287df', '61d65c0b-c6ff-4680-89ef-58ca92c69fe6', '62cfbb17-bea5-48e8-98f8-f9533fc9512f', '76e4dd60-2c05-4fcd-884b-4092e404e355', '972946a7-205b-468b-bcbe-48d1aa7ce878', 'd1ba534e-3f80-4366-bb83-be16006f9e18', 'd1f25caf-1b05-48de-94e9-cc56f95fbf93', 'e6bcec47-3c83-43cf-a673-3bbb6f1a0a07', 'f10a14bc-6374-462a-8c5a-74aa20db7e85', 'f1e74152-3f7c-4c44-b628-cdf47a17587f', 'fbbe8069-3fb1-45b2-a65b-45b3a1120ef2']",Robust Power Control for OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Networks with QoS Guarantee,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
321,"The production of biofuels is a process that requires the adjustment of multiple parameters. Performing experiments in which these parameters are changed and the outputs are analyzed is imperative, but the cost of these tests limits their number. For this reason, it is important to design models that can predict the different outputs with changing inputs, reducing the number of actual experiments to be completed. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is one of the most common methods for this task, but machine learning algorithms represent an interesting alternative. In the present study the predictive performance of multiple models built from the same problem data are compared: the production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials. Four machine learning algorithms, including two neural networks, a support vector machine and a fuzzy system, together with the RSM method, are analyzed. Results show that Reg-CO 2 RBFN, the method designed by the authors, improves the results of all other alternatives.","['Francisco Charte', 'Inmaculada Romero', 'María Dolores Pérez-Godoy', 'Antonio J.

324,"How can we take advantage of opportunities for experimental parallelization in exploration-exploitation tradeoffs? In many experimental scenarios, it is often desirable to execute experiments simultaneously or in batches, rather than only performing one at a time. Additionally, observations may be both noisy and expensive. We introduce Gaussian Process Batch Upper Confidence Bound (GP-BUCB), an upper confidence bound-based algorithm, which models the reward function as a sample from a Gaussian process and which can select batches of experiments to run in parallel. We prove a general regret bound for GP-BUCB, as well as the surprising result that for some common kernels, the asymptotic average regret can be made independent of the batch size. The GP-BUCB algorithm is also applicable in the related case of a delay between initiation of an experiment and observation of its results, for which the same regret bounds hold. We also introduce Gaussian Process Adaptive Upper Confidence Bound (GP-AUCB), a variant of GP-BUCB which can exploit parallelism in an adaptive manner. We evaluate GP-BUCB and GP-AUCB on several simulated and real data sets. These experiments show that GP-BUCB and GP-AUCB are competitive with state-of-the-art heuristics.","['Thomas Desautels', 'Andreas Krause', 'Joel W.

Experimental results on simulated and real scene point clouds demonstrate that the scale-invariant features of 3D point clouds can be effectively encoded by our method.","['Baowei Lin', 'Fasheng Wang', 'Yi Sun', 'Wen Qu', 'Zheng Chen', 'Shuo Zhang']",5a147284-b529-48ec-a06b-cf28c0c38a9b,0,"['0d68cae7-51b5-41e9-b66a-01254a8022a3', '0df2a457-4e50-46ee-9f08-20392b2d1373', '11310ebe-5624-42cb-9ca8-0ca184524d83', '11741563-8030-496a-b798-70e298dca8ca', '2a885d85-88fb-4e36-ad37-2a20b46f166b', '2b76511c-3799-4ff7-9a94-a784a1a14e83', '2fa2e5ba-11d3-4691-91e1-807b8ef7d8a5', '3755ab1f-0cb8-4077-9613-15ab42eb9d7c', '39c22aea-fe4c-40c0-aa80-cd05a0802b86', '480f199d-3ab7-4364-9b05-e52429bad6e0', '4f205a00-05c1-4331-8552-d40a61fc2124', '5f2afd65-6e52-4645-9c78-27ffd006ac99', '647fe413-c7ab-4c6f-b972-9ee6eeb4c57b', '67aac187-2867-4f67-b706-02da15c39117', '6842d04f-2b92-4298-aee8-92babc53f7c4', '6b72e36c-4d85-4ed1-8442-d294ec842793', '6ed5d5ac-4716-4242-beea-45cbb6b7d3f6', '702b7753-dd37-4f86-b945-734f8de73038', '74b3defc-bbeb-4da5-bd72-6fda3da2a238', '74ff0c05-2d01-47ce-9bfe-0812a33a2682', '7ede52ed-e512-4c84-9355-b68d6f0d6370', '87d0b1c9-bae1-4a60-8daf-71ffeb044dae', '95f9bd5f-6280-4208-bfd4-b937b358105c', '971ffc9b-e10d-4666-b23c-ea05c1d835b8', 'a7a01782-8e14-4dd6-9336-60718abbfc0b', 'a8ba3d87-5a46-41ea-a9f8-22419e7a0003', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'c386f906-f351-44a7-a652-6da3fb4c6dc1', 'ca69ffc6-7780-44ca-aaeb-8bd85d7d0833', 'cb814cf2-c79c-43e8-805b-32f2faff974e', 'd848508a-f298-4640-93b1-5d9370738c77', 'd9169ba6-a6c7-46c4-b46f-43071bbde20d', 'd9ae2f3c-0f6a-4ff3-87f2-0a02300a7db1', 'e374c5e0-f5ca-469b-ac76-0acd258823f3', 'ef7a0c74-9af2-4fae-b882-862cb0013bbf']",Boundary Points based Scale Invariant 3D Point Feature,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017
327,"In this paper we study a cooperative card game called Hanabi from the viewpoint of algorithmic combinatorial game theory. In Hanabi, each card has one among c colors and a number between 1 and n. The aim is to make, for each color, a pile of cards of that color with all increasing numbers from 1 to n. At each time during the game, each player holds h cards in hand. Cards are drawn sequentially from a deck and the players should decide whether to play, discard or store them for future use. One of the features of the game is that the players can see their partners' cards but not their own and information must be shared through hints.#R##N##R##N#We introduce a single-player, perfect-information model and show that the game is intractable even for this simplified version where we forego both the hidden information and the multiplayer aspect of the game, even when the player can only hold two cards in her hand. On the positive side, we show that the decision version of the problem—to decide whether or not numbers from 1 through n can be played for every color—can be solved in (almost) linear time for some restricted cases.","['Jean-Francois Baffier', 'Man-Kwun Chiu', 'Yago Diez', 'Matias Korman', 'Valia Mitsou', 'André van Renssen', 'Marcel Roeloffzen', 'Yushi Uno']",1ffd2959-b4ae-42e5-95c0-15f2d4bc3fdd,0,"['034832d4-ece8-4401-89d1-e46ff90c7509', '2ccf2a9f-0a7b-48de-9a18-855e8a40d9ff', '3ec3fef4-8a2a-40b5-8a09-d0547cc6800d', '41e13783-ae47-4139-928a-e5e319c0cd6a', '460269eb-933a-4c33-b915-8bd65a8d08c8', '530e2d6e-9d95-4489-816a-f81fa1ac8fc7', '555d43f6-885a-4292-8f87-3c62c93ef118', 'a18e4afc-2829-4bcf-8f22-7b99658ba79f', 'b3dcbd8b-f5e3-4100-8fcd-ca1ce2d624c4', 'cc5c4c1f-3623-490f-8c56-b2923d391b49', 'ce4c7da8-4cbc-44a5-89b0-ef48608d344a', 'f1ce4c29-a250-4318-98f1-a32fcf7e8df4']","Hanabi is NP-hard, Even for Cheaters who Look at Their Cards",Theoretical Computer Science,2017
328,"Weighted itemset mining, which is one of the important areas in frequent itemset mining, is an approach for mining meaningful itemsets considering different importance or weights for each item in databases. Because of the merit of the weighted itemset mining, various related works have been studied actively. As one of the methods in the weighted itemset mining, FWI (Frequent Weighted Itemset) mining calculates weights of transactions from weights of items and then finds FWIs based on the transaction weights. However, previous FWI mining methods still have limitations in terms of runtime and memory usage performance. For this reason, in this paper, we propose two algorithms for mining FWIs more efficiently from databases with weights of items. In contrast to the previous approaches storing transaction IDs for mining FWIs, the proposed methods employ new types of prefix tree structures and mine these patterns more efficiently without storing any transaction ID. Through extensive experimental results in this paper, we show that the proposed algorithms outperform state-of-the-art FWI mining algorithms in terms of runtime, memory usage, and scalability.","['Gangin Lee', 'Unil Yun', 'Keun Ho Ryu']",0d00332d-fcdd-4772-813a-f203bccf1b09,50,"['0cbb8a06-52b1-4117-a5af-79ebe41ff0de', '102b4cfe-1333-4b71-b0ce-cdc24f7e8292', '22cb387f-752b-43f5-892c-b4bbe24fdbbb', '26fb14cc-328c-41e3-83f5-e8e517342ef0', '42633d59-7cea-4ef4-89cf-41a289279925', '4530fb04-17e6-4edd-9408-9bbdee26c88b', '4cf93ef2-2288-4dfa-9c31-82259515fb52', '5808608a-c4ab-4beb-bdc5-5d12dcc6ad88', '5a6f9984-aba7-4666-a41e-62c9b71f2d17', '638004c6-a743-4b5c-a13a-7007e5e845d3', '71784f02-c51e-4713-b94f-f0dfd2f7cf98', '79b96b0f-6fcc-45f5-a746-3a32aa1cf72a', '86431a73-9bde-452b-ab03-c03b3f339c6d', '89c95e29-d1c5-4f21-9dbf-deefead2e5a2', '8dfab1bf-29f1-4fcc-b181-ad8e3262ba5c', '9779cf5d-abea-44f7-99c6-8bb3a09bca3c', '9e06cfe7-0178-4b1b-a7a5-5a6c89d6992c', 'a73e794e-fe6f-42df-ad3e-c1aca1937ebc', 'aa3e5849-bd7e-4dd7-be50-857e4045f34f', 'af4d89a6-09f5-4ee9-83a4-a70cf5b98f21', 'b904a61a-508b-471c-a719-e5a40a82cfaf', 'bc1a6a78-c0c8-4a95-9e0d-372e87e30470', 'c86fc247-5d77-4939-9a82-2104dd3efacf', 'c92ef41e-0a4d-4fa1-a616-08074e3d685a', 'd0fc4a4a-fcb0-4b1b-ba73-ce74b7922945', 'e8182b6e-4839-4313-95c6-de44358ce7e9', 'f0f9fc8a-e9db-42af-a995-f1bac9b79a4d']",Mining Frequent Weighted Itemsets without Storing Transaction IDs and Generating Candidates,"International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems",2017

Special emphasis is on the relation among acquisition methods, signal processing, and estimators employed. The description spans from current clinical systems for one-and two-dimensional (1-D and 2-D) velocity estimation to the experimental systems for three-dimensional (3-D) estimation and advanced imaging sequences, which can yield thousands of images or volumes per second with fully quantitative flow estimates. Here, spherical and plane wave emissions are employed to insonify the whole region of interest, and full images are reconstructed after each pulse emission for use in velocity estimation.","['Jørgen Arendt Jensen', 'Carlos Armando Villagomez Hoyos', 'Simon Holbek', 'Kristoffer Lindskov Hansen']",fd7d22b7-c284-4186-859c-82294e198363,0,[],Velocity Estimation in Medical Ultrasound [Life Sciences],IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,2017
331,"Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) involving camera and Scalar Sensor (SS) nodes provide precise information of events occurring in the monitored region by transmitting video packets. In WMSNs, it is necessary to provide coverage of events occurring in the monitored region for longer durations of time. The Camera Sensor (CS) nodes provide the coverage of an event and transmit the video data to the Base Station (BS), when these nodes are actuated by the associated SS nodes on occurring of an event. Therefore, in the existing pieces of work, distributed actuation focuses on the coverage of an event and prolongation of the lifetime of the CS nodes. However, for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, the SS nodes play a vital role. When the data sent by the associated SS nodes in an event area exceed the preconfigured threshold, the CS nodes start sensing the event and send the video data to the BS. Therefore, in addition to the lifetime of the CS nodes, the lifetime of the SS nodes and their data reporting latencies are important aspects for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, while sending both the video and scalar data to the BS. In this work, we propose a topology management-based distributed camera actuation scheme, named TADA, to prolong the lifetime of SS nodes, and decrease the data reporting latency in event area only. The increased lifetime of the SS nodes, in turn, increases the event coverage and packet delivery ratio. To increase the lifetime of the SS nodes in an event area, the SS nodes with the most residual energies are selected as the packet aggregators. In addition, the transmission range of these nodes is decreased, and in-network packet aggregation is performed, while reporting the happening of an event to the associated CS nodes. The aggregator selection mechanism helps in balancing energy consumption of the SS nodes. Similarly, the decrease in transmission range and aggregation mechanism help in decreasing energy consumption of these nodes. The transmission range of the SS nodes is decreased using social network analysis and Coalition Formation Game (CFG). CFG also helps in decreasing the data reporting latency of an event by the SS nodes to their associated CS nodes. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme, TADA, which is based on the distributed topology management protocol named T-Must, achieves high performance in terms of the lifetime of the SS nodes, data reporting latency, coverage ratio of the event, event reporting credibility index, and packet delivery ratio in an environment affected by shadow fading.","['Goutam Mali', 'Sudip Misra']",b6aa8a61-f941-4ba6-a2d2-117f4e5ef695,0,"['075e99f8-d1a9-4597-8e56-288e9d28c0a5', '12cb2814-3fc9-4474-822f-a360d8cf3c9b', '1b5a4dc6-045a-4be9-ae6d-681341c489ed', '1f78d2b7-3c61-45bd-b19a-d6f0e42d507a', '2147352c-6e88-43ff-834d-5b5a4c3ffce6', '23dc4e72-0362-4954-a227-64316fac4516', '3732be0e-69f7-4845-babb-084d2c6ddd3c', '3ab114b1-ddb3-4982-a560-1d818b668872', '40102534-8121-4c0d-afdb-7a475fdb7df7', '437fb418-508e-4f55-85d9-32348fdce464', '45cc7187-56d8-4978-af5a-e7e75a8ce660', '4e8e1ab4-9863-4def-b94d-31184229c57e', '58658af2-814d-451c-ab3d-12ac8c394b11', '5b93fd19-ba56-427e-a831-476ff718ef22', '5cf0d91f-d69b-4ab8-8a3b-ca011b51db10', '6a1d4b23-b614-4397-b109-514ce6ee1d2c', '70d927ae-b598-4e12-9b16-af1191f394ae', '82075a89-c03b-46d6-a765-65d5e5a98890', '863eb791-71a4-4fad-b30e-d97e03acbae8', '8abc06b8-c7e5-44a6-89e2-ca1d461a9764', '8cc9ea80-563f-4e62-bda9-8ff6d71cf6ae', '9409cc46-b906-46d1-87dc-4794963248d6', '955ef36e-af8f-4e4a-97db-836924f718a6', '9801dbce-b140-4b39-80f4-65ff224ee909', 'a189cb9e-dd8f-47f0-b2d0-6f8daae02860', 'a7dc85b6-a7ef-42c4-8268-c28a698bf821', 'ad276218-cda7-4d98-b43a-23c96846f515', 'b1d04bb0-9741-40e2-92d7-f311e5a2c622', 'bd4f35a9-1448-4866-aa09-46b13553306b', 'be3aad31-e74d-4e29-a650-32ed0317634a', 'c8b3fd02-9f10-46d9-befc-f10107f2e8c9', 'c97525c5-1a31-4d22-83b0-44ed18c62643', 'ce642e8a-32f5-4072-9271-c3e527f62d3f', 'd17beebd-c71d-437d-a280-220f16fff7bb', 'd9a1b007-dcb3-4e21-a8c1-940b557c6741', 'dd57fe33-ef53-4ef2-a9de-146f77922042', 'de816c4d-e43d-4901-ba8e-ba5d161cfaf5', 'e85c699b-da00-4977-9700-228fd3dc4a91', 'f1886768-a158-4cef-92b4-48845f46b20e', 'f19ea6ae-5a38-46f6-ba5c-22c927b36e3c', 'f2a71e9d-e448-4876-82e1-f1966ffa198d', 'f734732d-3b9a-4d95-af61-3d137aca3f37', 'fda98290-b780-4d9d-9f33-f1d6cbcdac8f']",Topology Management-Based Distributed Camera Actuation in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks,ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems,2017
332,"Heterogeneous distributed computing systems are the emerging for executing scientific and computationally intensive applications. Cloud computing in this context describes a paradigm to deliver the resource-like computing and storage on-demand basis using pay-per-use model. These resources are managed by data centers and dynamically provisioned to the users based on their availability, demand and quality parameters required to be satisfied. The task scheduling onto the distributed and virtual resources is a main concern which can affect the performance of the system. In the literature, a lot of work has been done by considering cost and makespan as the affecting parameters for scheduling the dependent tasks. Prior work has discussed the various challenges affecting the performance of dependent task scheduling but did not consider storage cost, failure rate-related challenges. This paper accomplishes a review of using meta-heuristics techniques for scheduling tasks in cloud computing. We presented the taxonomy and comparative review on these algorithms.

333,"The penalty incurred by imposing a finite delay constraint in lossless source coding of a memoryless source is investigated. It is well known that for the so-called block-to-variable and variable-to-variable codes, the redundancy decays at best polynomially with the delay, where in this case the delay is identified with the source block length or maximal source phrase length, respectively. In stark contrast, it is shown that for sequential codes (e.g., a delay-limited arithmetic code) the redundancy can be made to decay exponentially with the delay constraint. The corresponding redundancy-delay exponent is shown to be at least as good as the R\'enyi entropy of order 2 of the source, but (for almost all sources) not better than a quantity depending on the minimal source symbol probability and the alphabet size.","['Ofer Shayevitz', 'Eado Meron', 'Meir Feder', 'Ram Zamir']",14760b7e-16c8-471d-8243-cf25a7f09182,3,"['1ab7ccdf-ad76-408a-9baf-6b714db7f984', '2edfb742-d08f-4314-a26e-ead7c9fa5aa7', '328467b2-3680-48aa-bdd1-131ecf7ad959', '44bf608c-5cf7-4d06-8bb0-8578a9e8c82d', '4ba10a0b-412d-42f0-8679-3dfeec0ace24', '5b581c14-442b-45e5-8bb9-dcad654bb069', '60211cff-1586-42dd-9669-ea8cbdd457b2', 'aa1998d9-8814-4e4e-acb0-5bb2dcf0337a', 'b523204f-cbf6-4d26-b0a8-7579b9c4e52d', 'e5c88c6c-ed9b-46d1-8179-85b32dbf628d', 'f53ff479-541d-4be3-a9c9-2dfd03c9429e']",Delay and Redundancy in Lossless Source Coding,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,2014

335,"Automotive radars, along with other sensors such as lidar, (which stands for ""light detection and ranging""), ultrasound, and cameras, form the backbone of self-driving cars and advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs). These technological advancements are enabled by extremely complex systems with a long signal processing path from radars/sensors to the controller. Automotive radar systems are responsible for the detection of objects and obstacles, their position, and speed relative to the vehicle. The development of signal processing techniques along with progress in the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) semiconductor technology plays a key role in automotive radar systems. Various signal processing techniques have been developed to provide better resolution and estimation performance in all measurement dimensions: range, azimuth-elevation angles, and velocity of the targets surrounding the vehicles. This article summarizes various aspects of automotive radar signal processing techniques, including waveform design, possible radar architectures, estimation algorithms, implementation complexity-resolution trade off, and adaptive processing for complex environments, as well as unique problems associated with automotive radars such as pedestrian detection. We believe that this review article will combine the several contributions scattered in the literature to serve as a primary starting point to new researchers and to give a bird's-eye view to the existing research community.","['Sujeet Patole', 'Murat Torlak', 'Dan Wang', 'Murtaza Ali']",57989b96-9d59-4d50-87b8-e57c5d6219ee,0,"['177b93f4-a2a4-47f5-ad64-5254f308c527', '3022558b-e4a1-45c3-9805-5cca569b8da2', '3f94c454-1e15-4781-8102-7f3d82ffa38a', '4c42e3b5-0f33-4813-8c49-6d0c3d5ef3eb', '6af28a8f-4119-4515-ae76-e6ebd01f7048', '74d1bb41-021a-461e-bc10-b1ecdbb3cf45', '7f6c128f-8bc6-48c3-a926-df43377fddb1', '8c4f45e8-4bdc-453d-9ea5-9299319f7a03', 'b0afa6ff-6528-4701-800b-5dc0b5411b0c', 'bf570b4e-6cb8-4fe1-a74d-df3ddb6e25c5', 'cbab1c53-5f60-4adf-8b0c-1ca51171e477', 'ce408d14-0a42-4fef-a6f0-19009728d419']",Automotive Radars: A review of signal processing techniques,IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,2017
336,"Recently, some attentions have been focused on a class of low-density parity-check codes from  affine permutation matrices , called APM-LDPC codes, which have some advantages rather than quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes in the minimum-distance, cycle distribution and error-rate performance. In this letter, first, some novel explicit constructions for exponent matrices of conventional APM-LDPC codes with girths 6, 8, and 10 are investigated, and for each given exponent matrix   $E$    corresponding to an APM-LDPC code with girth   $2g$   ,   $3\leq g\leq 5$  , a lower bound   $Q=Q(E,g)$   is obtained, such that APM-LDPC codes with exponent matrix   $E$   have girth at least   $2g$  , for each (prime) APM size   $m\geq Q$  . Then, regarding to reduce the lower bound, an improved bound   $IQ$   is obtained, which is significantly better than some lower bounds reported for QC-LDPC codes with explicit constructions. Simulation results show that the constructed APM-LDPC codes outperform QC-LDPC codes with the same girth.","['Mohammad Gholami', 'Masoumeh Alinia']",13437706-8081-4e40-8a17-876bc5d6350a,0,"['01cb1b96-89ea-41a1-8a44-a876b7bf9cb1', '06940310-6ea3-4d93-9395-603999939292', '08e42b52-6c1b-4c16-8cf2-9da527b0bf98', '50240b19-8e83-4970-9885-0463b3045a82', '5bb9e51d-2f58-48a0-9fa0-d614e466250e', '5db793e1-a968-444d-afee-5ef1b4461c12', '6c49de74-1010-4271-9f33-322ec36fd1e3', '7a3b4e60-de5d-4537-9a1f-7b8b9bebd118', '7d111338-f6a4-45c6-ba3c-7764321101e6', '8611c7fe-134c-47dd-8ae2-0bf04fe8f224', '9a582561-5d85-4eea-b1b4-a8f12f567dfc', '9e6e7452-36c7-4864-b4d9-9b5a0cd6524c', 'b222df88-70af-4c1e-b178-170fad59c579', 'd4479c06-5af9-4146-a410-2f0942c03399', 'f9335bb4-a9a1-485c-9a93-eac13cc3633d']","Explicit APM-LDPC Codes With Girths 6, 8, and 10",IEEE Signal Processing Letters,2017

339,"This paper investigates the problem of static output feedback control for a class of nonhomogeneous Markovian jump system (NMJS) with asynchronous time delays (ATDs). Since the ATDs subject to uncertain transition probabilities (TPs) are taking into account in a practical phenomenon, new approaches are introduced to deal with the ATDs characterized by nonhomogeneous Markov processes. It is assumed that the communication links are not perfect due to its detrimental effect on the performance of systems. Stochastic variables are presented to characterize the data transmission, which are depending on operation modes and satisfying the Bernoulli distribution. Sets of slack variables are adopted to decouple the product terms between system matrices and Lyapunov matrices. Based on an extended Lyapunov function combined with Finsler inequality approach, the robust static output-feedback controller is designed for the closed-loop NMJS. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the design method.","['Jun Cheng', 'Ju H.

340,"IT-security experts engage in behavior-based malware analysis in order to learn about previously unknown samples of malicious software (malware) or malware families. For this, they need to find and categorize suspicious patterns from large collections of execution traces. Currently available systems do not meet the analysts' needs which are described as: visual access suitable for complex data structures, visual representations appropriate for IT-security experts, provision of workflow-specific interaction techniques, and the ability to externalize knowledge in the form of rules to ease the analysis process and to share with colleagues. To close this gap, we designed and developed KAMAS, a knowledge-assisted visualization system for behavior-based malware analysis. This paper is a design study that describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of the prototype. We report on the validation of KAMAS with expert reviews, a user study with domain experts and focus group meetings with analysts from industry. Additionally, we reflect on the acquired insights of the design study and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the applied visualization methods. An interesting finding is that the arc-diagram was one of the preferred visualization techniques during the design phase but did not provide the expected benefits for finding patterns. In contrast, the seemingly simple looking connection line was described as supportive in finding the link between the rule overview table and the rule detail table which are playing a central role for the analysis in KAMAS.","['Markus Wagner', 'Alexander Rind', 'Niklas Thür', 'Wolfgang Aigner']",b6699300-9f65-41af-84fb-7e36de629f8e,0,"['01e724e7-6863-44b3-902a-5ecc3cb5d03e', '029d9184-9644-42b6-9195-dee3c4d34775', '0dbe0bde-3673-44fb-bf8c-782fc06b1da2', '14fa40c9-82a2-49fa-ae96-66c812a82c5b', '21b24422-734c-458e-816b-e86df012dca2', '220d6313-ce35-48e4-ad97-f87ecfa4cc4c', '2e7e71f6-8011-42ea-9401-96ea8190f714', '361071a6-e5d4-4019-bf95-a64170a7f49c', '41a11dee-5017-478b-a695-0d52e870abb7', '44f22f7e-87ac-430b-98f1-ce34eddb3ed2', '45e5f614-369f-4882-83c2-201180fdd494', '590e4ef2-0bbc-4a6b-8d8f-ceea3fef4094', '5abad7cc-88d9-49d7-9a70-b6204543fb16', '61c34871-9ff1-4ec9-83f5-9883a082883b', '7d21736a-fcdb-43fb-b6a8-097392445f33', '8d6039ed-aa64-4524-9a0d-fbdd12730ca1', '8e34b9ea-e947-41f3-a097-5964b058bdc8', '9a7da388-3ee0-473b-bf14-6eecceeb66ef', 'a22c3176-9a8f-4b4e-849a-806d9b917a07', 'ae6581cd-e184-4ccd-aac2-e275f86d529b', 'b78f30c5-110d-47a5-a2ba-3b135ec9d0bd', 'c6163297-cc2e-45e7-8785-3f0004dbb7cd', 'c716ad76-bdc4-47d1-8586-0d1e334029e9', 'da8a808c-540c-46d7-abbf-77859ba864be', 'e0165c61-c2f5-42fe-8ba1-88b2297e7e61', 'ebb0b177-d7ad-401d-bb03-3d7ea2d3212c', 'f08b534c-b980-4ab7-87ad-576b629053fb', 'f1965fb3-2efe-4340-850a-518030ba962e', 'f5c4fdfe-af84-4bbf-b54a-6a299d83fb1f', 'f7309bb8-5a93-4912-9820-c1f799ee8512', 'f74a97e8-ba84-415d-9f4c-c69b6484d4a4']","A Knowledge-Assisted Visual Malware Analysis System: Design, Validation, and Reflection of KAMAS",Computers & Security,2017

Our model, based on the fuzzy oil drop paradigm, assumes that in a spherical micelle the distribution of hydrophobicity produced by the alignment of polar molecules with the external water environment can be modeled by a 3D Gaussian function. Perturbing this function by changing the values of its sigma parameters leads to a variety of conformations—the model is therefore applicable to globular, cylindrical, and ribbonlike micelles. In the context of protein structures ranging from globular to ribbonlike, our model can explain the emergence of fibrillar forms; particularly amyloids.","['Irena Roterman', 'Mateusz Banach', 'Leszek Konieczny']",3de5efd8-94bb-4671-a698-3e59d73db020,0,"['425c18ff-2b47-47f9-96e3-f582cc44f27f', '52a2d0b5-6533-48c0-b2d8-1c345626fdd7', 'be739d9b-b637-4ae3-b2be-50bb28c63639', 'ccc8a002-3f03-43fc-96c8-d5cf39ef4c4b']",Application of the Fuzzy Oil Drop Model Describes Amyloid as a Ribbonlike Micelle,Entropy,2017
345,"String kernels are typically used to compare genome-scale sequences whose length makes alignment impractical, yet their computation is based on data structures that are either space-inefficient, or incur large slowdowns. We show that a number of exact kernels on pairs of strings of total length n, like the k-mer kernel, the substrings kernels, a number of length-weighted kernels, the minimal absent words kernel, and kernels with Markovian corrections, can all be computed in O(nd) time and in o(n) bits of space in addition to the input, using just a \(\mathtt {rangeDistinct},\) data structure on the Burrows–Wheeler transform of the input strings that takes O(d) time per element in its output. The same bounds hold for a number of measures of compositional complexity based on multiple values of k, like the k-mer profile and the k-th order empirical entropy, and for calibrating the value of k using the data. All such algorithms become O(n) using a suitable implementation of the \(\mathtt {rangeDistinct},\) data structure, and by concatenating them to a suitable BWT construction algorithm, we can compute all the mentioned kernels and complexity measures, directly from the input strings, in O(n) time and in \(O(n\log {\sigma },)\) bits of space in addition to the input, where \(\sigma \) is the size of the alphabet. Using similar data structures, we also show how to build a compact representation of the variable-length Markov chain of a string T of length n, that takes just \(3n\log {\sigma },+o(n\log {\sigma },)\) bits of space, and that can be learnt in randomized O(n) time using \(O(n\log {\sigma },)\) bits of space in addition to the input. Such model can then be used to assign a probability to a query string S of length m in O(m) time and in \(2m+o(m)\) bits of additional space, thus providing an alternative, compositional measure of the similarity between S and T that does not require alignment.","['Djamal Belazzougui', 'Fabio Cunial']",7277bbbc-62cd-43d9-ace1-f5c6c869ffd0,0,"['013f9bc0-5c99-48aa-a024-46a4f3e81244', '03393cf2-0a00-4c3c-acf8-4e6eceb42124', '050b658f-40d9-4e52-ba7b-2cc7cd0cd3cb', '053d6213-0b58-4819-9169-01ecf36528c7', '097758db-1026-4d87-8f06-1305edbc9449', '0d69abdb-71fd-496e-ae5e-56ec975d6cce', '0f09c9c6-fdf9-47d3-838e-96e128533bf7', '0f0d84ea-77a6-4966-897f-7f815238ebfb', '1bf09f14-55d0-4d3d-b83d-566af290839a', '1e544b5d-8fd8-435f-90b6-3a8be9fb8f61', '20ab7725-b421-4289-8606-22eb55df46ea', '23eff7ad-214a-4e4f-bf5a-dd062fb2dcba', '2ac87a51-7a4d-4836-b4d2-de905a566432', '2fbadca0-1be1-4276-aec3-427b4f12eeee', '3c3ce1cf-8c7a-444c-82d8-b428963784e6', '3cea198a-12ef-4efb-bd19-c71547463b18', '402d7c6b-e381-4c31-97f9-fab983057a6a', '4bb39684-b339-4c37-82a5-bc5968a8a36e', '4d5ed7c6-f9ad-425a-a78a-d559768beb95', '4eab542c-26ce-4511-9e7b-6fcbe8ca98bb', '5ab10b6d-1143-48d5-9eee-daef79d90a34', '5b312e29-ce28-4670-929e-59f264dbbeb0', '5f8feb36-c7b6-4d23-a118-00b59f962f95', '64fcf4da-41b2-4469-a70d-2a931061349b', '6e03736b-6dab-4f26-b9ce-c8f3cf6c7534', '72d31cdb-4029-4612-aabb-615e3d5da439', '9903700c-e13f-40f0-ab1f-e4ee34417334', '9b8b1faa-44a0-4b8b-9c21-f9c68b098518', 'ad723d1a-bde4-481e-8754-37fd1c50ce89', 'bb1e46c0-d427-4540-beea-2df15c9dc678', 'cd60409a-2a63-4963-8ba6-484516abf924', 'd158a56c-475a-4230-9543-b67280e3c483', 'd32fc416-fd40-40b9-8109-756a769cfbf4', 'd9bf2ee1-6c8f-44d1-82a5-45cfe5aa7ef4', 'dc60ae9f-f1aa-4a07-895a-50e23b8f4308', 'e78a4285-68df-4dc4-acc6-8180ec225f4f']",A Framework for Space-Efficient String Kernels,Algorithmica,2017
346,"Multichannel automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems commonly separate speech enhancement, including localization, beamforming, and postfiltering, from acoustic modeling. In this paper, we perform multichannel enhancement jointly with acoustic modeling in a deep neural network framework. Inspired by beamforming, which leverages differences in the fine time structure of the signal at different microphones to filter energy arriving from different directions, we explore modeling the raw time-domain waveform directly. We introduce a neural network architecture, which performs multichannel filtering in the first layer of the network, and show that this network learns to be robust to varying target speaker direction of arrival, performing as well as a model that is given oracle knowledge of the true target speaker direction. Next, we show how performance can be improved by  factoring   the first layer to separate the multichannel spatial filtering operation from a single channel filterbank which computes a frequency decomposition. We also introduce an adaptive variant, which updates the spatial filter coefficients at each time frame based on the previous inputs. Finally, we demonstrate that these approaches can be implemented more efficiently in the frequency domain. Overall, we find that such multichannel neural networks give a relative word error rate improvement of more than 5% compared to a traditional beamforming-based multichannel ASR system and more than 10% compared to a single channel waveform model.","['Tara N.

347,"In this work, we present a numerical study of the influence of matrix degrading enzyme (MDE) dynamics and haptotaxis on the development of vessel networks in tumor-induced angiogenesis. Avascular tumors produce growth factors that induce nearby blood vessels to emit sprouts formed by endothelial cells. These capillary sprouts advance toward the tumor by chemotaxis (gradients of growth factor) and haptotaxis (adhesion to the tissue matrix outside blood vessels). The motion of the capillaries in this constrained space is modelled by stochastic processes (Langevin equations, branching and merging of sprouts) coupled to continuum equations for concentrations of involved substances. There is a complementary deterministic description in terms of the density of actively moving tips of vessel sprouts. The latter forms a stable soliton-like wave whose motion is influenced by the different taxis mechanisms. We show the delaying effect of haptotaxis on the advance of the angiogenic vessel network by direct numerical simulations of the stochastic process and by a study of the soliton motion.","['L. L.

348,"The standard smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method suffers from tensile instability. In fluid-dynamics simulations this instability leads to particle clumping and void regions when negative pressure occurs. In solid-dynamics simulations, it results in unphysical structure fragmentation. In this work the transport-velocity formulation of Adami et al. (2013) [14] is generalized for providing a solution of this long-standing problem. Other than imposing a global background pressure, a variable background pressure is used to modify the particle transport velocity and eliminate the tensile instability completely. Furthermore, such a modification is localized by defining a shortened smoothing length. The generalized formulation is suitable for fluid and solid materials with and without free surfaces. The results of extensive numerical tests on both fluid and solid dynamics problems indicate that the new method provides a unified approach for multi-physics SPH simulations.","['C. Zhang', 'X. Y.

349,"The random forests algorithm is a type of classifier with prominent universality, a wide application range, and robustness for avoiding overfitting. But there are still some drawbacks to random forests. Therefore, to improve the performance of random forests, this paper seeks to improve imbalanced data processing, feature selection and parameter optimization. We propose the CURE-SMOTE algorithm for the imbalanced data classification problem. Experiments on imbalanced UCI data reveal that the combination of Clustering Using Representatives (CURE) enhances the original synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithms effectively compared with the classification results on the original data using random sampling, Borderline-SMOTE1, safe-level SMOTE, C-SMOTE, and k-means-SMOTE. Additionally, the hybrid RF (random forests) algorithm has been proposed for feature selection and parameter optimization, which uses the minimum out of bag (OOB) data error as its objective function. Simulation results on binary and higher-dimensional data indicate that the proposed hybrid RF algorithms, hybrid genetic-random forests algorithm, hybrid particle swarm-random forests algorithm and hybrid fish swarm-random forests algorithm can achieve the minimum OOB error and show the best generalization ability. The training set produced from the proposed CURE-SMOTE algorithm is closer to the original data distribution because it contains minimal noise. Thus, better classification results are produced from this feasible and effective algorithm. Moreover, the hybrid algorithm's F-value, G-mean, AUC and OOB scores demonstrate that they surpass the performance of the original RF algorithm. Hence, this hybrid algorithm provides a new way to perform feature selection and parameter optimization.","['Li Ma', 'Suohai Fan']",a49187e1-19ff-4a5f-bfbc-b64390326901,50,"['003493f6-551a-4a9b-b0e7-127c1e62d5a1', '0429c82a-08e5-404d-ba50-f28aac5f3595', '0f115eea-2272-431f-9f21-6d6789b2bbc9', '2076f2d8-e5eb-4f82-98ae-0cc80f69c0fb', '23612d0e-8e8d-413b-a9db-15034eb9896e', '2bd9968a-1e0b-4a11-85a2-19edcf0ee77d', '2f833ce2-731e-4ceb-af7f-c2c289026e3b', '336bc9a1-c92e-4a43-9f02-8f2be5f21c94', '35ad8b21-12f2-4b4e-945e-66161ae42b31', '399fa322-8e8c-4039-9e26-13f8542618a3', '3ae9664a-bf6f-45d2-852f-bba9b47e2b8a', '4e0d2792-5f82-4e13-812c-781172f92e40', '4f6a3669-4523-4c14-bc31-4ac53ea63d3d', '517b80c5-8d01-45fc-8ef4-6b33cf325409', '51f8574d-ee1c-43de-a568-e16ad1c4b348', '5c4bb638-3f91-472c-a054-b5ba1afefa05', '5d723f6b-03b6-440a-8fca-bea2ec7829ec', '64b37c52-2186-4398-ba45-5566f33642ce', '68ceacc0-5e49-48ae-b0b9-4cd09bd1a053', '6c48ae85-3c06-4de7-a51b-8b1b13b638c7', '6ce51714-e2cf-483f-88ea-228fbf355659', '85f6f034-3f13-4189-9caf-5653e288d55e', '8f791e01-1bce-48d4-97cf-90e1b61418bb', '9fd08794-74dc-4f25-b3e8-928f0b6ff611', '9fd5b3a5-5218-4e19-9441-2535440c0be0', 'a6e178c8-d55f-460c-8e5b-c9d5cfb04c20', 'af647f42-0b8d-480b-a36e-c7f351a95473', 'c5b72e8b-a08e-4b70-94db-d7d67568a81a', 'ca734f71-9f50-4db4-9320-24a72e26b93e', 'd1e4e0fb-4d1f-4341-b565-51d880e9bcb8', 'd3d88c7f-6628-44dd-857f-9a69e0f9714c', 'd670b0ab-53aa-4d3a-8e4e-b4a1b0e47ab8', 'd93e2a93-aaa5-4a67-b975-076c95d51ece', 'de2cc18d-9841-4fa0-9d93-c5e1a0e80457', 'e0328c2e-c83a-4c6a-b892-6eb121af104b', 'e5647db2-f367-4050-a0e9-46665ad4e1fd', 'e9dd6298-f3d5-49e0-9b78-c5c42629d2a0', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6', 'ff8c8b8b-452c-439f-a883-14340391f189', 'ff9789d8-031b-4460-a36f-703a1a74bd09']",CURE-SMOTE algorithm and hybrid algorithm for feature selection and parameter optimization based on random forests,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
350,"As a preparatory study for future hyperspectral missions that can measure canopy chemistry, we introduce a novel approach to investigate whether multi-angle Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data can be used to generate a preliminary database with long-term estimates of chlorophyll. MODIS monthly chlorophyll estimates between 2000 and 2015, derived from a fully coupled canopy reflectance model (ProSAIL), were inspected for consistency with eddy covariance fluxes, tower-based hyperspectral images and chlorophyll measurements. MODIS chlorophyll estimates from the inverse model showed strong seasonal variations across two flux-tower sites in central and eastern Amazon. Marked increases in chlorophyll concentrations were observed during the early dry season. Remotely sensed chlorophyll concentrations were correlated to field measurements (r2 = 0.73 and r2 = 0.98) but the data deviated from the 1:1 line with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.355 μg cm−2 (Tapajos tower) to 0.470 μg cm−2 (Manaus tower). The chlorophyll estimates were consistent with flux tower measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP). We also applied ProSAIL to mono-angle hyperspectral observations from a camera installed on a tower to scale modeled chlorophyll pigments to MODIS observations (r2 = 0.73). Chlorophyll pigment concentrations (ChlA+B) were correlated to changes in the amount of young and mature leaf area per month (0.59 ≤ r2 ≤  0.64). Increases in MODIS observed ChlA+B were preceded by increased PAR during the dry season (0.61 ≤ r2 ≤  0.62) and followed by changes in net carbon uptake. We conclude that, at these two sites, changes in LAI, coupled with changes in leaf chlorophyll, are comparable with seasonality of plant productivity. Our results allowed the preliminary development of a 15-year time series of chlorophyll estimates over the Amazon to support canopy chemistry studies using future hyperspectral sensors.","['Thomas Hilker', 'Lênio Soares Galvão', 'Luiz E.

351,"State estimation plays a critical role in self-detection and control of the smart grid. Data integrity attacks (also known as false data injection attacks) have shown significant potential in undermining the state estimation of power systems, and corresponding countermeasures have drawn increased scholarly interest. Nonetheless, leveraging optimal phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement to defend against these attacks, while simultaneously ensuring the system observability, has yet to be addressed without incurring significant overhead. In this paper, we enhance the least-effort attack model, which computes the minimum number of sensors that must be compromised to manipulate a given number of states, and develop an effective greedy algorithm for optimal PMU placement to defend against data integrity attacks. Regarding the least-effort attack model, we prove the existence of smallest set of sensors to compromise and propose a feasible reduced row echelon form (RRE)-based method to efficiently compute the optimal attack vector. Based on the IEEE standard systems, we validate the efficiency of the RRE algorithm, in terms of a low computation complexity. Regarding the defense strategy, we propose an effective PMU-based greedy algorithm, which cannot only defend against data integrity attacks, but also ensure the system observability with low overhead. The experimental results obtained based on various IEEE standard systems show the effectiveness of the proposed defense scheme against data integrity attacks.","['Qingyu Yang', 'Dou An', 'Rui Min', 'Wei Yu', 'Xinyu Yang', 'Wei Zhao']",e12dcd0a-8670-474c-abf4-4383bbe13bcc,0,"['0b0b1e1f-3e55-4e1b-92e8-d974bcd02b58', '1034243a-6a3a-462d-a641-f9c8e9ddbc8c', '13f05621-3163-4074-a9c4-792a2ccf7d69', '1f455135-afdf-44cc-bec3-5ca47346bbe1', '1f74ec66-6518-44ca-89ec-f682272d1bf6', '21fd236f-92ff-4d80-a6f0-4be3c3a56d45', '23a2f4bc-d40c-4377-9afe-1de007b7cd60', '29cfbce2-37c6-4f9c-b68f-b1dc92975030', '2d47202c-43fd-42c5-9c85-8cf90d923ada', '32cb3a1e-b146-43ca-9a1c-1a6e898170f7', '33ce411f-2232-4ca7-a6d9-867c6640d570', '47d92bb5-3e38-4f40-bce0-3b4902da3c4a', '4b4262d7-5746-4503-8a98-54c2da55efae', '5080de0a-83fe-4e57-84ae-c8ac7f6d7e2e', '580d4385-e09d-4022-bf89-ca0ae996eb1e', '5b629780-f895-47bd-aac3-ba77fd339f7c', '61af5670-c359-4d36-882a-a556f57d13ef', '68ad086a-7ecd-41c9-a400-4ebe174c3909', '6f78779b-c5b3-4daf-baba-10e87c0efd2a', '71d5850c-f2c6-4666-acc6-6536f81b9401', 'a983bf50-3936-4850-abc0-c096c820fc76', 'abe0b155-da58-4071-812e-971c4738e62e', 'b49e9731-5f0f-4f4c-92d5-5fd34957d3dc', 'd93321d4-536c-4a62-aacf-81b621c21803', 'f3425328-7586-4969-a9a7-d0df5328eb61', 'fdfe5560-9082-4194-8eb6-088c1f8c68c2']",On Optimal PMU Placement-Based Defense Against Data Integrity Attacks in Smart Grid,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2017

Rooted in postadoption behavior and commitment theory, our study offers three distinct mechanisms that regulate how one’s experience at an SNS translates into commitment that leads to prosocial behavior. In particular, satisfaction, affective commitment, and active participation substantiate a dedication-based mechanism; past investments, continuance commitment, and resulting inattention to alternatives form a constraint-based mechanism; and social support, normative commitment and users’ intentions to moderate comments are a third, obligation-based mechanism.

353,"The brain’s self-monitoring of activities, including internal activities – a functionality that we refer to as awareness – has been suggested as a key element of consciousness. Here we investigate whether the presence of an inner-eye-like process (monitor) that supervises the activities of a number of subsystems (operative agents) engaged in the solution of a problem can improve the problem-solving efficiency of the system. The problem is to find the global maximum of a NK fitness landscape and the performance is measured by the time required to find that maximum. The operative agents explore blindly the fitness landscape and the monitor provides them with feedback on the quality (fitness) of the proposed solutions. This feedback is then used by the operative agents to bias their searches towards the fittest regions of the landscape. We find that a weak feedback between the monitor and the operative agents improves the performance of the system, regardless of the difficulty of the problem, which is gauged by the number of local maxima in the landscape. For easy problems (i.e., landscapes without local maxima), the performance improves monotonically as the feedback strength increases, but for difficult problems, there is an optimal value of the feedback strength beyond which the system performance degrades very rapidly.",['José F.

354,"We explore the use of Gaussian process emulators (GPE) in the numerical simulation of   CO 2        CO    2          injection into a deep heterogeneous aquifer. The model domain is a two-dimensional, log-normally distributed stochastic permeability field. We first estimate the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the   CO 2        CO    2          breakthrough time and the total   CO 2        CO    2          mass using a computationally expensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We then show that we can accurately reproduce these CDF estimates with a GPE, using only a small fraction of the computational cost required by traditional MC simulation. In order to build a GPE that can predict the simulator output from a permeability field consisting of 1000 s of values, we use a truncated Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion of the permeability field, which enables the application of the Bayesian functional regression approach. We perform a cross-validation exercise to give an insight of the optimization of the experiment design for selected scenarios: we find that it is sufficient to use 100 s values for the size of training set and that it is adequate to use as few as 15 K-L components. Our work demonstrates that GPE with truncated K-L expansion can be effectively applied to uncertainty analysis associated with modeling of multiphase flow and transport processes in heterogeneous media.","['Liang Tian', 'Richard D.

A set of channel state process with partly unknown transition probabilities is introduced to model time-varying fading channels, which characterises various configurations in physical communication environment and/or different channel fading amplitudes. Partly unknown Markov fading channels are more general than completely known Markov fading channels. Sufficient condition for mean square quadratic (MSQ) stabilisation over partly unknown Markov fading channels is given in the paper. Besides, necessary and sufficient conditions for MSQ stabilisation in two special cases, i.e. completely known Markov fading channels and independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) fading channels, are also given, respectively. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.","['Wei Chen', 'Yuanyuan Zou', 'Nan Xiao', 'Jun Song', 'Yugang Niu']",be79678a-26ee-449e-b807-393b1638368d,0,"['03603d4e-7a11-48fd-8188-eed7a72a5c1b', '223edc15-f2f7-4796-8b91-9fab63eda279', '3a7f7068-a4e7-449b-9c37-9746ebd2f69c', '562b3520-7be1-4273-be5c-58556b2f31b2', '596f25dc-0708-4a05-82b6-7ac27eb1f8e2', '714fe374-aaca-4d7f-b6ac-0f817de07b1f', '7587d38c-c9ce-4559-a683-7e9ee62b91e2', '9ee8a77b-3295-4d04-bc63-fa4351ed614d', 'b38733c7-57ea-4b90-a0ed-f9f8a0239b68', 'b473272e-d873-4931-9132-262fa426e383', 'bb40e790-41be-4758-909e-ecef9f3ecad2', 'bdceee14-a414-421d-bcb6-55ca86f27de7', 'c22072b9-c4cd-45de-84d8-02cc9061bef5', 'c658c150-7ca3-4dca-95f7-f5de4cfb33ae', 'e3fd281f-5611-4597-8216-fb67da209464', 'e5b64820-cd82-4d79-ab19-9169eaa96777', 'f808a725-5063-44c9-869c-f6db47db2858']",Quantised feedback stabilisation of LTI systems over partly unknown Markov fading channels,International Journal of Systems Science,2017
356,"The performance of Volt/VAr optimization has been significantly improved due to the integration of measurement data obtained from the advanced metering infrastructure of a smart grid. However, most of the existing works lack: 1) realistic unbalanced multi-phase distribution system modeling; 2) scalability of the Volt/VAr algorithm for larger test system; and 3) ability to handle gross errors and noise in data processing. In this paper, we consider realistic distribution system models that include unbalanced loadings and multi-phased feeders and the presence of gross errors such as communication errors and device malfunction, as well as random noise.

358,"Social media enable organizations in crisis to communicate regularly about crisis events to the public. Furthermore, consumers have the opportunity to respond to the organization’s posts about the crisis. Little is known, however, about how organizations should deal with online consumer comments to such posts. Therefore, the current study examines how organizations in crisis best deal with positive and negative consumer comments to an organizational crisis-related post. A 2 (tone of voice organizational response: personalized versus corporate) x 2 (consumer comment valence: positive versus negative) between-subjects experimental design (N = 264) was used to examine if a personalized organizational response to consumer comments is advisable to protect organizational reputation, and whether or not the desirability of it depends on the valence of these comments. Results show that a personalized organizational response to a consumer comment on an organizational crisis message post beneficially affects organizational reputation through higher perceptions of conversational human voice (CHV) and sequentially lower consumer skepticism. However, the effect of response personalization is not unanimously positive. When consumer comments are positive, a personalized organizational response damages organizational reputation due to increased consumer skepticism. The positive effect of a personalized response on organizational reputation through CHV disappeared when responding to positive consumer comments. When consumer reactions are negative, however, personalizing the organizational response is beneficial for organizational reputation due to increased perceptions of CHV.","['Hannelore Crijns', 'Veroline Cauberghe', 'Liselot Hudders', 'An-Sofie Claeys']",8eddfdb1-096a-4629-84e4-f3518287430a,0,"['017bb4f7-f80f-45e2-9307-96d61444bda2', '3b612a7f-43fe-461e-a084-0495438afbee', '41ffef84-c19f-4b42-898c-726e716e2aa1', '5a33af0d-1101-45fd-8b6b-19347428bbe6', '64d6afcb-09fc-4342-b14c-7019554701b6', '705ca10a-286b-4ba4-9704-01ccae2e0f22', '83ba70f7-0c2a-4992-b292-50d9147335d6', '8435d4e8-7c3c-4332-aff5-a4554e9545b7', '896ce441-6953-4eb9-a061-afa4c6ea0282', '9afb2e2a-62bf-4071-8762-46905f517766', 'c8f78dd5-d658-402f-a483-36c3475a4a4e', 'c9f90c5d-5b16-4231-b9c9-17604090c7b9', 'e4c00ad5-521c-474f-8b88-a1b0bffe4053', 'eab65ca3-357d-4f49-9cff-62c80e3f0929', 'f8385a01-99fd-4b68-ac9e-575a8cda5139', 'fc96cf54-6ce1-4445-b602-dfb2589e6572']",How to deal with online consumer comments during a crisis?

359,"Abstract  Background  For the growing proportion of elders globally, aging-related illnesses are primary causes of morbidity causing reliance on family members for support in the community. Family caregivers experience poorer physical and mental health than their non-caregiving counterparts. Web-based interventions can provide accessible support to family caregivers to offset declines in their health and well-being. Existing reviews focused on web-based interventions for caregivers have been limited to single illness populations and have mostly focused on the efficacy of the interventions. We therefore have limited insight into how web-based interventions for family caregiver have been developed, implemented and evaluated across aging-related illness.  Objectives  To describe: a) theoretical underpinnings of the literature; b) development, content and delivery of web-based interventions; c) caregiver usage of web-based interventions; d) caregiver experience with web-based interventions and e) impact of web-based interventions on caregivers' health outcomes.  Methods  We followed Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews which entails setting research questions, selecting relevant studies, charting the data and synthesizing the results in a report.  Results  Fifty-three publications representing 32 unique web-based interventions were included. Over half of the interventions were targeted at dementia caregivers, with the rest targeting caregivers to the stroke, cancer, diabetes and general frailty populations. Studies used theory across the intervention trajectory. Interventions aimed to improve a range of health outcomes for caregivers through static and interactive delivery methods Caregivers were satisfied with the usability and accessibility of the websites but usage was generally low and declined over time. Depression and caregiver burden were the most common outcomes evaluated. The interventions ranged in their impact on health and social outcomes but reductions in perception of caregiver burden were consistently observed.  Conclusions  Caregivers value interactive interventions that are tailored to their unique needs and the illness context. However, usage of the interventions was sporadic and declined over time, indicating that future interventions should address stage-specific needs across the caregiving trajectory. A systematic review has the potential to be conducted given the consistency in caregiver burden and depression as outcomes.","['Marina Bastawrous Wasilewski', 'Jennifer Stinson', 'Jill I.

The proposed technique builds on the recently proposed contract design methodology by Kerkhove and Vanhoucke (Omega, 2015). Specifically, a novel multi-objective scatter search heuristic is proposed and implemented using parallelisation. Both single- and multi-population implementations of this heuristic are compared to the original full-factorial approach as well as commercial optimisation software. The results of the computational experiments indicate that the single-population parallel scatter search procedure significantly outperforms the other solution strategies in terms of both speed and solution quality.","['Louis-Philippe Kerkhove', 'Mario Vanhoucke']",db0a01a5-5679-45ec-8660-69365b392300,0,"['06e6c464-5b7e-4595-b61d-81b00d97fed9', '1892f85e-25bc-4f42-b028-569f299e3aca', '1ac6d8a8-9817-401a-bb52-2fafaee2856b', '1dde4432-aa8e-4cd2-88ce-fa4e0c292232', '2d433ff7-1cae-45f3-af89-fbcda8064207', '4443ce8d-df57-4099-bdd8-15cc0cc6f9a8', '6a7dead2-b8f0-42bd-813a-a9039dded14f', '6bd7ac08-fcd7-409c-9518-be3b0ba25ac4', '6e21ddb1-4039-4ba2-9b64-a641aeb9039e', '914914c9-9a60-409f-93c2-bc5a2d527cdc', 'ac2eb13e-ad7a-42cc-a6b5-33ff7ed13404', 'd267038f-17a2-4c3b-a6ca-740bf2348447', 'da203057-3a15-416a-88c8-c16f88df561c', 'f6d08469-c14d-48a8-af25-73f66b70bdbc', 'fae230b4-8ee6-45eb-ba9f-9861be9c1cd5']",A parallel multi-objective scatter search for optimising incentive contract design in projects,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
361,"Impact of mineralogical heterogeneity of rocks in reactive modelling is investigated by applying a pore scale model based on the Lattice Boltzmann and Finite Volume Methods. Mass transport, chemical reaction and solid structure modification are included in the model. A two-dimensional mineral map of a sandstone rock is acquired using the imaging technique of QEMSCAN SEM with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The mineralogical heterogeneity is explored by conducting multi-mineral reaction simulations on images containing various minerals. The results are then compared with the prediction of single mineral dissolution modelling. Dissolution patterns and permeability variations of multi-mineral and single mineral reactions are presented. The errors of single mineral reaction modelling are also estimated. Numerical results show that mineralogical heterogeneity can cause significant errors in permeability prediction, if a uniform mineral distribution is assumed. The errors are smaller in high Peclet regimes than in low Peclet regimes in this sample.","['Min Liu', 'Mehdi Shabaninejad', 'Peyman Mostaghimi']",f30d2664-519e-4149-b2ff-5d78cf6b3c97,50,"['a8d2363c-08d2-40e8-aca1-ff1964407d21', 'c26420d6-dd8a-4338-87d4-fd628711a94b', 'c6148ebf-dad1-43cc-8570-66fdd72e722a']",Impact of mineralogical heterogeneity on reactive transport modelling,Computers & Geosciences,2017
362,"The predicted increase in mobile data traffic and in the number of mobile users poses challenges for network operators. Future mobile networks should support traffic volumes of several orders of magnitude larger than today. This may create situations in which the transmission capacity of the network is inadequate for the traffic demand. Intelligent and robust network management methods are thus needed to handle the upcoming changes. Because quite often the bottleneck lies in the wireless part of the network, it is essential to have methods in place to select appropriate wireless access points for the users or their applications. This can be performed either by a central entity or in a distributed manner in which the intelligence is placed in the user equipment or hybrid combinations of those. The selection criteria may vary from selfish optimization of a single user's quality of experience to global network load balancing and class-wise prioritization. This work explores the wireless access selection scheme from a system perspective in scenarios where users of different subscription classes are using progressive video streaming. Evaluation is carried out between a Q-learning based user-centric algorithm, a user class aware network-centric algorithm and a setting without handovers. Simulation results show that both user-centric and network-centric algorithms are able to improve the network performance and the quality of experience of the users. The gains of the network-centric algorithm are more evident during high congestion. In a lightly congested network, the distributed selfish optimization is also qualitatively a good solution for gold users.

363,"The development of a DC magnetic field sensor based on a magnetoelectric (ME) PVDF/Metglas composite is reported. The ME sensing composite has an electromechanical resonance frequency close to 25.4 kHz, a linear response (r 2   = 0.997) in the 0–2 Oe DC magnetic field range, and a maximum output voltage of 112 mV (ME voltage coefficient α 33  of a30 V·cm −1 ·Oe −1 ). By incorporating a charge amplifier, an AC-RMS converter and a microcontroller with an on-chip analog-to-digital converter, the ME voltage response is not distorted, the linearity is maintained, and the ME output voltage increases to 3.3 V (α 33effective  = 1000 V·cm −1 ·Oe −1 ). The sensing device, including the readout electronics, has a maximum drift of 0.12 Oe with an average total drift of 0.04 Oe, with a sensitivity of 1.5 V·Oe −1  (15 kV·T −1 ), and a 70 nT resolution. This feature is for the first time reported on a polymer-based ME device and compares favourably with a reference Hall sensor that showed a maximum drift of 0.07 Oe and an average error of 0.16 Oe, 5 V·T  −1  sensitivity, and 2 μT resolution. Such properties allied to the accurate measurement of the DC magnetic field (H DC ) in the 0–2 Oe range make this polymer-based device very attractive for applications, such as Earth magnetic field sensing, digital compasses, navigation, and magnetic field anomaly detectors, among others.","['S.

364,"Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a popular machine learning method which can flexibly simulate the relationships of real-world classification applications. When facing problems (i.e., data sets) with a smaller number of samples (i.e., instances), ELM may often result in the overfitting trouble. In this paper, we propose a new Instance Cloned Extreme Learning Machine (IC-ELM for short) which can handle numerous different classification problems. IC-ELM uses an instance cloning method to balance the input data’s distribution and extend the training data set, which alleviates the overfitting issue and enhances the testing classification accuracy. Experiments and comparisons on 20 UCI data sets, and validations on image and text classification applications, demonstrate that IC-ELM is able to achieve superior results compared to the original ELM algorithm and its variants, as well as several other classical machine learning algorithms.","['Yongshan Zhang', 'Jia Wu', 'Chuan Zhou', 'Zhihua Cai']",4cf8899b-5894-4b47-831c-902fd454d156,0,"['080ef167-ea62-4951-9511-dfb4155085f7', '0902f583-7a74-42ae-9770-0746e8deb7d0', '0ea6aaee-68a2-4a89-965a-da9796d73547', '144feae6-017f-4ad8-8f16-43d1578255aa', '19d8e565-399d-47a8-bd30-8ff4fe857892', '1b3a4414-f0e6-440e-b9de-892480c1a9b9', '216428e9-b6c3-42b9-9ed4-76d4982effbc', '31233753-4a8b-4375-941c-5fd3121feb0f', '326a26d2-e5ab-434b-92cb-069e9b894ae2', '33abc1fc-50ea-4837-a4a0-65c1d4c0e0b7', '35356892-1a2c-424e-8794-1c0e3b6c3a8f', '3558d356-d555-4b9d-ae66-88da35ade18b', '381f8621-91d3-4798-b4ff-676a3bd0d343', '3bfe9b49-fa7a-4cd2-b159-e5ecfb59dd80', '3fab9a94-0abc-4aef-b66a-71f00faeeea8', '445f77a7-198d-4005-a9c7-dd9fccbb6faf', '4c43ee71-e19b-478d-9aec-c2c8b77f71f9', '4caf2be7-1436-4843-b6a0-4b45981c0b4d', '583c3428-ab4e-49a3-9809-0023e48db20b', '58440269-3d97-4346-a92e-4af30eeb47d6', '58986749-f7f2-4c0c-a0f8-37180df48756', '5b9999c4-db5c-44b5-bd60-a0f2407e95d7', '5f645175-f3ea-4430-8721-17d20eac3b89', '65d05558-93e3-4798-aa6d-821d5fb12ed8', '6fbe6253-9183-48a3-be42-986ce1f8b095', '7964a019-c3ce-4055-b974-41266d1f78ed', '7dbaf8ea-c035-476c-8338-8c9adbeab019', '7dd05853-d0b9-4cec-b5cb-204ceac86a80', '84d47128-58d0-4187-aa44-389fde7d5c83', '8ae7ad12-abf9-4850-9d1d-58867b6b3b4f', '8e692473-24a8-435d-94fc-fd75d3ea8874', '8ef1a005-64bd-46a6-9920-dbf3c8d81dd1', '9110d0c7-0255-4389-818e-fb62dfd7c26c', '957c54d7-cecb-4ece-8e6e-1779237fb433', '99dfb508-10c1-4e15-bb7c-daa4b7fe1e07', '9c53f5e2-e01c-4f9e-b032-c97219e81068', 'a649f6bc-6c1d-4256-9601-504b897c8f44', 'afba766c-accc-4401-887b-28d570de2831', 'bd384b5e-e340-412e-8372-b82b26853df9', 'c02af92b-cfa2-49bd-8df4-1dfa701e2286', 'c4d30d07-f685-4b03-b864-29866f1b6643', 'c7e0d596-9edb-42cc-a550-1832802bf683', 'ceec8957-697e-43cc-9e4b-c5b4ddc7adf7', 'd36ebf14-bef0-48b1-8ef8-a3ef8f1b5583', 'df1ecfa5-764f-4171-ba29-8738a208540a', 'e7fc222c-f467-417c-9a25-2d5bab9e4bc9', 'e84bca75-9d7e-43a9-aa2b-211951ea1ce9', 'ee64f486-4068-43d4-bc90-4fdd62aef2f1', 'ef9c7d4f-9cee-42ad-9eb7-3622f0e335a3', 'f3b4d931-92fc-4d03-acaa-347a2f189c2b', 'f83e6d25-aa57-494f-a9fe-272878b73ec9', 'fd9d895c-b74b-4a60-98a8-dd945d1f6247']",Instance cloned extreme learning machine,Pattern Recognition,2017
365,"This paper is concerned with the exponential synchronization of Lur’e type complex dynamical networks with uncertain coupling strength. A novel pinning impulsive controller is designed to achieve synchronization, in which, only selection of nodes are chosen to control instead of the whole network. In addition, the proposed control scheme is digital and it can lead to low installation cost and less time. In order to realize synchronization of Lur’e type complex dynamical networks, crucial delay-dependent stability conditions are derived by utilizing Lyapunov functional together with information of the time-varying delay and convex combination technique. The resulting stability conditions are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and by solving the obtained LMIs, desired impulsive control gain matrices are calculated, which are capable to guarantee the exponential stability of error system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulations.","['R. Rakkiyappan', 'G. Velmurugan', 'J. Nicholas George', 'R.

366,"Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become an important tool for studying micro- or nano-scale dynamics and the statistical properties of fluids and solids. In MD simulations, there are mainly two approaches: equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD and NEMD). In this paper, a new energy conversion based correction (ECBC) method for MD is developed. Unlike the traditional systematic correction based on macroscopic parameters, the ECBC method is developed strictly based on the physical interaction processes between the pair of molecules or atoms. The developed ECBC method can apply to EMD and NEMD directly. While using MD with this method, the difference between the EMD and NEMD is eliminated, and no macroscopic parameters such as external imposed potentials or coefficients are needed. With this method, many limits of using MD are lifted. The application scope of MD is greatly extended.","['Hanhui Jin', 'Ningning Liu', 'Xiaoke Ku', 'Jianren Fan']",38028b50-7f06-479f-bcfa-4568824af145,0,[],A novel energy conversion based method for velocity correction in molecular dynamics simulations,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
367,"Nonlinear fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems on unstructured meshes in 3D appear in many applications in science and engineering, such as vibration analysis of aircrafts and patient-specific diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In this work, we develop a highly scalable, parallel algorithmic and software framework for FSI problems consisting of a nonlinear fluid system and a nonlinear solid system, that are coupled monolithically. The FSI system is discretized by a stabilized finite element method in space and a fully implicit backward difference scheme in time. To solve the large, sparse system of nonlinear algebraic equations at each time step, we propose an inexact Newton–Krylov method together with a multilevel, smoothed Schwarz preconditioner with isogeometric coarse meshes generated by a geometry preserving coarsening algorithm. Here “geometry” includes the boundary of the computational domain and the wet interface between the fluid and the solid. We show numerically that the proposed algorithm and implementation are highly scalable in terms of the number of linear and nonlinear iterations and the total compute time on a supercomputer with more than 10,000 processor cores for several problems with hundreds of millions of unknowns.","['Fande Kong', 'Xiao-Chuan Cai']",6b1b0ad6-9510-431c-b83c-b8394be8d4ad,0,"['0202700d-73a2-46c1-97c6-83d8b1d3900d', '0969ce17-4cdb-477f-80a1-ba6041b3211c', '27a26782-09af-4440-b497-f1b4329de4dd', '2c51d7aa-8f3d-4881-a8b4-aeeba4bc20a7', '4070507f-1c9a-4bed-a1ff-ebb6899e4ad4', '4c3cd216-28d6-43bc-b7e5-d0dadab032e2', '638558f1-31d7-4857-9f49-e8d9edc129f2', 'a4806847-a0ff-4dff-bd65-720237ac541d', 'dfc990f5-f9f3-42bc-b351-46ac99f3359d', 'dfe7b389-2301-4e95-98ee-d3a0488f4f71', 'e0b4925b-cb20-4389-8826-fb1b0972e296', 'e9af615e-eb4f-4059-a80c-d1961fa99fa9', 'e9beb4f0-a634-4432-a430-95a23589468d', 'fd96140c-57f0-433e-9170-51d3316a0596']",A scalable nonlinear fluid–structure interaction solver based on a Schwarz preconditioner with isogeometric unstructured coarse spaces in 3D,Journal of Computational Physics,2017

370,"If the influence diagram (ID) depicting a Bayesian game is common knowledge to its players then additional assumptions may allow the players to make use of its embodied irrelevance statements. They can then use these to discover a simpler game which still embodies both their optimal decision policies. However the impact of this result has been rather limited because many common Bayesian games do not exhibit sufficient symmetry to be fully and efficiently represented by an ID. The tree-based chain event graph (CEG) has been developed specifically for such asymmetric problems. By using these graphs rational players can make analogous deductions, assuming the topology of the CEG as common knowledge. In this paper we describe these powerful new techniques and illustrate them through an example modelling a game played between a government department and the provider of a website designed to radicalise vulnerable people.","['Peter A.

372,"Graph-based variational methods have recently shown to be highly competitive for various classification problems of high-dimensional data, but are inherently difficult to handle from an optimization perspective. This paper proposes a convex relaxation for a certain set of graph-based multiclass data segmentation models involving a graph total variation term, region homogeneity terms, supervised information and certain constraints or penalty terms acting on the class sizes. Particular applications include semi-supervised classification of high-dimensional data and unsupervised segmentation of unstructured 3D point clouds. Theoretical analysis shows that the convex relaxation closely approximates the original NP-hard problems, and these observations are also confirmed experimentally. An efficient duality-based algorithm is developed that handles all constraints on the labeling function implicitly. Experiments on semi-supervised classification indicate consistently higher accuracies than related non-convex approaches and considerably so when the training data are not uniformly distributed among the data set. The accuracies are also highly competitive against a wide range of other established methods on three benchmark data sets. Experiments on 3D point clouds acquire by a LaDAR in outdoor scenes and demonstrate that the scenes can accurately be segmented into object classes such as vegetation, the ground plane and human-made structures.","['Egil Bae', 'Ekaterina Merkurjev']",e51353ff-9cda-46fb-9984-4cd9b7c80a1c,0,"['01d5bd72-becb-4055-8874-f7c07244b763', '0dacebc0-dc0e-4863-8a52-e0917deb1652', '1317365d-c46d-4c09-8261-9d07404e4908', '16bda7ee-66ee-4798-942c-cf8cb722b202', '18d03582-d2f0-4900-ad6d-4d4b6985fc80', '1accc3cd-88ce-4b30-b933-c4de87a11131', '1b806dc6-7d06-48c4-b8a9-16111d135559', '1c63e1d5-b963-455b-829d-e4f3eb63a36a', '1d0a0a4e-2992-4f52-9086-93b0b717fb56', '3549c862-c615-4f80-ac53-f562d3e2b846', '3a8fbc53-3805-4e6f-9f45-6881b640eb5e', '3fee36c9-e952-4269-913d-26835febb3f4', '431f2e4a-e31d-43a3-888a-196d8d654092', '435e9dab-6ef2-4061-a120-b262feec4ac8', '443fb8d3-09ba-45a2-98a6-597799c3e63c', '4649a87d-fc69-40dd-aa1f-5a38b59af0db', '471e3583-49c4-41e4-b140-f5f88c8ae1a3', '4cb12e7e-6ef7-4b6f-a7c0-9bd9984c5da6', '51046eb5-4f03-4337-b76b-14509751fa63', '539900a9-4ba1-4242-9c71-3dfc15699445', '54f4a41e-1171-4199-9272-edbb07ee3cae', '57c06dd7-c979-4e72-9c64-901c13743e93', '5c5af32c-b239-4f94-8a6f-95221b664e1e', '5e4eb9f0-2864-41ed-a822-cd3caa9783e2', '688f7783-c2d5-4e5e-b17c-a1934f31d6aa', '6a141419-313a-4533-9eb4-bfe3ed45603d', '6c0f40ca-99ed-461a-ae23-3417a4736749', '6f9b948b-3244-403a-9302-a701e0e87280', '6f9bac76-a0e5-4bdc-9816-cc2881cb55da', '79a8d0a3-eee9-4b61-ace7-87af28e357df', '7f50fa30-1f27-4bf7-b5d1-f0f9b08b2e84', '82be5b3b-185b-4bcf-bea8-652fa8cbec90', '82eb55e6-39a8-4968-8be6-e2bfbb439a40', '8d6ceb51-faeb-4b4e-ae33-3c2890e21d30', '915c6cb7-7f6c-4cd3-828a-7bf93e752408', '9632e5b3-0549-4162-9a7b-21b42c6f444a', '9a4be5b8-b10b-481e-9052-526b478e50fe', '9d6e7a8e-6623-4379-918d-6ba9b6d62395', 'a3354aea-8c97-4c50-8c56-4daebaa56df1', 'a97f608b-8169-4824-b948-aa79fc494bf9', 'aaab1d24-0399-41ec-a5b3-afe38eecc653', 'aaf8346f-383e-4e01-9866-7845149e25d2', 'b0733946-aa20-4f0b-a38e-8523850e9374', 'bd3a3a31-46b2-420d-ba03-057ac8ead4b2', 'bd55a32a-8dab-4551-806c-bce9e4a32c67', 'c44f26b2-6af2-4149-b4e0-12169ec785d9', 'c472bfe1-9ef6-43c6-89b5-a86b22c9f5df', 'cdd6b1f4-012f-4678-be03-b58ef5d7f710', 'd0d5ffb1-3902-4011-8cc1-7411d3c62f73', 'd31ae917-4bb9-4ab7-9287-f7471257118d', 'd41d5d3f-1fc2-4ec6-9d02-70cf4eb5a5e6', 'd424e9e2-4866-45a5-8fc6-5c74164030d8', 'd6104d9a-faaa-4db4-8c4e-748176157ef2', 'dc35c885-cc5a-49fb-b996-fa3aa532af68', 'e2fe3d21-f953-4290-b747-bff0c0e13a8a', 'e8ccebf6-ad52-485b-ba6a-ae301bc3bce0', 'e97d9c05-854e-4bd6-9301-11affc0d103f', 'ede792dd-9a02-41e5-8f31-3722e8e99ec4', 'f1dc702b-13e2-4511-8c24-06a3fd50afe4', 'f33104e1-db59-4434-aa01-7aa9e094eb69', 'f6fc42d9-7413-42ae-832f-d8921c3e367a', 'f7fb9da9-a816-41ad-9c1c-648423c25002', 'f811716a-a8cf-4496-9d58-5ed0e6f693e5', 'fa55a276-4ae1-4620-8adc-76d274a7910d', 'fbafabb2-ae8d-4428-8d94-7373c2fbf14e', 'ffd3e527-c487-4760-bfce-e782dca297d6']",Convex Variational Methods on Graphs for Multiclass Segmentation of High-Dimensional Data and Point Clouds,Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision,2017

We also conduct a one-month user study on several invited volunteers from our laboratory and acquaintance circle to improve our prototype system based on their feedback.","['Xiaoping Fan', 'Yanni Peng', 'Ying Zhao', 'Yong Li', 'Dan Meng', 'Zengsheng Zhong', 'Fangfang Zhou', 'Mingming Lu']",b314ca3c-e28b-4719-9b54-708051823caf,0,"['0e61961a-5c64-401d-a308-40c966deb464', '15aa8e8b-facf-4649-9680-203b8aa0c09d', '1918dbfa-25c4-4c8f-b746-2974c632c73d', '23d72a7d-ea11-45bf-9781-35efd08cac1b', '25094640-781f-4385-8b41-230b678202c1', '2778d427-5572-4d15-aedd-d142512fb194', '2d65a1a4-f83d-41ea-873a-067f66a6a9bf', '5855a126-64c5-4942-a456-024b68022c8f', '658cb61e-2052-4d92-a839-32f2d6c2441d', '6730ebd9-7cc0-459b-a27f-0b37c0a81077', '68174c77-cb47-442b-b77b-9d043b325943', '70cdb785-4002-4813-95e8-7d5a2042608a', '7b9528dd-095c-43d7-aeaf-814668949c17', '85fa4712-d099-4a77-bd89-e01af5b09c61', '936b2aed-937d-4da7-8ac6-95069b9967d9', '9c768953-b554-468e-aafd-6d1e92535cc0', 'a2ae2ae2-9918-4ba9-b55e-185e1e8d3b03', 'a71b6492-0d7d-435d-9e39-8a673785c2e5', 'c18261cd-6a3a-4349-b863-6d67a6508717', 'cdd3b38d-fbe3-4e8c-b574-5faf240491a0', 'ce541720-86cb-4af3-9ae0-adee72029f20', 'd5fdec96-b1a5-4428-bd94-d4b908ca26e2', 'd8565cf5-37df-4c84-b49a-859998a26548', 'e2937290-9be6-4da2-b634-b9e722928f01', 'ebae8415-23dd-4b95-8553-8a76355caf4d']",A personal visual analytics on smartphone usage data,Journal of Visual Languages and Computing,2017
375,"We present a fast computational framework for the inverse medium problem in scattering, i.e. we look at discretization, reconstruction and numerical performance. The Helmholtz equation in two and three dimensions is used as a physical model of scattering including point sources and plane waves as incident fields as well as near and far field measurements. For the reconstruction of the medium, we set up a rapid variational regularization scheme and indicate favorable choices of the various parameters. The underlying paradigm is, roughly speaking, to minimize the discrepancy between the reconstruction and measured data while, at the same time, taking into account various structural a-priori information via suitable penalty terms. In particular, the involved penalty terms are designed to promote information expected in real-world environments. To this end, a combination of sparsity promoting terms, total variation, and physical bounds of the inhomogeneous medium, e.g. positivity constraints, is employed in the regularization penalty. A primal-dual algorithm is used to solve the minimization problem related to the variational regularization. The computational feasibility, performance and efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated for synthetic as well as experimentally measured data.","['Florian Bürgel', 'Kamil S.

376,"Due to the huge amount of involved data and time-consuming process of join operations, the exact-match joins are rarely used for big data. The most common alternative for exact-match joins are similarity joins which find similar pairs of records. Set similarity join (SSJ) is defined as join of very large tables based on similarity of a set of their attributes, which is called join attributes. To operate the similarity join of two large tables based on their join attributes, the similarity of the values of the join attributes is specified using an appropriate similarity function, and then, the values pairs which their similarity is higher than a certain threshold, are selected as candidates for join in case of similarity.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, a parallel set similarity join method is introduced using the MapReduce programming model. The proposed method uses locality sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques to decrease the number of required comparisons for calculating the similarity of the sets. The performance of the proposed method has been compared with the best previous similarity join methods on real and synthetic datasets in terms of time. The experimental results show that the proposed method works faster than the former methods.","['Mohammad Karim Sohrabi', 'Hosseion Azgomi']",75fd4701-5e5a-4db2-ada5-3848de6e9e26,0,"['035dfcbe-e49e-43e3-a5c4-327a1cd1edb3', '0552a6b3-4ee6-40d8-b19f-de447367e654', '074b7940-ec60-4d65-9124-cdd2050f1c85', '07f66304-43e7-4dd1-a913-3d70d659ec65', '087317c8-8789-4f01-ab9f-ffcb308efe5b', '185cdf46-7693-4658-96fc-c2db8b15ca78', '25bb2855-a821-49b8-8f8a-36f25912d844', '3c8826d8-a927-44b4-8033-23f9a266d77a', '544ec760-2720-48a6-98a0-2b1a6db3a47b', '55b25fe9-12b1-40f6-8236-a71a215318c5', '5bad73b6-ce59-40bd-a82a-51750d3aa37d', '5da97c93-5fd3-42de-af51-fe7286dced0a', '656fcf96-607f-4560-b614-230e51cf6e47', '8a4886f3-144e-4fc8-91dd-de1f04a7fd55', '8c3392ea-a762-4c9a-8f0e-88d57a4ccd4f', '8dfd920d-6dce-4057-bb12-d8511e2d5600', '8f8cd2d1-8362-48eb-9860-292a7b5a8842', '96149327-660d-4dc9-80ce-735b10871dd4', 'bc06baad-bfc1-4b97-b448-0cc80da1ff6a', 'c53a5d03-1eaa-442b-a4cf-d2dbe8e00198', 'cf842a24-514d-4fd2-918e-fd7985349579', 'd409342f-c5a7-4543-ae84-32c05b56f20e', 'd48e4d9d-dcc3-44ea-9aaf-bc06a6c6d241', 'e6f41c32-4742-49b6-b685-ef068ccf8b6e', 'ed7fea3e-fa08-442a-8147-668c818d7abb', 'ee9e2ecb-e754-424f-9c19-b9278568c174']",Parallel Set Similarity Join on Big Data Based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing,Science of Computer Programming,2017
377,"Structure-based virtual screening is an in-silico method to screen a target receptor against a virtual molecular library. Applying docking-based screening to large molecular libraries can be computationally expensive, however it constitutes a trivially parallelizable task. Most of the available parallel implementations are based on message passing interface, relying on low failure rate hardware and fast network connection. Google’s MapReduce revolutionized large-scale analysis, enabling the processing of massive datasets on commodity hardware and cloud resources, providing transparent scalability and fault tolerance at the software level. Open source implementations of MapReduce include Apache Hadoop and the more recent Apache Spark. We developed a method to run existing docking-based screening software on distributed cloud resources, utilizing the MapReduce approach. We benchmarked our method, which is implemented in Apache Spark, docking a publicly available target receptor against #N#                    #N#                      #N#                    #N#                    $$\sim $$#N#                    #N#                      #N#                        ∼#N#                      #N#                    #N#                  2.2 M compounds.

378,"We introduce a novel family of adaptive robust channel estimators for highly challenging underwater acoustic (UWA) channels. Since the underwater environment is highly non-stationary and subjected to impulsive noise, we use adaptive filtering techniques based on minimization of a logarithmic cost function, which results in a better trade-off between the convergence rate and the steady state performance of the algorithm. To improve the convergence performance of the conventional first and second order linear estimation methods while mitigating the stability issues related to impulsive noise, we intrinsically combine different norms of the error in the cost function using a logarithmic term. Hence, we achieve a comparable convergence rate to the faster algorithms, while significantly enhancing the stability against impulsive noise in such an adverse communication medium. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis for the tracking and steady-state performances of our proposed methods in the presence of impulsive noise. In our analysis, we not only consider the impulsive noise, but also take into account the frequency and phase offsets commonly experienced in real life experiments. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms through highly realistic experiments performed on accurately simulated underwater acoustic channels.","['Dariush Kari', 'Iman Marivani', 'Farhan Khan', 'Muhammed O.

We employed three implementations of published algorithms interchangeably to obtain “perfect duality” for all of these problems. Perfect duality is taken to mean that a computed solution of an optimization problem achieves two properties: (1) primal and dual feasibility and (2) equality of primal and dual objective function values, all within the accuracy of the machine employed. Perfect duality was introduced by Duffin (Math Program 4:125–143,1973). When primal and dual objective values differ, we say there is a duality gap.","['Dennis L. Bricker', 'Kenneth O.

380,"We study the capacity of Hodgkin–Huxley neuron in a network to change temporarily or permanently their connections and behavior, the so called spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), as a function of their synchronous behavior. We consider STDP of excitatory and inhibitory synapses driven by Hebbian rules. We show that the final state of networks evolved by a STDP depend on the initial network configuration. Specifically, an initial all-to-all topology evolves to a complex topology. Moreover, external perturbations can induce co-existence of clusters, those whose neurons are synchronous and those whose neurons are desynchronous. This work reveals that STDP based on Hebbian rules leads to a change in the direction of the synapses between high and low frequency neurons, and therefore, Hebbian learning can be explained in terms of preferential attachment between these two diverse communities of neurons, those with low-frequency spiking neurons, and those with higher-frequency spiking neurons.","['Rafael R.

381,"The vulnerability of face recognition systems to presentation attacks (also known as direct attacks or spoof attacks) has received a great deal of interest from the biometric community. The rapid evolution of face recognition systems into real-time applications has raised new concerns about their ability to resist presentation attacks, particularly in unattended application scenarios such as automated border control. The goal of a presentation attack is to subvert the face recognition system by presenting a facial biometric artifact. Popular face biometric artifacts include a printed photo, the electronic display of a facial photo, replaying video using an electronic display, and 3D face masks. These have demonstrated a high security risk for state-of-the-art face recognition systems. However, several presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms (also known as countermeasures or antispoofing methods) have been proposed that can automatically detect and mitigate such targeted attacks. The goal of this survey is to present a systematic overview of the existing work on face presentation attack detection that has been carried out. This paper describes the various aspects of face presentation attacks, including different types of face artifacts, state-of-the-art PAD algorithms and an overview of the respective research labs working in this domain, vulnerability assessments and performance evaluation metrics, the outcomes of competitions, the availability of public databases for benchmarking new PAD algorithms in a reproducible manner, and finally a summary of the relevant international standardization in this field. Furthermore, we discuss the open challenges and future work that need to be addressed in this evolving field of biometrics.","['Raghavendra Ramachandra', 'Christoph Busch']",5af2d9fd-7d89-4584-8891-6643aa1a125d,50,"['0d88ea8f-9dc1-4589-a9e6-d138d9787a76', '0eb229c4-b23d-4f12-9c4a-4eb484dcae4e', '199fd268-ed7d-4624-b232-2dd62a8fa3a2', '1ebbe16d-059f-499b-ad66-0ae35c3eda16', '244ac6e7-af4d-4718-b06b-ee7bb6f77ef2', '25df464d-0e61-4ab0-a5a1-50b062072262', '2635647e-b89f-45bd-bd2f-016f9ff5a49f', '26d6be90-2eb6-4296-a33f-db3a406ddf54', '278cde6c-70c5-4a2a-897f-9afc099cfb21', '2aeff73b-d23a-45ef-b3a8-0e905d411a50', '2ec53ed7-ed3f-4ffe-8e2f-24342ba04d96', '3dcd5638-96fa-446f-b922-de7af88b14b5', '43fad7a5-a762-4508-8dfb-25aaf824db5c', '4cbf74da-4328-494f-856b-4516ec0e72b4', '4cc59f5a-a83b-421c-b18f-be978b4aaccf', '4eea7bcb-2ac3-4376-b746-5097e64abf4e', '50532b4b-4b41-4800-8818-1c1eb3a438c1', '50b8d2cd-4a15-411c-af22-ceddafe54495', '5c1ae099-c671-4d64-b685-7c6e09230248', '60513834-7e2d-4c1b-8860-467621a6d649', '6337b18c-bf49-4411-9d4c-42a101e64b68', '692ec770-32ac-45cd-8315-3aff431bbeb8', '6d6bff8f-fd87-4fa8-b7ca-4d0728c2ec92', '719472a3-4f00-4570-bc58-17cdf87085be', '72688fb0-8a95-4f28-a7aa-8b4c7728cf1b', '72ab44e5-a4f5-4168-86ee-b387ad900880', '75dffcce-f314-4549-a8d8-035d19ebdd18', '774da7b0-e7ad-4685-b537-967bd49dd132', '86109e68-c3b0-43b2-8c6c-ae98d62809f1', '9368fc87-a0fa-4055-9792-4c92e479ed29', '96337974-0db2-4712-97cf-053d56d86e84', '963f943f-fc31-41a2-9952-ec883927dbb7', '99ddbf6a-646f-4f57-a85f-b305ea7d6262', '9fd9a77b-00dc-4413-bdaa-1f409930f484', 'a2f65248-bd60-4706-8402-86e695226b3a', 'a4b7bbeb-1a5e-4682-a24e-122efa95ef08', 'a5578061-e311-4e4a-8fd0-83ffd17c2903', 'a6351b2e-d6ab-4f68-8202-98fe99a598e6', 'ac0be3eb-818c-41a5-8328-9df236e1b4e1', 'b0bb3049-334a-4f3e-b86b-16f7d5df7723', 'b9119323-4cfb-47a6-ab45-a5c3d68bbe11', 'ba11accc-31e7-4e19-bd6f-5d2fb902df51', 'bd46e3b1-c9c1-4662-b138-9b63d7ae56ee', 'bdd4a895-853e-49f8-b952-f65274d57d5b', 'c18c7f82-e29b-4eea-bc3c-74d3ad0c9296', 'c2218d27-b91d-40ca-b536-53c6dfe807fd', 'c470c34a-08fa-4074-8d3a-5bb9605de3f0', 'c95efa0e-3696-4249-bb2b-5b978a288035', 'd2d2c72b-b397-4063-baf4-6009e36af99a', 'd4827c29-8043-4379-ab5a-71dc2ff88c20', 'd60e5e19-5ee6-4cae-bbfb-2ea01a6fcb5d', 'e07331c6-a499-4848-aaf3-c093a1e80f66', 'e292fe47-5251-4888-8356-3580ca5f0cbb', 'ebdc8fe4-1cc4-4d38-9d68-2aeef32f50a3', 'f0594806-30f4-4140-86e5-426725c793bb', 'f0b02f1e-ef5d-45e0-9949-8e9ffc209b59', 'f8566e5f-a95c-4cbd-b7ec-944edc8605d0', 'faec2174-a546-41bf-90b3-c02a0a44bb5c', 'fb8e3d19-0e8b-474d-ac30-2f9e486f5c6a', 'fefd5978-1baf-440a-b85a-22b2b6f3a677', 'ff592729-2683-4616-9909-b22e2deee8d5']",Presentation Attack Detection Methods for Face Recognition Systems: A Comprehensive Survey,ACM Computing Surveys,2017

We pick a fixed number of envelope peaks from the current signal in every iteration according to the number of compute nodes and assign them to the compute nodes on average to search the optimal Morlet wavelets in parallel. With the help of parallel computer systems and Message Passing Interface, the parallel algorithm gives full play to the advantages of parallel computing to significantly improve the computation speed of the matching pursuit decomposition and also has good expandability. Besides, searching only one optimal Morlet wavelet by every compute node in every iteration is the most efficient implementation.","['Chuanhui Li', 'Fanchang Zhang']",79e5b856-5b6f-48e5-aef5-c3d20786bf54,0,['bb3c38fa-c2b0-4d4f-8c9d-ca1884343474'],Matching pursuit parallel decomposition of seismic data,Computers & Geosciences,2017

385,"We demonstrate that behavioral probabilities of human decision makers share many common features with quantum probabilities. This does not imply that humans are some quantum objects, but just shows that the mathematics of quantum theory is applicable to the description of human decision making. The applicability of quantum rules for describing decision making is connected with the nontrivial process of making decisions in the case of composite prospects under uncertainty. Such a process involves deliberations of a decision maker when making a choice. In addition to the evaluation of the utilities of considered prospects, real decision makers also appreciate their respective attractiveness. Therefore, human choice is not based solely on the utility of prospects, but includes the necessity of resolving the utility-attraction duality. In order to justify that human consciousness really functions similarly to the rules of quantum theory, we develop an approach defining human behavioral probabilities as the probabilities determined by quantum rules. We show that quantum behavioral probabilities of humans do not merely explain qualitatively how human decisions are made, but they predict quantitative values of the behavioral probabilities. Analyzing a large set of empirical data, we find good quantitative agreement between theoretical predictions and observed experimental data.","['V. I.

While some online communities have used monetary rewards to motivate product review contributions, empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of such rewards remains limited. We examine the possible moderating effect of social connectedness (measured as the number of friends) on publicly offered monetary rewards using field data from an online review community. This community saw an (unexpected) overall decrease in total contributions after introducing monetary rewards for posting reviews. Further examination across members finds a strong moderating effect of social connectedness. Specifically, contributions from less-connected members increased by 1,400%, while contributions from more-connected members declined by 90%.

387,"Research suggests that people overestimate the importance of minimal social cues in online contexts. In new relationships, there is also a tendency to use minimal cues to fill in the gaps and assume people we like are similar to ourselves. Extending the literature on impression formation in computer-mediated communication, we investigated the content and extent of impressions formed about an online stranger with a limited profile, as well as the tendency to form gender-stereotypic impressions. Participants viewed either a male or female Facebook profile consisting of general information and an avatar for a photo. Then, in their own words, they described their impressions of the target and provided ratings for various attributes (e.g., likeability and similarity to themselves). Spontaneous descriptions were generally positive (the target was frequently described as educated, outgoing, fun, and agreeable), and gender role stereotypes were present (the male target was more frequently described as athletic, the female target was more frequently described as creative and friendly). The target was perceived to be quite similar and likeable to participants. Moreover, there was a tendency to rate the target more positively than negatively, especially for personality versus appearance.

Although it would be difficult to eradicate all the potential vulnerabilities in advance, accessibility to a server can be controlled to limit or minimize the chance of exposing a vulnerable surface. We aimed to address the accessibility issue by designing and prototyping an Invi-server system, in which the IP and MAC addresses of the protected secret server remain invisible from external scanning and eavesdropping trials and even from compromised internal hosts on the network. This Invi-server system can be used as a way to reduce the attack surface of a protected server while allowing authorized users to send and receive packets via the protected server. We also implemented a prototype of the Invi-server system to demonstrate that our proposed system has the ability to reduce the attack surfaces significantly without increasing network performance overhead to any significant extent.","['Jae-Hyun Park', 'Jiseong Noh', 'Myungchul Kim', 'Brent ByungHoon Kang']",8e83789c-57fc-4ca9-b83d-ad03359746d3,0,"['19ff82c1-f4db-47b8-800b-b8b1ecb36c72', '26b501a0-fd14-4f5c-9fda-bec0968e6f65', '31173c18-63e8-45f4-a959-e0248f85273f', '3ec3f7e2-5c27-418f-8ec3-9e483eb41d47', '4452a830-dc33-49d2-be22-f0ae3472554e', '5f20636f-e947-4f1c-a7bc-7e10dc36e1d5', '603850e2-059b-4f01-bbb8-ec0a07eaa445', '6e24d8c8-e0a6-4080-8c41-abf15aa1a403', '73dcda51-10c7-4fec-b444-c58ba944d0c3', '7c269f30-f939-4cfe-bd3a-3a93d8dba585', '8cd6186f-c9cc-491c-b07e-8824f4d6c1c0', '9867b173-39bd-4cd9-a3f4-1b1d7289edec', 'abf7f290-5b74-4b9a-9661-a1af46b0083a', 'c3a5c848-4fe2-45e2-ac25-0a40ec2b8e5e', 'c9516f65-d249-4a89-814f-de6b0a8da315', 'cc69c615-e7e7-4448-a776-83b563873f0e', 'ce5e172f-64bb-4ccd-a3ee-ebe344148698', 'df694c50-0783-4b7c-a94e-33683962ba8e', 'e3a35634-dd58-474d-a11d-fc1dd2148af7', 'e75e44f2-aa1b-4346-b397-b717fdfb33b5', 'e93140f8-ff5c-45c0-abd2-57dd471f4ed0', 'f3392a9a-7b89-44a8-b92e-f6a182b7cf8b']",Invi-server: Reducing the attack surfaces by making protected server invisible on networks,Computers & Security,2017
389,"Insect disturbance are important agents of change in forest ecosystems around the globe, yet their spatial and temporal distribution and dynamics are not well understood. Remote sensing has gained much attention in mapping and understanding insect outbreak dynamics. Consequently, we here review the current literature on the remote sensing of insect disturbances. We suggest to group studies into three insect types: bark beetles, broadleaved defoliators, and coniferous defoliators. By so doing, we systematically compare the sensors and methods used for mapping insect disturbances within and across insect types. Results suggest that there are substantial differences between methods used for mapping bark beetles and defoliators, and between methods used for mapping broadleaved and coniferous defoliators. Following from this, we highlight approaches that are particularly suited for each insect type. Finally, we conclude by highlighting future research directions for remote sensing of insect disturbances. In particular, we suggest to: 1) Separate insect disturbances from other agents; 2) Extend the spatial and temporal domain of analysis; 3) Make use of dense time series; 4) Operationalize near-real time monitoring of insect disturbances; 5) Identify insect disturbances in the context of coupled human-natural systems; and 6) Improve reference data for assessing insect disturbances. Since the remote sensing of insect disturbances has gained much interest beyond the remote sensing community recently, the future developments identified here will help integrating remote sensing products into operational forest management. Furthermore, an improved spatiotemporal quantification of insect disturbances will support an inclusion of these processes into regional to global ecosystem models.","['Cornelius Senf', 'Rupert Seidl', 'Patrick Hostert']",6eee88c2-8a8d-4605-929e-fee2a3333eec,0,"['1ab3d445-ad11-467d-a0a4-02c2594fe7cb', '1bae5da3-225b-4484-8827-48e0e8727cca', '1f812cd8-d112-4938-aac2-d55d8a04b82c', '5725e654-0f60-4f46-bde6-c3c2f51e7e25', '6f5aa735-85c1-4134-b3f4-26096299bd76', '7817c452-e3da-4e84-917a-c845d0510272', '900cb6c9-95e7-46c5-b66d-02894866f676', 'a17e9cec-0968-4c53-a24e-a61519795fe1', 'af4c9b66-7687-4fb3-a614-1088e2b2d1fd', 'af95564b-3a06-43dd-b83e-86009a772523', 'cb9852ba-b995-4c31-bc07-fb4b3e7bbd86']",Remote sensing of forest insect disturbances: Current state and future directions,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2017
390,"Bacterial sRNA-mediated regulatory networks has been introduced as a powerful way to analyze the fast rewiring capabilities of a bacteria in response to changing environmental conditions. The identification of mRNA targets of bacterial sRNAs is essential to investigate their functional activities. However, this step remains challenging with the lack of knowledge of the topological and biological constraints behind the formation of sRNA-mRNA duplexes. Even with the most sophisticated bioinformatics target prediction tools, the large proportion of false predictions may be prohibitive for further analyses. To deal with this issue, sRNA target analyses can be carried out from the resulting gene lists given by RNA-SEQ experiments when available. However, the number of resulting target candidates may be still huge and cannot be easily interpreted by domain experts who need to confront various biological features to prioritize the target candidates. Therefore, novel strategies have to be carried out to improve the specificity of computational prediction results, before proposing new candidates for an expensive experimental validation stage. To address this issue, we propose a new visualization tool rNAV 2.0, for detecting and filtering bacterial sRNA targets for regulatory networks. rNAV is designed to cope with a variety of biological constraints, including the gene annotations, the conserved regions of interaction or specific patterns of regulation. Depending on the application, these constraints can be variously combined to analyze the target candidates, prioritized for instance by a known conserved interaction region, or because of a common function. The standalone application implements a set of known algorithms and interaction techniques, and applies them to the new problem of identifying reasonable sRNA target candidates.","['Romain Bourqui', 'Isabelle Dutour', 'Jonathan Dubois', 'William Benchimol', 'Patricia Thébault']",e1bf5bc4-2989-405e-9fd0-13a5a137df0f,0,"['04c2737d-3016-4674-892e-7cc0543376c1', '58345ac3-4706-4e71-8473-d0781e57cc4e', '80a4d06c-dde4-4fdb-b4e2-e15fc0a56f44', '988597d2-8dbc-413b-804f-33f6b3707aff', 'a3fb788e-82ee-4c63-99d7-aac1d3db801e', 'b39b32cf-57a3-493c-8b46-2a40913fe130', 'b887d8bc-33fa-458d-9678-d4a82d08d779', 'c0a63a5f-54d5-4511-b78a-d0372a1e6924', 'f6f2f27a-1819-4e6b-9508-736f174cc0ea', 'fb04a5a1-a491-461a-a65e-07eabb2d28c9', 'fbc36fbe-7284-497a-a504-c9d21063a770']",rNAV 2.0: a visualization tool for bacterial sRNA-mediated regulatory networks mining,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
391,"Open Computing Language (OpenCL) is a high-level language that allows developers to produce portable software for heterogeneous parallel computing platforms. OpenCL is available for a variety of hardware platforms, with compiler support being recently expanded to include Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This article investigates flexible OpenCL designs for the iterative min-sum decoding algorithm for (3,6)-regular Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over a range of codeword lengths. The target FPGA hardware is the Altera Stratix V GX A7 based Nallatech 385n board. The computationally demanding LDPC decoding algorithm offers several forms of parallelism that could be exploited by the Altera Offline Compiler (AOC version 15.1) for OpenCL. Our best decoder design produced a corrected codeword throughput of 68.22 Mbps at the compiler-selected FPGA clock frequency of 163.88 MHz for a length-2048 (3,6)-regular LDPC code. For a length-1024 (3,6)-regular LDPC code, our best design produced a throughput of 54.8 Mbps (32 decoding iterations) which significantly improves on the throughput of around 7 Mbps (30 decoding iterations) produced by an OpenCL based decoder design reported by Falcao et al. for the same size of LDPC code.","['Andrew J.

The hybrid mesh replaces the triangles of the Shishkin mesh by rectangles in the layer regions. The supercloseness results are established that the computed solution converges to the interpolant of the true solution with 3/2 order and 2 order (up to a logarithmic factor) on the two kinds of mesh, respectively. These convergence rates are uniformly valid with respect to the diffusion parameter and imply that the hybrid mesh is superior to the Shishkin triangular mesh. Numerical experiments illustrate these theoretical results.","['Xiaowei Liu', 'Jin Zhang']",a305371c-62f0-4e19-865a-464a8a545842,0,"['45daf4a0-f28d-4893-9739-3a98f857e1b4', '52722fc9-8401-4d4c-8ee7-f6ebb64cad0d', '542e206c-4a42-47db-9dff-20336118f88a', '61b304a2-6143-42ae-b160-2e22516fa2d5', '77550de5-b569-4b39-8250-7949f55734fc', '8b7dfc8f-ec46-46f0-bb4f-33abb2c66263', 'd3207212-b3d4-47a8-9701-26a98df9dbec', 'edf0310b-d2be-48c5-a3b0-53115e9e01b7']",Galerkin finite element methods for convection–diffusion problems with exponential layers on Shishkin triangular meshes and hybrid meshes,Applied Mathematics and Computation,2017

However, conventional CF and its variants with single layer factorization fail to capture the intrinsic structure of data. In this paper, we propose a novel sequential factorization method, namely Graph regularized Multilayer Concept Factorization (GMCF) for clustering. GMCF is a multi-stage procedure, which decomposes the observation matrix iteratively in a number of layers. In addition, GMCF further incorporates graph Laplacian regularization in each layer to efficiently preserve the manifold structure of data. An efficient iterative updating scheme is developed for optimizing GMCF. The convergence of this algorithm is strictly proved; the computational complexity is detailedly analyzed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMCF owns the superiorities in terms of data representation and clustering performance.","['Xue Li', 'Xiaobo Shen', 'Zhenqiu Shu', 'Qiaolin Ye', 'Chunxia Zhao']",bbb3c3b4-5588-415a-967f-da79ee5f558b,0,"['04bf14c3-fc94-4321-9efe-55654a47910c', '05bbaec3-7980-4941-8638-2bbfa4ac8be0', '0f90894d-0093-4fe1-9b47-b15324fc02ee', '1544035e-053d-497d-8c81-09a368317de9', '199193a1-7f8f-4c9d-814a-97c5a71ffd63', '1b5f78dd-e735-4547-9a4b-247ea14d7924', '1d0d258f-be30-4f91-8121-bf4e1cac2fc0', '29d1f8f8-2aa4-4591-a16a-c07b65ae86a5', '341187b9-26d1-494b-b6a6-51ed46a4d866', '35b168a4-99bb-4a5e-a57e-b8fa2bab9dde', '3996a3b5-830f-4e97-9ad5-7eae74015188', '3b9e7378-1b87-4371-b6c5-9828941e3c9c', '4928aa7c-c5fd-465a-b46d-b35a764953e1', '494b497b-836b-445a-8bcb-095600835d89', '52cab5b6-8329-46ec-9c99-6f8c78712be8', '56f4b72a-ec39-47ac-8220-899296e7fb18', '6258b77f-d346-4948-80ff-940d3c02e9a0', '67af4abb-616f-4075-ab3d-f8bb6fbb0290', '6db92f25-517d-46e5-b4c1-d41f4b441048', '7152c676-829b-4c7f-bbda-e418d534c9f5', '72267584-7166-46a5-b166-1e5aaf498a68', '782643a1-eb23-4f5f-9bf3-a8d0ca206e48', '7cf4ddaa-0105-4fba-8c47-3ae561b1cadc', '7f396022-7a24-462c-afbe-a7db6fc818e1', '807af84a-2cb8-45b3-bbff-fa2109e839da', '81180100-2a88-4e6c-a0cd-dbff17a50625', '839e59b8-b356-4329-ba79-97f981cf6768', '852c55d7-4400-48f3-b402-d5ad0456d853', '8665a1dd-1e57-437c-be16-446fa785ca80', '876d9f73-86e8-4af2-87cc-adaf94b2912f', '88fa5458-021e-42cd-82bd-b95cce455ba3', '8d12f3e4-a581-46d9-b97f-e42b14e1340a', '8dffe72a-5e95-42ce-9878-4b6fd4f15d20', '93a34a61-aa50-4cb2-b60e-ec1e95674dd3', '9898ea1d-bcce-42e9-83ee-50a8c24802a9', 'a3139706-2d5e-4187-b0bd-712e0803e7d4', 'adf7c7c8-c3fc-4d60-8382-711d1e6cfebb', 'beadb69a-4cca-47c7-b959-88efba06e6df', 'c0b72b93-c8ca-4409-a7e2-ac58630446ca', 'c472bfe1-9ef6-43c6-89b5-a86b22c9f5df', 'c56c3480-7aa3-474e-b0bc-a228d7d64ef5', 'c5d73f15-467c-4824-8784-4bf66630fe94', 'c878c073-5183-4ae7-b90a-1a574060b161', 'cbff2ff2-6b8f-425d-a5ef-aff0de9be3e5', 'cfb7aeb0-977b-409d-a462-9b8bce777b1e', 'd57374ad-a533-4ac7-b552-c070aac69e8c', 'e69c336e-aeb3-4d9f-8249-78b6fe600646']",Graph regularized multilayer concept factorization for data representation,Neurocomputing,2017

395,"Abstract  The current treatment paradigm in  Clostridium difficile  infection is the administration of antibiotics contributing to the high rates of recurrent infections. Recent alternative strategies, such as fecal microbiome transplantation and anti-toxin antibodies, have shown similar efficacy in the treatment of  C. difficile  associated disease (CDAD). However, barriers exist for either treatment or other novel treatments to displace antibiotics as the standard of care. To aid in the comparison of these and future treatments in CDAD, we developed an  in silico  pipeline to predict clinical efficacy with nonclinical results. The pipeline combines an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based model, describing the immunological and microbial interactions in the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, with machine learning algorithms to translate simulated output quantities (i.e. time of clearance, quantity of commensal bacteria, T cell ratios) into clinical predictions based on prior preclinical, translational and clinical trial data. As a use case, we compare the efficacy of lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2), a novel immunoregulatory target with promising efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), activation with antibiotics, fecal microbiome transplantation and anti-toxin antibodies in the treatment of CDAD. We further validate the potential of LANCL2 pathway activation, in a mouse model of  C. difficile  infection in which it displays an ability to decrease weight loss and inflammatory cell types while protecting against mortality. The computational pipeline can serve as an important resource in the development of new treatment modalities.","['Andrew Leber', 'Raquel Hontecillas', 'Vida Abedi', 'Nuria Tubau-Juni', 'Victoria Zoccoli-Rodriguez', 'Caroline Stewart', 'Josep Bassaganya-Riera']",0faa1120-7bf9-4b37-b607-ea41d0c4f619,0,"['37a90b62-e881-4cec-acd3-6e2ccd9078b3', '89618d3b-a7c4-487d-8876-936e58c9d494', 'b16258b9-4559-4c07-b4ff-eb0ec02a3eb2', 'c83b08c7-3bc6-4342-bc41-91eeb1f8bf90', 'd38f60ed-7306-4daf-af46-aabc13e8adf7']",Modeling new immunoregulatory therapeutics as antimicrobial alternatives for treating Clostridium difficile infection,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,2017

The differential equations based ANNs modeling of the Falkner-Skan system is constructed by defining an unsupervised error function. The training of the design parameters of ANNs is carried out with the help of viable global search through GAs and fine tuning of the results is achieved with an efficient local search using the AS method. The proposed scheme is applied to a number of scenarios for the Falkner-Skan system based on boundary layer flow over a moving wall with mass transfer in the presence of a free stream with power-law velocity distributions. The dynamics of the system are investigated for different cases of mass transfer and wall stretching. The proposed results are compared with analytical and numerical solutions to verify the correctness of the approach. The accuracy and convergence of the proposed solver are validated through sufficient large numbers of independent runs in terms of different performance indices based on mean absolute error, Thail’s inequality coefficient and Nash-Suitcliff efficiency. These solutions greatly enrich possible approaches for stochastic numerical solution of the celebrated Falkner-Skan system.","['Muhammad Asif Zahoor Raja', 'Shahid Azad', 'Syed Muslim Shah']",4bb34564-4a60-4cab-9fb9-f514ba1ac9ff,0,"['08908266-12af-4eda-864b-8eec59f5e3f6', '0a61b70a-0d1c-40d4-ba94-4dfaeb96ede6', '1b609691-c80e-4ebf-a92d-dc95b832e2ab', '1d6b7a53-60a1-4e67-87ff-930166bbaf95', '1eca51b1-6ed2-4835-bc2c-2507a1bbe264', '4bd6c108-b941-421c-884a-25c9939a6de0', '644c9086-d721-4bbb-9010-e53a29f8e7a9', '669d682d-3413-4fe4-8bc6-3e0354337bdc', '696edc19-b372-42be-b985-39c141ea25cc', '6a9929d2-2ae9-40cb-b4ea-d06b4e1acd25', '7b1655d0-f4a5-46f5-bc48-0d95555d1b79', '7e80af39-9768-4dca-a9fa-81c93b3480e0', '840c79c4-1061-4072-9b96-3d2a4151cf34', '84488c7d-b3cc-4862-a306-a1d014d17365', '99455f6b-4793-446e-b6af-94439592c122', 'a5445fcb-8439-48f3-b8f2-6b4f9c420682', 'a580e047-46ef-454f-a0a9-3e948238764b', 'a80ac569-bdb9-47bc-ba00-6bac35e5965e', 'ba299806-b273-47db-8f64-d622cb8cf042', 'bbeb2cc6-09a8-4557-bdc2-b3d197f1a36b', 'c786b4e0-bc68-4340-a659-147045c734e7', 'd38f60ed-7306-4daf-af46-aabc13e8adf7', 'daea1e17-219c-4f86-9a71-49aed1acd8df', 'db5c8841-8b08-4449-9168-ef72f9f11684']",Bio-inspired computational heuristics to study the boundary layer flow of the Falkner-Scan system with mass transfer and wall stretching,Applied Soft Computing,2017
397,"This article presents an integrated modeling method which can provide superior quality of service (QoS) for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) suitable for smart distribution grid (SDG) communication. The existing QoS model which is based on IEEE 802.15.4 protocol cannot meet the communication time requirements of multi-type communication data. An enhanced QoS medium access control model based on unfair competition channel access mechanism is built, in order to conform with power system communication specification. The model can guarantee that the communication system of WSNs provides different qualities of service for different types of communication data. According to different requirements of the communication time for SDG data, the communication data of SDG are divided into three types: high priority, middle priority and low priority. State transition of buffer queues data in nodes is described by a three-dimensional Markov chain model. Delay time mode, channel collision model, and effective throughput rate mode of network data are developed respectively to analyze WSN performance of SDG communication. The analysis and simulation results show that the model proposed in this paper can provide effective QoS for monitoring and communication of SDG.","['Jianping Wang', 'Ruju Fang', 'Wei Sun']",517f8fc8-2f33-41b1-afc0-6e6388e21f4e,50,"['15cecf0c-5778-44e5-9dc8-c1a44f424f97', '2476d035-9cd0-47e6-a4e3-b535325ac7ef', '5ca029d5-75f2-4cbe-bf36-914ad2cee99d', '71891347-d90a-47fa-962f-43ffcc5a41f2', '85352dec-58be-43db-a428-f3f574ff96ec', '8b03b8b4-861d-456f-a25d-047c6a5618bb', 'cbcec649-2224-4537-ade5-9c5d38152c10', 'd3a6b91d-9fad-4438-82e2-ac405428cae2', 'e9e45e77-7dd0-4da0-9e74-b4d468626027']",QoS Modeling of Wireless Sensor Networks in Smart Distribution Grid Communication,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

First, the integer-order Butterworth (IOB) filter is reviewed and the design problem of digital FOB filter is described. Then, the discrete cosine transform (DCT), discrete sine transform (DST) and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) are applied to obtain the transfer functions of FIR fractional order Butterworth filters. Because the closed-form designs are obtained, the filter coefficients are easily computed. Next, the variable FOB filter is designed using the Farrow structure and IIR FOB filter is designed by the Prony method. Finally, application examples in the digital image sharpening are studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed FOB filter design approaches.","['Chien-Cheng Tseng', 'Su-Ling Lee']",10a93329-d841-49e1-9a2e-608edb793656,0,"['08e8c27f-8904-4e80-9f5f-a26a9c863433', '14962a64-75b2-4db6-8201-0dce2dfd81e5', '2f5d0a2a-1dea-4596-bf50-a08a0d2b3d4f', '30981e22-928c-42f4-af5a-b514bd343a33', '4e0c803e-b78b-46b6-b2a1-fcfdadf97625', '5524d4a0-c733-40c3-bb9d-74ed6f3874d4', '6cc4330d-7101-44a7-979a-bb311dc1dd4d', '6d5f4675-a888-4106-9287-b4b32a9ee592', '70c40071-4a82-49ae-8dfe-f76a5af452fd', '87b81603-4413-455e-8416-824fc1360891', '98e7d47a-ce8a-4eaa-b27b-4e937e5e346b', '9c7c1553-2878-416b-bdc8-5d48aa063d42', '9ca3b1d4-1774-473e-bb9c-1c83f5ae3c52', 'a14610ad-4776-466a-bcd7-797c334d915d', 'b598c408-b047-4042-8955-757ccc374e7d', 'b8c8a485-a658-486e-9850-82cc46f016e2', 'cd330180-b0a9-447b-94b0-976c8380be86', 'f5ea70e5-f9e6-48e1-8b93-949a9f317e9e']",Closed-form designs of digital fractional order Butterworth filters using discrete transforms,Signal Processing,2017
399,"The replenishment of resource management problem is tough and necessary in RFID system, which requires tags to report the existing information uninterruptedly for guaranteeing goods supply. However, the random or synchronous reply may lead to collision, further, make the system low efficiency. Based on the fusion method between orthogonal code compiling category ID and analogy principle, we present the collision tolerance protocol UACP to identify tags efficiently, which contains UCOM and ACAM mechanisms. UCOM relies on orthogonal signals’ correlation to realize the tolerance and accurate category identification by making a comparison between the collision and the whole elements. ACAM depends on the analogy principle to estimate the existing number from microcosmic to macrocosmic only using the singleton slots, and the tags can transmit one-bit affirming message after a series of ACK commands. UACP also analyses some factors, such as the permutation and combination of multiple sets orthogonal codes, asynchronous code offset, signal missing rate, signal misjudgment probability, and shows the advantages on slot utilization rate, identification rate and time efficiency compared with other algorithms. After adopting BPSK modulation and USRP platform, UACP is verified the time-efficiency increasing of 25–60%.","['Jumin Zhao', 'Na Li', 'Dengao Li', 'Ruiqin Bai', 'Biaokai Zhu', 'Xinyi Liu']",347a42ba-eef5-4623-be3b-9f3ec4230271,0,"['0a51d96a-4212-4098-a7a0-07cd0139aaab', '16f8c247-d5cf-4de2-af2e-4c12b0106a9a', '1fe324cb-ead3-4b17-8b73-75ae41f7fac4', '27e834d1-fc47-43db-a386-6aff929dbf89', '375677a6-4be4-42a0-afb4-11a881861f97', '42597148-f59f-43b4-9618-dab0de28c74a', '4d9a0730-dc08-4889-abb9-9647dc60e172', '718ab224-f196-4ae1-99b3-a2135fdc3086', '7ad964ac-4245-4325-be67-aa9d59bcc9cc', '7b0a6c50-f148-4846-a31e-81f2bf3fb862', '7e946010-15f9-443f-a230-534922f8f947', '803f4251-b6c5-4313-ac62-97e9271ce837', 'aad2f58f-09e6-471f-a788-7bb82463ce8d', 'ad1a8930-98cd-416a-8479-e73d086c87b8', 'b8bffaa0-c3c0-46fc-b40d-e55d304a3399', 'ccb50752-820d-4635-aa19-3a42cd9913f2', 'ce5dd55c-c01f-4e07-98f3-ebf5f0a3545d', 'e1a67b4b-85ed-43a6-80e1-17030ef86d80', 'e89b3971-081a-4237-9231-6d635a50322a', 'f3f47742-1fd5-4992-ac61-8ea95192cb51']",Collision alignment: an RFID anti-collision algorithm assisted by orthogonal signal detection and analogy principle,Telecommunication Systems,2017
400,"Linear representation-based methods play an important role in the development of the target appearance modeling in visual tracking. However, such linear representation scheme cannot accurately depict the nonlinearly distributed appearance variations of the target, which often leads to unreliable tracking results. To fix this issue, we introduce the kernel method into the locality-constrained linear coding algorithm to comprehensively exploit its nonlinear representation ability. Further, to fully consider the temporal correlation between neighboring frames, we develop a point-to-set distance metric with L2, 1 norm as the temporal smoothness constraint, which aims to guarantee that the object between the two consecutive frames should be represented by the similar dictionaries temporally. Experimental results on Object Tracking Benchmark show that the proposed tracker achieves promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","['Fanghui Liu', 'Tao Zhou', 'Keren Fu', 'Jie Yang']",97121a87-4cb4-4dab-a6bf-a9ee9ffcac34,0,"['073305d0-7b7b-4f5e-810e-74fb7a6bde52', '1b93b265-b667-496f-b70e-fa4ceee67eb3', '2d87894b-f5ba-4443-9932-2fb5ed4fb29e', '3c064b44-6fe1-49d0-a0d2-89c7ee180da2', '3fb9d0fc-7031-4be2-a81d-af9a81ca4c12', '4beff121-d66f-4048-a832-5200294d17c4', '5f5f1d00-4b9a-483b-b54a-ae746885401b', '6f2ceefd-d0e8-4926-9a2d-81335b503ed2', '745b1cd9-abc7-4b3a-afed-7fa9c375f27b', '76983f27-84d6-4516-9f81-03aa94c99c63', '7cdd68ef-876b-4214-bd85-38dd01ac99c9', '8210446d-574a-493e-94e0-2661dd722b09', '83c737b8-e084-4766-ba6e-131e6a1c017c', '9152e7b9-135e-49d7-82b7-831b6305f64f', '99c3b344-f698-4e6a-a419-efcad3c232c9', '9ec0d4e8-8b5d-476b-9b8f-137e09705d10', 'a083a1b9-8dfb-45d6-99a9-fa30c4a6e9f5', 'a93800b7-e73b-4d0a-92db-b0b3d6dc6851', 'c40ae5bb-32d4-4366-bfc7-fd7100a7057c', 'c5e509f1-51c9-4964-9242-491283fca091', 'ca1f3eeb-28e2-44e1-b82b-04739aab4e65', 'd16d0245-9454-4f15-a0f3-eea2e0bc5be7', 'd70c7185-f63a-4d38-be4f-2945d227c0f7', 'd892de5e-02a8-4efc-bfdd-45b621e01e9b', 'e01c6b27-b50b-470e-bf00-5d054974d52a', 'f51869d5-2777-4539-863b-6828684cf5b5', 'f6bff59f-de80-49f4-9aaf-1f0f47212365', 'fd744726-ee23-4073-98c8-b7c2529eb2a2', 'fde4a716-7c14-40c5-80c6-0717c6c394d4']",Kernelized temporal locality learning for real-time visual tracking,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017

402,"Abstract  Objectives  The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate detailed clinical models (DCMs) for nursing actions in perinatal care. We propose the use of action-target dyads as entities in DCMs for nursing actions.  Methods  We identified action and target concepts, attributes, and value sets by analyzing nursing documentation and reviewing the wider literature, in addition to published standards and models. We developed the DCMs by linking entities, attributes, and value sets. DCMs were classified by action type based on the Clinical Care Classification, and by target type based on the axes of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP). Attributes in the DCMs were also classified by ICNP axes. The quality of the DCMs was evaluated by domain experts, and their coverage was evaluated by mapping narrative nursing statements.  Results  Nursing DCMs consisting of 233 entities (dyads comprising 34 action and 212 target concepts), 214 attributes and 541 values were developed. The most frequent action type was hands-on care (43.3%). The focus axis was used most frequently for the targets (51.9%) and attributes (38.8%). The quality scores of the DCMs ranged from 0.80 to 0.96. Most (174/192; 90.6%) of the statements were fully mapped, while 7 (3.7%) were partially mapped and 11 (5.7%) were not mapped. We modified the DCMs in accordance with these results.  Conclusions  In total, 240 DCMs were developed with action-target dyads as entities. The DCMs developed in this study could be implemented in an electronic nursing record system to enhance nursing practices and ensure semantic interoperability of nursing data.","['Joo Yun Lee', 'Hyeoun-Ae Park']",8fc12ab4-60d8-45de-9fb2-370f8201e50c,0,"['0b8d8490-9a77-4d4c-bc2f-a45c330fc2b6', '1d220448-663c-4f9c-9ba5-e402aeca3401', '75e5fe67-e2c4-48a0-88af-cce3e1b12094', '8118e72c-b285-4242-85a3-ccdfe67e2acf', 'a458a5c0-3e98-41ad-93a5-57257c738941', 'b7627a71-df8f-4712-9869-7a51c7e3cd8d', 'e2da2465-7a56-43b0-8be4-ef331b19b8c7']",Development and validation of detailed clinical models for nursing actions in perinatal care,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2017

404,"Current studies of influence maximization focus almost exclusively on unsigned social networks ignoring the polarities of the relationships between users. Influence maximization in signed social networks containing both positive relationships ( e.g. , friend or like) and negative relationships ( e.g. , enemy or dislike) is still a challenging problem which remains much open. A few studies made use of greedy algorithms to solve the problem of positive influence or negative influence maximization in signed social networks. Although greedy algorithm is able to achieve a good approximation, it is computational expensive and not efficient enough. Aiming at this drawback, we propose an alternative method based on Simulated Annealing (SA) for the positive influence maximization problem in this paper. Additionally, we also propose two heuristics to speed up the convergence process of the proposed method. Comprehensive experiments results on three signed social network datasets, Epinions, Slashdot and Wikipedia, demonstrate that our method can yield similar or better performance than the greedy algorithms in terms of positive influence spread but run faster.","['Dong Li', 'Cuihua Wang', 'Shengping Zhang', 'Guanglu Zhou', 'Dian-Hui Chu', 'Chong Wu']",28ea2256-4abd-4968-bc9e-89dec6d22c7e,0,"['0d4708bf-4904-4837-ab31-15caf2c9d896', '112afa38-3205-4391-b92a-f1f3986e2ed4', '196ef9a2-5255-4739-a6b9-c742b08380af', '27e60e90-3f57-45b3-a034-df7b906425bc', '2c490022-8325-49ae-a129-652d9664451d', '2d32436c-81a5-40de-be75-9949d22cf790', '36350300-b5f5-441d-b894-c9ecca272f65', '381d018d-a073-4f88-ab72-22f5899e06f7', '402fa28e-adf1-4fe9-b182-1825bfec996c', '43a939dc-91e9-473b-8da6-43c65c18e54f', '4d10b522-57b8-4922-ba59-cee3f9cecba8', '58caaa7a-625c-483b-ad7e-ceedf9b668dd', '91e0332e-9dcb-43c0-b0e5-15e2bc0cfbaf', '95a40843-cb95-40b3-bd07-d3f9cf566b75', '96328fc9-d54f-4bd9-9637-2d0484967cc4', '9863baf6-d69f-495a-8d5a-71442adea84e', '98e67229-36db-4902-af27-db2195f85f57', 'a6a35c0b-4b23-4136-80b0-8a5c6f058677', 'aec4a087-c56b-48ad-9dd8-0c866c42c102', 'b66ac250-4b35-45f4-93f2-797d17485c05', 'cb558105-71b2-44fc-aef6-77dbce3eec2e', 'd432475b-0533-4abd-a23f-89c1ea5e6e27', 'e47731f7-89b0-40af-a98b-7447c8c524f0', 'eae3710c-909b-468d-afac-07ae5cf641d7', 'ecdaa205-2273-4633-b0a2-bb0aab6d43b7']",Positive influence maximization in signed social networks based on simulated annealing,Neurocomputing,2017

Then, the Bayesian probability of each substructure was calculated and labeled (positive or negative for DILI), and a weighted fingerprint was determined from the ratio of DILI-positive to DILI-negative probability values. Using weighted fingerprint features, the prediction models were trained and evaluated with the Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The constructed models yielded accuracies of 73.8% and 72.6%, AUCs of 0.791 and 0.768 in cross-validation. In independent tests, models achieved accuracies of 60.1% and 61.1% for RF and SVM, respectively. The results validated that weighted features helped increase overall performance of prediction models. The constructed models were further applied to the prediction of natural compounds in herbs to identify DILI potential, and 13,996 unique herbal compounds were predicted as DILI-positive with the SVM model. The prediction models with weighted features increased the performance compared to non-weighted models. Moreover, we predicted the DILI potential of herbs with the best performed model, and the prediction results suggest that many herbal compounds could have potential to be DILI. We can thus infer that taking natural products without detailed references about the relevant pathways may be dangerous. Considering the frequency of use of compounds in natural herbs and their increased application in drug development, DILI labeling would be very important.","['Eunyoung Kim', 'Hojung Nam']",58182b78-67ce-4bb7-af1d-3e22a207710f,50,"['2f00e0c6-f49a-46ee-b65d-b51844de5f68', '39e1313c-0158-4719-958f-4a687c23d16f', '6aa4515a-494c-48ff-9870-debc3e4cb890', 'bbaa79e6-81b9-48f0-9851-5eb77f0e9d1c', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'd690cc52-7822-4c4f-ac9e-e4a59c5141e8']",Prediction models for drug-induced hepatotoxicity by using weighted molecular fingerprints,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
406,"Previous empirical examinations of the relationship between Internet use and civic engagement indicate the potential of both positive and negative directionality of the effects of Internet use on civic engagement activities, from marching in protests to joining clubs and other organizations. Compounding this multitude of possibilities is the fact that civic engagement is no longer something which occurs solely in the offline world, with vast new possibilities for, and forms of, civic activity also existing in the online realm. In order to shed new light on this relationship, the current study will explore the effects of Internet use on both online and offline civic engagement, as well as the interaction between online and offline types of civic engagement. Using survey data, and utilizing a structural equation analysis, the results of this study suggest that certain types of Internet use do indeed relate positively with offline civic engagement, though this relationship is mediated through online civic activities. Findings also suggest cyclical relationships between online and offline forms of civic engagement. The conclusions from this study include practical applications for influencing civic engagement in the digital age, as well as changing the way that both Internet use and civic engagement are measured.",['Simon Purdy'],7cb7cae2-b327-472e-8def-06eeac246c8d,0,"['2c4c42fc-a7cb-44ca-837f-caa93540e44b', '369901c9-d01b-437e-8b1c-47dd3820401e', '84a88281-24f1-4c22-8ff0-07783bcf6a3c', 'ac744614-9003-4ccb-93bf-2fe5b1ef4166']",Internet use and civic engagement: A structural equation approach,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
407,"Multi-modalities action recognition becomes a hot research topic, and this paper proposes a collaborative sparse representation leaning model for RGB-D action recognition where RGB and depth information are adaptive fused. Specifically, dense trajectory feature is firstly extracted and Bag-of-Word (BoW) weight scheme is employed for RGB modality, and then for depth modality, the human pose representation model (HPM) and temporal modeling (TM) representation are utilized. Meanwhile, the collaborative reconstruction structure and corresponding objective functions for the multiple modalities are designed, and then the proposed model is collaboratively optimized which is used to discover the latent complementary information between RGB and depth data. Finally, the collaborative reconstruction error is employed as our classification scheme. Large scale experimental results on challenging and public DHA, M2I and Northwestern-UCLA action datasets show that the performances of our model on two modalities are much better than traditional sole modality, which can boost the performance of human action recognition by taking advance of complementary characteristics from both RGB and depth modalities.","['Zan Gao', 'Sha Li', 'Yajuan Zhu', 'Wang C', 'H.

410,"This paper performs a complexity analysis of a class of serial and parallel compositional models of multiple objects and shows that they enable efficient representation and rapid inference. Compositional models are generative and represent objects in a hierarchically distributed manner in terms of parts and subparts, which are constructed recursively by part-subpart compositions. Parts are represented more coarsely at higher level of the hierarchy, so that the upper levels give coarse summary descriptions (e.g., there is a horse in the image) while the lower levels represents the details (e.g., the positions of the legs of the horse). This hierarchically distributed representation obeys the executive summary principle, meaning that a high level executive only requires a coarse summary description and can, if necessary, get more details by consulting lower level executives. The parts and subparts are organized in terms of hierarchical dictionaries which enables part sharing between different objects allowing efficient representation of many objects. The first main contribution of this paper is to show that compositional models can be mapped onto a parallel visual architecture similar to that used by bio-inspired visual models such as deep convolutional networks but more explicit in terms of representation, hence enabling part detection as well as object detection, and suitable for complexity analysis. Inference algorithms can be run on this architecture to exploit the gains caused by part sharing and executive summary. Effectively, this compositional architecture enables us to perform exact inference simultaneously over a large class of generative models of objects. The second contribution is an analysis of the complexity of compositional models in terms of computation time (for serial computers) and numbers of nodes (e.g., ""neurons"") for parallel computers. In particular, we compute the complexity gains by part sharing and executive summary and their dependence on how the dictionary scales with the level of the hierarchy. We explore three regimes of scaling behavior where the dictionary size (i) increases exponentially with the level of the hierarchy, (ii) is determined by an unsupervised compositional learning algorithm applied to real data, (iii) decreases exponentially with scale. This analysis shows that in some regimes the use of shared parts enables algorithms which can perform inference in time linear in the number of levels for an exponential number of objects. In other regimes part sharing has little advantage for serial computers but can enable linear processing on parallel computers.","['Alan L.

411,"Typed models of connector/component composition specify interfaces describing ports of components and connectors. Typing ensures that these ports are plugged together appropriately, so that data can flow out of each output port and into an input port. These interfaces typically consider the direction of data flow and the type of values flowing. Components, connectors, and systems are often parameterised in such a way that the parameters affect the interfaces. Typing such connector families is challenging. This paper takes a first step towards addressing this problem by presenting a calculus of connector families with integer and boolean parameters. The calculus is based on monoidal categories, with a dependent type system that describes the parameterised interfaces of these connectors. We use families of Reo connectors as running examples, and show how this calculus can be applied to Petri Nets and to BIP systems. The paper focuses on the structure of connectors—well-connectedness—and less on their behaviour, making it easily applicable to a wide range of coordination and component-based models. A type-checking algorithm based on constraints is used to analyse connector families, supported by a proof-of-concept implementation.","['José Proença', 'Dave Clarke']",efe28818-6fca-470a-838f-6b1a8f662318,0,"['086ecad6-ead0-43c3-892d-ee3b8d9a460d', '0d8a7c94-ebd3-47e9-aa46-bc7120d00aab', '11b2ff92-1c2a-499e-9938-8674acb0630e', '3ac62a82-475e-436d-9cb2-2ff40e7c52c2', '3e5008a4-6d9f-41e0-8670-8814c5b9edcf', '489fdb2b-fa04-46b7-9ef0-e31b7ef9bc84', '49030f7c-e006-47d2-bc32-c930a81ed7e4', '561e6a59-ad01-4d0d-8227-67af2bd162af', '5b481085-2908-4648-beb0-e999c03b5520', '5e6f185f-1442-4ccb-95f1-8bc93768214a', '6765e240-65f1-4744-904c-11d24637d940', '6bec1e50-be1e-4953-b99a-421e774cb650', '76667a54-9637-4f18-bc9e-6f70daa34152', '790302bf-0f55-4270-977b-0d13f87e0857', '84199316-ef9f-422c-b766-a93776fa71fb', '93b22478-94f8-4c15-ae03-ed98a856f60c', '93c54eef-5df4-4438-b01d-2536a382d06e', '952103b2-7ede-4216-ab18-bbecde6e4bd1', '9a4181a5-70d2-48b7-945d-8d72d9c74874', 'a6af6a2a-7087-4dd3-aa37-94722a3313e6', 'b25e243b-78d5-4514-8c07-b386f8260516', 'c6c3413f-2c37-42dc-bef2-4ae83b60882a', 'dc2ab368-c6dc-4ec4-beb3-1007a9a4b6b3']",Typed connector families and their semantics,Science of Computer Programming,2017
412,"In this paper, we study a V-cycle multigrid method for linear systems arising from time-dependent two-dimensional space-fractional diffusion equations. The coefficient matrices of the linear systems are structured such that their matrix-vector multiplications can be computed efficiently. The main advantage using the multigrid method is to handle the space-fractional diffusion equations on non-rectangular domains, and to solve the linear systems with non-constant coefficients more effectively. The main idea of the proposed multigrid method is to employ two banded splitting iteration schemes as pre-smoother and post-smoother. The pre-smoother and the post-smoother take banded splitting of the coefficient matrix under the x-dominant ordering and the y-dominant ordering, respectively. We prove the convergence of the proposed two banded splitting iteration schemes in the sense of infinity norm. Results of numerical experiments for time-dependent two-dimensional space-fractional diffusion equations on rectangular, L-shape and U-shape domains are reported to demonstrate that both computational time and iteration number required by the proposed method are significantly smaller than those of the other tested methods.","['Xue-lei Lin', 'Michael K.

413,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been applied as the classifiers for sequential labeling problems. In this paper, deep bidirectional RNNs (DBRNNs) are applied to error detection in automatic speech recognition (ASR), which is a sequential labeling problem. We investigate three types of ASR error detection tasks, i.e. confidence estimation, out-of-vocabulary word detection and error type classification. We also estimate ASR accuracy, i.e. percent correct and word accuracy, from the error type classification results. Experimental results using English and Japanese lecture speech corpora show that the DBRNNs greatly outperform conditional random fields (CRFs) and the other NN structures, i.e. deep feedforward NNs (DNNs) and deep unidirectional RNNs (DURNNs). These performance improvements are because the DBRNNs can take the longer bidirectional context of input feature vectors into account and can model highly nonlinear relationships between the input feature vectors and output labels. In detailed analyses, the DBRNNs show a better generalization ability than the CRFs. These results are thanks to the ability of the DBRNNs to represent (embed) the words in a low-dimensional continuous value vector space. In addition, the superiority of the DBRNNs to the DNNs and DURNNs indicates that the average length of the context of the input feature vectors required for ASR error detection is only a few time steps, however, it will change (lengthen) depending on the situation.","['Atsunori Ogawa', 'Takaaki Hori']",4cccb1c3-cb0c-4c19-9a08-775f13149aa2,0,"['0ac69c95-bf5c-485a-a5e9-ec47f08fb737', '0df95054-6f57-4e89-9c50-1b9dd870a263', '10706ee6-7f11-45ef-8069-65c59e75a964', '1240c849-5846-4ebd-812f-a86e1be600ad', '154b4e80-d134-4d8c-a53b-ab75834f8550', '17e4ec9e-7c09-4dc2-8175-2daf42061ac2', '2825ac89-53f4-4e29-b27d-878f7270f537', '296ec308-44b7-429b-ba2a-a73f6f7f5602', '2cb47115-21ef-491c-a9f8-07ac5e247793', '31f69b6b-592a-4d5d-b97f-76f111f18daa', '3a7c90a1-d168-41e2-83c6-8d8b3aa1c4fa', '4d5e207a-9733-4e2d-9743-e660c6306b5c', '4e0d2792-5f82-4e13-812c-781172f92e40', '545b4912-010f-4b6f-a7e6-3b83b75b51d5', '59235c9e-b171-44d3-a14a-3054fd825229', '5fbf65e3-9f93-4f64-845f-a906a2a3372e', '659f08d0-a5d3-4a2b-86fb-a39e7db2afc7', '66896a9c-5624-4ca7-9acf-3e2aa413ae92', '6c9d0b07-379f-4df6-b0c9-fb97d3463e65', '709cecbc-0c4c-4b3f-a0dd-acfc6032b789', '714794e0-879d-4b87-83a6-6478cc5b3b18', '72de5c25-c5dd-4292-9a27-5bdb36bda85d', '78c1a806-f666-4c40-ab13-faeb23f506a9', '8262312b-0380-47a5-8dd9-759c4e227deb', '8991d175-3e4d-4fbe-a208-f909e262952b', '89af7782-22fc-4c9d-9601-d7e6a9728844', '8b9e3f5c-7abb-4d1c-ba65-25111069fd28', '9082dbeb-5a9f-4fc7-b248-8851e2f491a9', 'a102415b-3a2a-47d7-9841-f45eb3be32c6', 'a33c65a3-b768-4d37-a3a7-d5129ecbad43', 'a4a3d706-b623-4262-b4b0-128c3264c789', 'a529bdf9-84e7-42ee-9ec6-85072abd6732', 'a93c47d9-2e64-44c5-ba79-688f110e9b09', 'ac1e8b38-3360-4c62-a8ae-01b764cc7d7c', 'ad785265-a174-4714-a2b9-29b22dac7eb0', 'ae829318-5d10-461d-9c99-34a95a3f8732', 'b6b47ac8-c6fb-48a4-a882-8a94a3006f28', 'bdd1c2bd-450f-4406-a718-211e99cd6ff1', 'c6117f89-0f22-446a-9202-d207bb9c1c69', 'c764db5c-285f-41ea-8461-20a25d3ba66a', 'cfc571c4-574d-4835-ac41-ead585c71d29', 'dae55971-8f4a-4ada-8066-27c346a42e0b', 'e8fc3c66-501b-4f69-84a4-e6d372ad8ed1', 'edad3bbd-d2b5-4bad-ad16-913e014dde15', 'f1c474ae-e3dd-43f3-9048-94593403e869', 'f643cf39-a5e7-45e0-ac73-2bb74eec9541', 'fa480ff7-df3a-4d61-b2fa-a297f68561de', 'fd1b7494-7d07-4d38-a1fe-4ade1aec343c', 'fec1b0f3-30d2-4877-8db9-2844eb9f8e2e', 'fff3565f-bdc0-4dda-a2b9-866ba93295a2']",Error detection and accuracy estimation in automatic speech recognition using deep bidirectional recurrent neural networks,Speech Communication,2017
414,"As mobile data traffic continues to grow significantly, traffic offloading is an important issue. Since WiFi-capable user equipments (UEs) are very popular nowadays and a Home evolved Node B+ (HeNB+), which is a Home evolved Node B (HeNB)/WiFi access point (WiFi AP) collocated access node, is a common commercial design, this paper proposed a novel and realistic scheme to utilize WiFi capacity for radio access network offloading such that service flows of a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) UE could be offloaded to WiFi as needed. To achieve this, three most important issues need to be conquered. First, the 3GPP UE needs to know the correct service set identification of the WiFi AP to offload traffic. Second, the WiFi AP needs to know the WiFi media access control address of the authorized UE to accept the corresponding access request. Third, the uplink offloaded service flow over WiFi needs to be recognized and be transmitted over the corresponding tunnel toward mobile core network. Based on the proposed architecture and solution, even service flows are offloaded to WiFi, UE is still attached to the collocated HeNB and therefore handover procedures will not be affected. In this paper, we also proposed the system design for implementation.","['Yu-Ching Hsu', 'Show-Shiow Tzeng']",7bd86f17-1475-4df0-885d-b7a46f7cf00b,0,"['1506c304-6349-4748-a512-fba6dfcc5ca3', '3732c32e-e7c3-4aca-b6b5-29eb4d61108f', '37ba4730-51d4-415f-a857-ece7b16878fb', '514cc7f9-4cb9-4a2c-bf35-2a9fbddccc35', '5edb628a-9c26-407e-83e6-73f3cbf7ed33', '6a892061-c006-4647-a5bb-9cadb978bf54', '6ddda446-7a14-4e77-86f6-293dc111e228', '812678b7-1e86-4c6a-b20d-aca0a93f0754', '83b3419a-d984-45f1-85e5-1e79bead2288', '8b7b4c45-fcf8-412e-9ce2-bae372086c48', '95f186b3-1f7d-4b4e-859a-209fae94805d', '9c58eb02-2fd0-46ed-be4b-1afcd6b7c536', 'a6c17eeb-0374-430a-ad5b-33683e7e2cbc', 'adc611ce-12b1-4f08-ba34-781c41d5e725', 'c10b34c4-fa7e-4c03-be7c-4297a305ed82', 'c3fdd0ca-97c4-4053-af7c-737202945ef7', 'e49ea81c-52b0-4b4c-a561-b4356f75c735']",A Pragmatic Design for 3GPP/WLAN RAN Level Interworking,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
415,"Biclustering has been largely applied for the unsupervised analysis of biological data, being recognised today as a key technique to discover putative modules in both expression data (subsets of genes correlated in subsets of conditions) and network data (groups of coherently interconnected biological entities). However, given its computational complexity, only recent breakthroughs on pattern-based biclustering enabled efficient searches without the restrictions that state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms place on the structure and homogeneity of biclusters. As a result, pattern-based biclustering provides the unprecedented opportunity to discover non-trivial yet meaningful biological modules with putative functions, whose coherency and tolerance to noise can be tuned and made problem-specific. To enable the effective use of pattern-based biclustering by the scientific community, we developed BicPAMS (Biclustering based on PAttern Mining Software), a software that: 1) makes available state-of-the-art pattern-based biclustering algorithms (BicPAM (Henriques and Madeira, Alg Mol Biol 9:27, 2014), BicNET (Henriques and Madeira, Alg Mol Biol 11:23, 2016), BicSPAM (Henriques and Madeira, BMC Bioinforma 15:130, 2014), BiC2PAM (Henriques and Madeira, Alg Mol Biol 11:1–30, 2016), BiP (Henriques and Madeira, IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinforma, 2015), DeBi (Serin and Vingron, AMB 6:1–12, 2011) and BiModule (Okada et al., IPSJ Trans Bioinf 48(SIG5):39–48, 2007)); 2) consistently integrates their dispersed contributions; 3) further explores additional accuracy and efficiency gains; and 4) makes available graphical and application programming interfaces. Results on both synthetic and real data confirm the relevance of BicPAMS for biological data analysis, highlighting its essential role for the discovery of putative modules with non-trivial yet biologically significant functions from expression and network data. BicPAMS is the first biclustering tool offering the possibility to: 1) parametrically customize the structure, coherency and quality of biclusters; 2) analyze large-scale biological networks; and 3) tackle the restrictive assumptions placed by state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms. These contributions are shown to be key for an adequate, complete and user-assisted unsupervised analysis of biological data.

416,"Cloud computing is a model which facilitate ubiquitous, convenient and on demand access to a shared pool of scalable and configurable computing resources. Cloud computing has made great impact on the information technology industries but still it faces lots of challenges like mobility in devices, load balancing, energy consumption, security and performance of cloud etc. Future prospect of cloud computing convinced and motivated us to do research on cloud computing framework which uses cloudlet as a service provider. So in the existing framework for mobile cloudlet center, we find three main problems. First problem is that the existing framework does not have concrete mechanism to consider the feedback given to the cloudlet for the task they performed for various other mobile devices. Second problem is that there is no method or framework available which can fetch dynamic parameter of mobile devices and manipulate the information for evaluation of the performance of cloudlets and potential mobile devices which applies to work as cloudlet. Third and the last problem says that there is no measure by which root server can decide whether to scale up or scale down the cloud–cloudlet system. In the proposed model, we have considered the feedback sent by the mobile device and stored it in a directory maintained by the root server at cloud. The root server refers this directory while allocating the task to cloudlets. For the second problem we have used the Gabriel architecture and crowd sensing framework collectively. The combination of these two quite efficiently processes the sensed information at the local level and passes the processed information to root server for decision making. For the last problem we have proposed metrics of yield factor for various parameters which will be calculated by the root server and based on those yield factor values root server can decide whether to scale up the cloud–cloudlet system or not. The proposed scalable key-parameter yield of resources model executed all three solutions on Cloudsim simulator and the results for various parameters are compared with the existing framework of mobile cloudlet center system. These comparisons clearly depict the better performance of our proposed scalable key-parameter yield of resources model over existing framework.","['Rakesh Kumar', 'Santosh Kumar Yadav']",8e722c27-53aa-4624-b7b4-13aafde1c96d,0,"['028d06bb-478f-4ec3-9efb-67268445f28e', '09b234e9-fa30-4ae5-af4d-585dfece4e47', '208391e3-1b91-459c-98cf-f6b7e64236b3', '20b79c91-8b53-4419-ba75-665d92e93363', '2c6f655b-3a03-4414-9330-1d3b9e8792fe', '357c2396-7d81-4cc6-9fa2-0a9e66dc28e4', '370b57cf-c71c-4c33-932b-9e3b08272d6a', '73056048-ca89-4ccf-b281-f173c6557c9c', '74101d4b-985d-464e-85c2-b6fb1f96e964', '7b6864a6-dd5c-48c6-8729-0b192c405c92', '83da4728-c6b6-4df2-9862-e4a0f909c8d2', '8b955403-5e25-41ca-a159-c83725a4c2f3', '8effefae-e10e-4bc0-b814-c386b144cdef', '907c39f3-c788-49de-8fa0-9cee4cf842c6', '97dccc0c-0e40-4da2-8b6c-54d82fdccd71', '9e86f71d-bba9-48e4-8516-a0d65442390a', 'a2090f67-bfd9-4aba-87e5-0a329994c139', 'a934f446-6e22-49d3-8675-22f7fcf5a7ca', 'b4ca9e3f-d878-430d-a354-aa1731291b73', 'ba05bf66-756a-4485-931a-c0e60505819e', 'bfd6d64b-6767-425c-8130-fbcf066d91b4', 'cd91db9a-b744-42e9-a361-6bfaeb291dcd', 'de42b57c-d504-4226-9580-d0da7a663d9c', 'fc806ad3-de2a-4dad-8a2b-820da905c5c6']",Scalable Key Parameter Yield of Resources Model for Performance Enhancement in Mobile Cloud Computing,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
417,"As a convenient and economical data storage solution, cloud storage has been widely adopted in recent years. For cloud storage users, how to guarantee data integrity is one of the biggest concerns. Remote data possession checking schemes are proposed to address this problem. Nonetheless, the existing approaches do not consider the privacy of authenticators, which sometimes may bring financial loss to users. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm named remote data possession checking with privacy-preserving authenticators for cloud storage. In this new paradigm, both cloud service provider and the public verifier do not have access to the real authenticators (signatures) for cloud data. Meanwhile, the integrity of cloud data is still able to be efficiently checked. It is potentially useful in some special situations where electronic checks and contracts are outsourced. To securely protect the privacy of the authenticator, we design a new authenticator called Homomorphic Invisible Authenticator (HIA), which protects the privacy of authenticator and supports the blockless verification. Based on HIA, we construct the first remote data possession checking scheme with privacy-preserving authenticators for cloud storage. To evaluate the security and efficiency of our proposed scheme, we conduct both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. The results show that our proposed paradigm is secure and efficient.","['Wenting Shen', 'Guangyang Yang', 'Jia Yu', 'Hanlin Zhang', 'Fanyu Kong', 'Rong Hao']",facaa494-7741-4add-839a-9defc11afa71,0,"['45b503c5-179d-4d14-ba2f-73ebb9dffd26', '4a382a95-e658-42ef-a355-6c8d26d12a50', '4feece5b-4bb8-49a4-baa3-a6157fc20ce2', '5ab187db-02bf-4239-9fb7-3630469e1369', '5bb35582-4cdc-448f-bf52-b08c519dfe87', '6066a24d-8826-422b-a595-450bfa6e90e4', '625967b0-8de6-4097-9285-526e1257beb7', '7725821a-44c5-4889-9359-704c02326361', '8e24efc2-9343-46cb-9d62-6482f4dab9eb', '97467bcc-67d8-4a96-bc26-0c7afe1cf9fa', 'be4b0791-e374-405a-a320-1d6656c2e829', 'c39cce90-b955-4105-9791-7c758f2082a7', 'c7d6aaef-37a6-47b4-a318-5a94a516f684', 'd3dec473-526b-4860-bd50-486d60650fdc', 'dd1e52bc-ebf4-4da5-ac40-29c091d454c9', 'df2fe4ea-0c12-453d-99fc-b4143b264f4d', 'e26009a0-1e86-4459-bb68-0e027da16332', 'e81a613e-ff3c-48a1-aff1-02935663643e', 'fcfbe0f0-dea2-496f-9cb2-cd740c00274b']",Remote data possession checking with privacy-preserving authenticators for cloud storage,Future Generation Computer Systems,2017

420,"Background and Objectives#R##N#The main pathologic feature of asthma is episodic airway obstruction. This is usually detected by spirometry and body plethysmography. These tests, however, require a high degree of collaboration and maximal effort on the part of the patient. There is agreement in the literature that there is a demand of research into new technologies to improve non-invasive testing of lung function. The purpose of this study was to develop automatic classifiers to simplify the clinical use and to increase the accuracy of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) in the diagnosis of airway obstruction in patients with asthma.#R##N#Methods#R##N#The data consisted of FOT parameters obtained from 75 volunteers (39 with obstruction and 36 without). Different supervised machine learning (ML) techniques were investigated, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), AdaBoost with decision trees (ADAB) and feature-based dissimilarity space classifier (FDSC).#R##N#Results#R##N#The first part of this study showed that the best FOT parameter was the resonance frequency (AUC = 0.81), which indicates moderate accuracy (0.70–0.90). In the second part of this study, the use of the cited ML techniques was investigated. All the classifiers improved the diagnostic accuracy. Notably, ADAB and KNN were very close to achieving high accuracy (AUC = 0.88 and 0.89, respectively). Experiments including the cross products of the FOT parameters showed that all the classifiers improved the diagnosis accuracy and KNN was able to reach a higher accuracy range (AUC = 0.91).#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#Machine learning classifiers can help in the diagnosis of airway obstruction in asthma patients, and they can assist clinicians in airway obstruction identification.","['Jorge L.

421,"On-chip interconnects are the performance bottleneck in modern system-on-chips. Code-division multiple access (CDMA) has been proposed to implement on-chip crossbars due to its fixed latency, reduced arbitration overhead, and higher bandwidth. In CDMA, medium sharing is enabled in the code space by assigning a limited number of    ${N},$   -chip length orthogonal spreading codes to the processing elements sharing the interconnect. In this paper, we advance overloaded CDMA interconnect (OCI) to enhance the capacity of CDMA network-on-chip (NoC) crossbars by increasing the number of usable spreading codes. Serial and parallel OCI architecture variants are presented to adhere to different area, delay, and power requirements. Compared with the conventional CDMA crossbar, on a Xilinx Artix-7 AC701 FPGA kit, the serial OCI crossbar achieves 100% higher bandwidth, 31% less resource utilization, and 45% power saving, while the parallel OCI crossbar achieves    ${N},$    times higher bandwidth compared with the serial OCI crossbar at the expense of increased area and power consumption. A 65-node OCI-based star NoC is implemented, evaluated, and compared with an equivalent space division multiple access based torus NoC for various synthetic traffic patterns. The evaluation results in terms of the resource utilization and throughput highlight the OCI as a promising technology to implement the physical layer of NoC routers.","['Khaled E.

422,"Along with the surge in mobile data, dense small cell network has become an effective method to improve system capacity and spectrum efficiency. However, because more small cells are deployed, the interference among dense small cells exacerbates. It also makes frequent handover for mobile users (UEs), which brings a great deal of signaling overhead to the core network. In order to solve the problems of interference and frequent handover, a novel clustering scheme for dense small cell network is proposed in this paper. The scheme is based on the weighted graph. First, we present a dense small cell clustering model based on X2 interface to minimize core network signaling overhead. To improve the usability of the model, we model the system as an undirected weighted graph. Then we propose the maximum benefit merging algorithm to reduce the complexity. This method enables adjacent small cells to cooperate and form virtual cellular cluster according to handover statistics information. Then we select cluster head (CH) according to certain rule in each cluster. Cluster head acts as the mobility anchor, managing the handovers between cluster members. This can reduce core network signaling overhead and the interference among small cells effectively. Compared with the 3GPP handover algorithm, the proposed clustering model in this paper can reduce the signaling overhead more than 70%. The simulation results show that the proposed clustering model can effectively cluster the dense small cell.","['Ying-ying Li', 'Zhonggui Ma', 'Wen-bo Yan', 'Liyu Liu']",ea133e7b-b4a1-4a1f-a64b-d64bb259c82c,0,"['13efc4cb-3f27-44a7-9565-4ac5960122f5', '1926956b-f99d-42bd-9a98-44d3c7e4d8f3', '356f311a-cb87-4bf0-9ed4-eb3cccb63a69', '706cb746-be85-4da8-bbb7-fc6e2cf03dd6', '735e74a6-9c17-4286-a3b5-721fd99189e9', '78eae0f4-b793-4689-ba14-be56d44262b3', '857cf162-64c0-4de7-8555-c999288021c6', 'a678ac3b-a044-4c0c-97cb-533d50bac443', 'aad0fe1e-e3fb-4953-94e8-7c8d21161c12', 'b42710ab-0083-4b7b-bd08-cb510e8a2a42', 'c688eb3c-3fad-48aa-b37a-8cd818827d3c', 'c6d8c7ef-065e-4f0d-8a92-357b9474eced', 'c7a7a114-cf2d-4269-bd4f-a2005ec0b53e', 'e04e1268-5e32-449c-92c0-894c416088f9', 'e1bfd818-5d58-4113-920f-7e40d5715f9d', 'f70b255a-a40f-4aa8-8d03-c6e1ba786cab']",Weighted Graph Based Clustering and Local Mobility Management for Dense Small Cell Network with X2 Interface,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
423,"One of the important problems in heterogeneous computing systems is task scheduling. The task scheduling problem intends to assigns tasks to a number of processors in a manner that will optimize the overall performance of the system, i.e. minimizing execution time or maximizing parallelization in assigning the tasks to the processors. The task scheduling problem is an NP-complete and this is why the algorithms applied to this problem are heuristic or meta-heuristic by which we could reach a relatively optimal solution. This paper presents a genetic-based algorithm as a meta-heuristic method to address static task scheduling for processors in heterogeneous computing systems. The algorithm improves the performance of genetic algorithm through significant changes in its genetic functions and introduction of new operators that guarantee sample variety and consistent coverage of the whole space. Moreover, the random initial population has been replaced with some initial populations with relatively optimized solutions to lower repetitions in the genetic algorithm. The results of running this algorithm on the graphs of real-world applications and random graphs in heterogeneous computing systems with a wide range of characteristics, indicated significant improvements of efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared with other task scheduling algorithms.","['Mehdi Akbari', 'Hassan Rashidi', 'Sasan H.

This paper proposes a novel Heuristic Algorithm for Clustering Hierarchy ( HACH ), which sequentially performs selection of inactive nodes and cluster head nodes at every round. Inactive node selection employs a stochastic sleep scheduling mechanism to determine the selection of nodes that can be put into sleep mode without adversely affecting network coverage. Also, the clustering algorithm uses a novel heuristic crossover operator to combine two different solutions to achieve an improved solution that enhances the distribution of cluster head nodes and coordinates energy consumption in WSNs. The proposed algorithm is evaluated via simulation experiments and compared with some existing algorithms. Our protocol shows improved performance in terms of extended lifetime and maintains favourable performances even under different energy heterogeneity settings.","['Muyiwa Olakanmi Oladimeji', 'Mikdam Turkey', 'Sandra E.

426,"Optimal control of water flooding reservoir is performed to calculate the optimal set of well controls to maximize economic profitability. However, calculating the optimal well controls requires major computational resources, which restricts its implementation in actual reservoir production. In this paper a reduced-order optimal control methodology mainly based on POD (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition) is proposed to optimize the operation of wells in water flooding reservoir. The methodology is decomposed into the ‘offline’ and ‘online’ calculations. The offline calculation consists in determining a reduced set of POD basis from several ‘snapshots’ obtained using reservoir simulator over a pre-determined set of time instants and well control parameters. In the online calculation, knowing the current economic parameters, the optimal well controls are determined only using a nonlinear programming method and POD reconstruction. The methodology is approved on a small scale, two-dimensional, water flooding reservoir model. The results show that the NPV obtained by the reduced-order optimal control methodology is approached to within 99% of the NPV obtained by the adjoint-gradient based methodology, besides, it is quite fast, where the achieved increase in calculation speed is several dozens of times, and its advantage of calculation speed significantly increases as the number of grid blocks increases.","['X.Y.

427,"This paper proposes a parallelized online optimization of low voltage distribution network (LVDN) operation. It is performed on a graphics processing unit (GPU) by combining the optimization procedure with the load flow method. In the case study, performed for the test LVDN with distributed generators (DGs) and controllable loads, differential evolution optimization based on a backward–forward sweep load flow method was parallelized on GPU. The goal of online optimization is to keep the LVDN voltage profile within the prescribed limits, to minimize LVDN losses, and to enable demand response functionality. This is achieved by the optimization determined reference values for the controllable load’s operation, and the reactive power generation, and active power curtailment of DGs. The results show that the parallelized GPU implemented optimization can be significantly faster than similar implementation on a central processing unit, and is, therefore, suitable for the online optimization of the presented LVDN.","['Ernest Belič', 'Niko Lukač', 'Klemen Dezelak', 'Borut Zalik', 'Gorazd Stumberger']",0fe53f07-6536-42fa-84d2-3493b71556ad,0,"['28bd4886-6c02-4429-bf22-3b3a863aa4cb', '54d5b75e-b83a-4261-9d46-198bdeeea9d6', '6c3b2f8f-3e02-423c-8064-5f0223a19115', '7c471bdf-ebc1-4415-a91b-872386131b42', '8dffc0a5-9624-464c-81fb-da76f32a35a6', 'a3bb4804-2334-45ba-bf1b-d84a0caa5dbe', 'aa5b6474-b240-4bf6-9dec-4f8c4b7674e7', 'b93f4b29-1d96-4d59-b5fa-a444ceba6515', 'd0ccc423-fb11-4721-b189-4e7f296487c4', 'e7a8d4df-dec6-4082-a67b-253eb7ad6a78', 'e9d721cb-9128-406f-b742-900e480df537', 'f168795d-b243-43a5-bc0f-c3b78b2b9a54']",GPU-Based Online Optimization of Low Voltage Distribution Network Operation,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2017
428,"Operational researchers, risk and decision analysts need consider many behavioural issues. Despite many OR applications in nuclear emergency decision support, the literature has not paid sufficient attention to behavioural matters. In working on designing decision support processes for nuclear emergency management, we have encountered many behavioural issues. In this paper we synthesise the findings in the literature with our experience and identify a number of behavioural challenges to nuclear emergency decision support. In addition to challenges in model-building and interaction, we pay attention to a behavioural issue that is often neglected: the analysis itself and the communication of its implications may have behavioural consequences. We introduce proposals to address these challenges. First, we propose the use of models relying on incomplete preference information, outlining a framework and illustrating it with data from a previous decision analysis for the Chernobyl Project. Moreover, we reflect on the responsibility that rests on the analyst in addressing behavioural issues sensitively in order to lessen the effects on public stress. In doing so we make a distinction between System 1 Societal Deliberation and System 2 Societal Deliberation and discuss how this can help structure societal deliberation in the context of nuclear emergencies.","['Nikolaos Argyris', 'Simon French']",5e6f65f8-90eb-41d6-a028-cf67d9e73668,0,"['08b9967d-0244-40d7-ac51-822c03e33d67', '0af77dee-a672-4050-84ab-02f364d8dd82', '287e187e-6aa7-4932-9c6a-7bb0e4acad66', '2c5c15ff-0bde-4a4e-8161-2dae71312c9d', '39264b4b-146d-4835-b161-3f3cc440af53', '416dd5db-2c6f-44a1-bab6-38e7d0ab24b0', '5521c2f0-969e-489f-befc-3730a6e0d9bf', '552207a6-ec27-4de5-a8ac-fe836be10588', '5813934f-e737-4dcd-ae85-fe12887dae49', '7cf15fe4-0b1c-4646-a217-1a6b09d06f7c', 'a1023b4f-9e3f-4a55-bf6f-eadf0a6f97e7', 'af438817-1b22-4ccc-81f1-6c73675c7726', 'b8d85a2e-fef5-4fd9-af2a-10736b96d076', 'bc5f0d69-7b4f-4eaa-85e7-f6e31bc7fabc', 'dc96937a-d147-477c-88a9-0244460548a0', 'df940f2e-c3ad-4164-b142-7eb198170b51', 'e1a805c6-cb7b-4152-874f-e5779029f224', 'e3e21d4a-6488-4474-ae4e-dee938fefffd', 'ee85a2e2-5654-4417-8a2e-5ddc39610929', 'faa8a1f2-d51d-42be-b0e7-50efc867a15a']",Nuclear emergency decision support: a behavioural OR perspective,European Journal of Operational Research,2017

Connected-component labeling is indispensable for distinguishing different objects in a binary image, and prerequisite for image analysis and object recognition in the image. Therefore, connected-component labeling is one of the most important processes for image analysis, image understanding, pattern recognition, and computer vision.

Results from a between-subjects experiment (N = 160) indicate that large screens positively influence information quality by simultaneously increasing both the hedonic and pragmatic qualities of smartwatches. However, the effects of round screens on information quality are mediated only by the hedonic quality, suggesting that square screens are more closely associated with the pragmatic, rather than hedonic, quality of the medium. The results also reveal that the effects of screen shape and screen size are moderated by the presentation mode (text + image vs. text only) of information.",['Ki Joon Kim'],63d4d97c-24af-41c2-a3d5-a25b705112ee,0,"['43e10c63-9079-409b-884e-a3b6ebd145be', '45280f0e-359c-407d-a996-ac00f7fc63cb', '5f564655-f311-400c-a1eb-a6979ba8450f', '91e629c6-b32b-4826-b2c3-a9bee330a8c7', '93c06271-2330-4a7e-ae28-79bbfdfe39ac', '9a599be4-5a6d-42f7-aa4f-9b921cb50f97', '9da217ba-4027-465a-9b62-c938a26c236f', 'bbd547c0-0cac-4f94-acbf-611832cffe82', 'd178e012-a5b6-450a-b7e3-bd510704e49c', 'ef4c214d-31f1-45c1-9dfd-db1c8268ba16', 'fa86f25f-b6b9-45ec-a334-067a44e86239']","Shape and Size Matter for Smartwatches: Effects of Screen Shape, Screen Size, and Presentation Mode in Wearable Communication",Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,2017
431,"In this paper, we propose a new aperiodic formulation of model predictive control for nonlinear continuous-time systems. Unlike earlier approaches, we provide event-triggered conditions  without  using the optimal cost as a Lyapunov function candidate. Instead, we evaluate the time interval when the optimal state trajectory enters a local set around the origin. The obtained event-triggered strategy is more suitable for practical applications than the earlier approaches in two directions. First, it does not include parameters (e.g., Lipschitz constant parameters of stage and terminal costs) which may be a potential source of conservativeness for the event-triggered conditions. Second, the event-triggered conditions are necessary to be checked only at certain sampling time instants, instead of continuously. This leads to the alleviation of the sensing cost and becomes more suitable for practical implementations under a digital platform. The proposed event-triggered scheme is also validated through numerical simulations.","['Kazumune Hashimoto', 'Shuichi Adachi', 'Dimos V.

We present an algorithm for overcrowding detection based on passive Wi-Fi requests capture and a platform for event monitoring that integrates this algorithm. The platform offers access control management, attendees monitoring and the analysis and visualization of the captured information, using a scalable software architecture. In this paper, we evaluate the algorithm in two ways: First, we test its accuracy with data captured in a real event, and then we analyze the scalability of the code in a multi-core Apache Spark-based environment.

433,"Data clustering is a necessary process in many scientific disciplines, and fuzzy c-means (FCM) is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. Recently, distributing weight values and avoiding local minimization are the possible ways to improve the results of FCM. In this paper, fuzzy C-means clustering based on weights and gene expression programming (WGFCM) is proposed to improve the performance of FCM. A new weight vectors calculation based on entropy is introduced to measure distance accurately. Moreover, gene expression programming (GEP) is employed to determine the appropriate cluster centers. Experiments are conducted with ten UCI data sets to compare the proposed method with FCM. In addition, WGFCM is compared with other FCM based methods and different clustering approaches published for a fair assessment. The results show that the proposed method is far superior to FCM-based methods in terms of purity, Rand Index, accuracy rate, objective function value and iterative cost. Moreover, it has an advantage over other clustering approaches in terms of the accuracy.","['Zhaohui Jiang', 'Tingting Li', 'Wenfang Min', 'Zhao Qi', 'Yuan Rao']",f5e43a11-ee21-4514-9754-19953dce3e69,0,"['00b6ebc1-cb9e-4182-9022-9a5a7ab59401', '1100276c-8977-4876-8bc6-ed1aa145290e', '1473df46-b035-4aac-bcb9-c2ed9fca640a', '1fff95dd-8316-4e00-851a-8d6a96960d1d', '201856df-93d7-496e-9dcb-f59aa4ee5561', '28388384-4255-4576-8053-ae42adbf4ed4', '28c6a5a6-35b1-4fef-95f3-2f398fc2f2d9', '28e5d215-466d-4f4e-8100-e352a3050e16', '2af11154-307d-4706-b9fc-4deb625c4186', '30035d22-4dea-44e6-a031-41f768dfcfdf', '35bdd13f-00e1-4f3a-9040-cb930450792f', '3c0e1489-3990-4c25-9cb0-e17603fc260f', '6d45f52a-615c-4f31-9fe4-9b1ddfcee24e', '6f2d413c-1a51-4198-9519-aba9b27e0c69', '7ab2b2df-97af-4ce6-b3db-1fd257516af0', '7b57db11-7c4d-4d1e-aa62-3a5d7d1f7987', '8dcfec51-2464-4ef4-92f5-76eaa04b1546', '8f436e6b-60a9-41be-b5e6-dc97c8d4e067', '91c44d64-b62b-44bf-b284-86f90737d0ee', 'b4dd5f65-93bf-4c6e-87dd-535497231246', 'c20766ad-be36-4af7-a821-b2aa2588411f', 'c79db06c-8a2f-476d-a1de-62832a37b9ec', 'cfff133e-b0ae-4098-bc35-d520f41dede5', 'd3b19844-545d-47e5-8c8f-28525ebe957f', 'db279616-bd1b-49a4-8f2c-28532149abf7', 'e069dca0-8d7a-4f69-85b3-b715c71d4164', 'f9dd47eb-fb4f-4fff-8de9-689fa5410097']",Fuzzy c-means clustering based on weights and gene expression programming,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017
434,"In 1998, Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin introduced identifying codes to model fault diagnosis in multiprocessor systems (Karpovsky et al., 1998). In these codes, each vertex is identified by the vertices belonging to the code in its neighborhood. There exists a coloring variant as follows: a globally identifying coloring of a graph is a coloring such that each vertex is identified by the colors in its neighborhood.

435,"In this letter, a new spectrum-oriented fast factorized backprojection (FFBP) algorithm is proposed for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging on a maneuvering platform. Specifically, an analytical SAR image spectrum is derived in a novel quasi-polar coordinate system based on the FFBP, which makes it easy to incorporate with an autocalibration process for both systematic and nonsystematic errors. Different from the conventional FFBP algorithms developed in polar grid, the proposed algorithm devised in quasi-polar gird conducts the motion-induced phase error as a space-invariant component, which will definitely facilitate the phase autofocusing process during the FFBP recursions. Subsequently, a phase autofocusing process is incorporated in the resultant SAR image formation algorithm. Simulations and discussions are presented to show the focusing quality improvement made by the proposed algorithm.","['Lei Yang', 'Lifan Zhao', 'Song Zhou', 'Guoan Bi', 'Huan Yang']",520fc0e0-6147-446b-a56a-da2b4c440439,0,"['2a9a3d1d-5cfb-46f8-a7e7-955b3636af97', '58ed9d4f-efd7-48f9-8967-323627ff366d', '5f3be082-618f-4514-81f5-a7eacc676e92', '9e756ffc-110f-43f7-8830-5f2c42a10fb7', 'c58ec070-ec50-46a5-89ec-1922dd7d3913', 'c5f84f85-d778-4c07-adf3-75e55de30bf9', 'c76b590f-d848-4754-8afd-2775e561f081', 'eed79338-c531-41ca-bbf0-4b2d4dcb1f69', 'fba0f287-9288-4f71-be25-20185f1d1e3e']",Spectrum-Oriented FFBP Algorithm in Quasi-Polar Grid for SAR Imaging on Maneuvering Platform,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
436,"Here we comment on the article, “On the mapping of genotype to phenotype in evolutionary algorithms”, by Peter A. Whigham, Grant Dick, and James Maclaurin. The authors present a critical view on the use of genotype to phenotype mapping in Evolutionary Algorithms, and how the use of this analogy can be detrimental for problem solving. They examine a grammar-based approach to Genetic Programming (GP), Grammatical Evolution (GE), and highlight properties of GE which are detrimental to effective evolutionary search. Rather than use loose analogies and methaphors, we suggest that a focus should be (and has been in GE and other approaches to GP) on addressing one of the most significant open issues in our field, i.e., What are the sufficient set of features in natural, genetic, evolutionary and developmental systems, which can translate into the most effective computational approaches for program synthesis?","['Michael O’Neill', 'Miguel Nicolau']",e2867697-e5fb-45eb-8787-67d8212eca25,50,"['05812604-72b4-47ef-9c66-112d961fcf3e', '1f94ba77-218d-4609-a693-5e36941bda98', '22db832d-7979-4207-bcd1-bbd050900822', '2fca5140-3dbf-41f8-a7ce-6642b2b4cca6', '407bc367-b654-487a-9ac1-cd7c0faf4939', '4e08ba4f-3eaf-48e9-abad-ead2fa7926cd', '573e3568-a92f-4e5b-a988-eae34d9c5758', '59e2e99d-3deb-48ce-bdca-76b772251606', '60ac6dd4-4e7a-492b-86ac-0c6d79e39a8b', '826dad2c-d328-47bc-bd99-7943c1b60b73', '86ab7374-21c9-4d0e-8833-c247a2e629ba', 'ae5edc83-e69f-4773-8436-549933f67c91', 'b6c2105f-f6bb-4550-9cc7-8d933e429120', 'c2c9f32b-090a-4fb9-8da7-b53f0ec82cdb']","Distilling the salient features of natural systems: Commentary on “On the mapping of genotype to phenotype in evolutionary algorithms” by Whigham, Dick and Maclaurin",Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines,2017
437,"The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite, unlike its predecessor Terra MODIS, had always been thought to have been spared from significant deleterious impacts of electronic crosstalk on its imagery. However, recent efforts brought to our attention the presence of striping artifacts in Aqua MODIS images from band 24 (   $4.47~\mu \text{m},$   ), which upon further inspection proved to have a noticeable impact on the quality of the L1B product and to have been present since the beginning of the mission, in 2002. Using images of the moon from scheduled lunar observations, we linked the artifacts with electronic crosstalk contamination of the response of detector 1 of band 24 by signal sent from the detector 10 of band 26 (   $1.375~\mu \text{m},$   ), a neighboring band in the same focal plane assembly. In this letter, we report on these findings, the artifact mitigation strategy adopted by us, and on our success in restoring band 24 detector 1 behavior and image quality.","['Graziela R.

438,"In this research, we investigate the numerical solution of nonlinear Schrodinger equations in two and three dimensions. The numerical meshless method which will be used here is RBF-FD technique. The main advantage of this method is the approximation of the required derivatives based on finite difference technique at each local-support domain as   Ω i        Ω    i         . At each   Ω i        Ω    i         , we require to solve a small linear system of algebraic equations with a conditionally positive definite matrix of order   1     1        (interpolation matrix). This scheme is efficient and its computational cost is same as the moving least squares approximation. A challengeable issue is choosing suitable shape parameter for interpolation matrix in this way. In order to overcome this matter, an algorithm which was established by Sarra   [1]  , will be applied. This algorithm computes the condition number of the local interpolation matrix using the singular value decomposition (SVD) for obtaining the smallest and largest singular values of that matrix. Moreover, an explicit method based on Runge–Kutta formula of fourth-order accuracy will be applied for approximating the time variable. It also decreases the computational costs at each time step since we will not solve a nonlinear system. On the other hand, to compare RBF-FD method with another meshless technique, the moving kriging least squares (MKLS) approximation is considered for the studied model. Our results demonstrate the ability of the present approach for solving the applicable model which is investigated in the current research work.","['Mehdi Dehghan', 'Vahid Mohammadi']",f575dde2-1b24-43e1-abaf-dcd044e13520,0,"['017ebfbb-4029-4812-b1f8-94cff6537ce5', '26281796-a62d-441c-bcff-53264e500961', '2d70ddb6-3821-4524-befe-99c8da8dc2b8', '33da7bcf-6877-4242-b4d9-44dad3b24da4', '366c7592-5fb8-4cb8-bea7-b2f3cb867a66', '39d2bf06-50e3-4997-8862-f4ebd814fc45', '51d831bc-643a-4d80-ae01-c6091dcac3af', '666382ec-2ec7-4a64-9214-5d62ca135ed2', '7bffbb6d-549f-48d0-86c4-d983281802a7', '8381b314-7fe5-43aa-9281-d7fac5c46c34', '8a84a0a3-e4a3-4aba-a6c8-fcd65073ee0b', '9f1563bd-9619-456d-851e-07a2a205c4dd', 'a0c1082b-9f93-4bce-a1a1-3b04d333f354', 'a245169d-d06b-41e1-9fdf-27122b08e430', 'abc9862a-2fae-42d8-99c3-9c95af1e5f58', 'e0c29ee5-2fcc-4808-9357-cac25b3a98b4', 'e87c2b57-736c-4a80-a5a3-f6f2f32ca461', 'ec786ff0-2742-477f-814a-d137d7b82ed3', 'fbe80b9e-1a69-4bdf-9631-20440546f714']",A numerical scheme based on radial basis function finite difference (RBF-FD) technique for solving the high-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equations using an explicit time discretization: Runge–Kutta method,Computer Physics Communications,2017
439,"Insecticide resistance is a major challenge for the control program of insect pests in the fields of crop protection, human and animal health etc. Resistance to different insecticides is conferred by the proteins encoded from certain class of genes of the insects. To distinguish the insecticide resistant proteins from non-resistant proteins, no computational tool is available till date. Thus, development of such a computational tool will be helpful in predicting the insecticide resistant proteins, which can be targeted for developing appropriate insecticides. Five different sets of feature viz., amino acid composition (AAC), di-peptide composition (DPC), pseudo amino acid composition (PAAC), composition-transition-distribution (CTD) and auto-correlation function (ACF) were used to map the protein sequences into numeric feature vectors. The encoded numeric vectors were then used as input in support vector machine (SVM) for classification of insecticide resistant and non-resistant proteins. Higher accuracies were obtained under RBF kernel than that of other kernels. Further, accuracies were observed to be higher for DPC feature set as compared to others. The proposed approach achieved an overall accuracy of >90% in discriminating resistant from non-resistant proteins. Further, the two classes of resistant proteins i.e., detoxification-based and target-based were discriminated from non-resistant proteins with >95% accuracy. Besides, >95% accuracy was also observed for discrimination of proteins involved in detoxification- and target-based resistance mechanisms. The proposed approach not only outperformed Blastp, PSI-Blast and Delta-Blast algorithms, but also achieved >92% accuracy while assessed using an independent dataset of 75 insecticide resistant proteins. This paper presents the first computational approach for discriminating the insecticide resistant proteins from non-resistant proteins. Based on the proposed approach, an online prediction server DIRProt has also been developed for computational prediction of insecticide resistant proteins, which is accessible at #N#                    http://cabgrid.res.in:8080/dirprot/#N#                    #N#                  . The proposed approach is believed to supplement the efforts needed to develop dynamic insecticides in wet-lab by targeting the insecticide resistant proteins.","['Prabina Kumar Meher', 'Tanmaya Kumar Sahu', 'Anjali Banchariya', 'Atmakuri Ramakrishna Rao']",c1e1ef56-6eda-4ef9-9b1e-8d62d1f9ffb0,0,"['1d6845c6-57e0-415d-9ebf-bfea22345e5a', '294dfed2-6380-4c43-ab59-a5040fcb65ac', '2d1e8e0a-ccbe-4d9b-82d2-685c6051c787', '3807b6e3-53df-409c-95a2-d850fed24cbb', '43fe8ddc-ec99-4bfe-9447-2bd038997467', '634e1979-c0d9-4c31-97df-7cb576762197', '711ca4a9-964d-4156-9a2f-fe51e03bd403', '7a7c55ed-0163-407f-94ca-bf33d6a8510a', 'aa4f2bb4-f5e9-4b86-adc0-af77f400d443', 'c87293a3-25f2-473b-9b13-1b37d871c754']",DIRProt: a computational approach for discriminating insecticide resistant proteins from non-resistant proteins,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
440,"As a well-known stochastic optimization algorithm, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has attracted the attention of many researchers all over the world, which has resulted in many variants of the basic algorithm, in addition to a vast number of parameter selection/control strategies. However, most of these algorithms evolve their population using a single fixed pattern, thereby reducing the intelligence of the entire swarm. Some PSO-variants adopt a multimode evolutionary strategy, but lack dynamic adaptability. Furthermore, competition among particles is ignored, with no consideration of individual thinking or decision-making ability. This paper introduces an evolution mechanism based on individual difference, and proposes a novel improved PSO algorithm based on individual difference evolution (IDE-PSO). This algorithm allocates a competition coefficient called the emotional status to each particle for quantifying individual differences, separates the entire swarm into three subgroups, and selects the specific evolutionary method for each particle according to its emotional status and current fitness. The value of the coefficient is adjusted dynamically according to the evolutionary performance of each particle. A modified restarting strategy is employed to regenerate corresponding particles and enhance the diversity of the population. For a series of benchmark functions, simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed IDE-PSO, which outperforms many state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in terms of convergence, robustness, and scalability.","['Jin Gou', 'Yu-Xiang Lei', 'Wang-Ping Guo', 'Cheng Wang', 'Yiqiao Cai', 'Wei Luo']",23e49558-bb77-41d8-99c9-1d3e2d79988f,0,"['090cdb69-8897-40c6-af05-4a5f45e2659f', '0a2bbf53-3377-4041-b425-6c85868c2042', '168b1b0c-be02-45ab-815e-770e8e005877', '1d8a7f8f-d6b9-45f8-ae10-0db5bf2e890b', '27ac8b3a-dc69-4f19-9159-e94ae7891956', '2ab7414f-4327-4539-902c-6be86947d1fb', '2bd582da-4223-43e4-af69-48046f07ed3d', '2e091ecf-0052-42d9-a1ac-0d29311c143a', '36dc3fd3-6f51-4b5e-82e8-c106835ea715', '38ab1a7d-2f43-4a79-ab86-e5d1bfa4dc15', '38ccb2c4-49da-4c42-baa4-ae84793185c7', '4465b710-facf-4670-b565-0c702f4a13f0', '48713537-faad-42f4-9af5-e8be77710932', '49d65e50-cc9b-4d90-ad6b-974ace3e2ec1', '4e0e475f-4f6a-4774-aec5-c95028296765', '5131173c-8195-44e3-bc95-1043b04ff531', '59a1d971-8fb0-41d4-9a3e-60fcb018459e', '59b76c20-620e-4eed-93e6-6f970545609f', '5a8c5b29-8366-4468-baf2-c673d5bf0950', '5d247d2e-e0f2-4307-a7bd-c696a928b1fa', '5f8df029-c993-4342-8122-ede26241f780', '63a830b4-c809-43f5-94a5-8f0992673f9a', '68bc996c-eb37-4ada-b773-484acc01bdc9', '69484ce7-0ae5-4f2f-b1e9-ad1e770dbe56', '71ee593d-46e1-4393-9ce6-ee8bc5558e24', '752fc5f1-aa35-4dcc-9398-c82328151781', '7711f1b3-f593-49da-bb5c-a4c3fe97dd34', '7fa9d611-dad6-4fa9-a192-0b628a4f296a', '8099a942-0e05-4755-a7ea-8d175136303c', '82fe5352-300f-4575-9073-4f5d1c9cda2c', '95d5bceb-78c0-47b6-81a9-81b741d86181', '96e00c15-a162-4cf7-9abd-0798f293b846', '9e80b365-896a-4c73-8083-e4d97c3fd1d9', 'a37845d6-1b5f-4b69-9f02-27fc65b2e6aa', 'abc11499-ed4b-49c1-bc33-bfde7eaecd32', 'ae4ef773-9b96-4878-8cbb-872c2be2ff4c', 'b914a5dc-a951-41db-8cd8-61b1c4778aad', 'c85f20da-cf3f-4893-b6dc-923000e690d8', 'cbfec9aa-38d1-46be-89ec-ebd672433890', 'cd771f54-e9b9-44cb-90c0-2d1c60bef92f', 'd0988b68-342e-4c3a-aff8-69be59a747aa', 'deffe8c1-8079-4aba-a4e0-5676bf642f9a', 'e177217b-08f1-479c-bf5f-b07fed383a4f', 'e39a5b5a-7241-4a4b-9be5-15b94b72c20e', 'e4b468aa-2b23-4229-8872-f9286464a19f', 'ea3ed055-a6e8-47f0-81ef-34e7d53dc393', 'f1a8ec86-3642-4048-92d9-00679d956af6', 'f37f3daf-3445-407c-9e38-00c67587735f', 'f5cc526f-6cd4-401e-aac1-416ac15aa146', 'fedd688e-442e-40fe-a385-7a425ceb964d']",A novel improved particle swarm optimization algorithm based on individual difference evolution,Applied Soft Computing,2017

442,"LiDAR has been an effective technology for acquiring urban land cover data in recent decades. Previous studies indicate that geometric features have a strong impact on land cover classification. Here, we analyzed an urban LiDAR dataset to explore the optimal feature subset from 25 geometric features incorporating 25 scales under 6 definitions for urban land cover classification. We performed a feature selection strategy to remove irrelevant or redundant features based on the correlation coefficient between features and classification accuracy of each features. The neighborhood scales were divided into small (0.5–1.5 m), medium (1.5–6 m) and large (>6 m) scale. Combining features with lower correlation coefficient and better classification performance would improve classification accuracy. The feature depicting homogeneity or heterogeneity of points would be calculated at a small scale, and the features to smooth points at a medium scale and the features of height different at large scale. As to the neighborhood definition, cuboid and cylinder were recommended. This study can guide the selection of optimal geometric features with adaptive neighborhood scale for urban land cover classification.","['Weihua Dong', 'Jianhang Lan', 'Shunlin Liang', 'Wei Yao', 'Zhicheng Zhan']",a2ab1a99-7386-402b-9760-a83890557d18,0,"['2a0b698a-941b-4a78-9da1-2bd0357ef609', '3976652a-a1da-4298-979e-c1d8d7daeb60', '60cc99db-1078-4f20-a2ab-2f400e527991', '620fd3d6-5273-4104-b13e-64ecc54ced31', '6c2fee35-a596-416a-bd8a-a7966324f71e', '7e6468e2-485c-4716-8d23-83ba572504de', '801d192a-b415-4add-87f7-93e5dc8acf48', 'b1108963-b5f2-46f7-9241-145ceb2a3b5e', 'bd50b483-e4ae-4bff-a4b4-7370904f45ed', 'ea44f0eb-f48b-4220-8a76-12f4f7ff9142', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6']",Selection of LiDAR geometric features with adaptive neighborhood size for urban land cover classification,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2017

In this letter, we present a novel method for light field image super-resolution (SR) to simultaneously up-sample both the spatial and angular resolutions of a light field image via a deep convolutional neural network. We first augment the spatial resolution of each subaperture image by a spatial SR network, then novel views between super-resolved subaperture images are generated by three different angular SR networks according to the novel view locations.

444,"The authors present an interesting method on Normalized Lagrange Multiplier test for network parameter errors identification. The authors state that validation has so far been solely based on extensive simulations. They also state that the paper presents a new framework by which: (1) the normalized Lagrange multiplier test is re-formulated from the perspective of hypothesis testing, enabling proper handling of missing bad parameter cases; (2) formal proofs are given for the combined utilization of normalized Lagrange multiplier test and normalized residual test for simultaneous handling of measurement and parameter errors; and (3) the concepts of detectability and identifiability for measurement errors are extended to parameter errors, and a systematic approach for identifying critical parameters and critical k-tuples is provided.

447,"Spatial sampling is traditionally studied in a static setting where static sensors scattered around space take measurements of the spatial field at their locations. In this paper, we study the emerging paradigm of sampling and reconstructing spatial fields using sensors that move through space. We show that mobile sensing offers some unique advantages over static sensing in sensing bandlimited spatial fields. Since a moving sensor encounters such a spatial field along its path as a time-domain signal, a time-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed prior to sampling the signal received at the sensor. Such a filtering procedure, when used by a configuration of sensors moving at constant speeds along equispaced parallel lines, leads to a complete suppression of spatial aliasing in the direction of motion of the sensors. We analytically quantify the advantage of using such a sampling scheme over a static sampling scheme by computing the reduction in sampling noise due to the filter. We also analyze the effects of nonuniform sensor speeds on the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulation examples, we demonstrate the advantages of mobile sampling over static sampling in practical problems. We extend our analysis to sampling and reconstruction schemes for monitoring time-varying bandlimited fields using mobile sensors. We demonstrate that in some situations we require a lower density of sensors when using a mobile sensing scheme instead of the conventional static sensing scheme. The exact advantage is quantified for a problem of sampling and reconstructing an audio field.","['Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan', 'Martin Vetterli']",c1642bf3-3a95-4815-89bb-afd52370da85,50,"['0b0bd71b-4887-4edb-b9e6-8cf76c5486b9', '1513edba-4877-4b37-ab99-6b91d0c148f0', '1bc98256-c8be-472f-8d87-bcd183e11f68', '221a70c3-3aa2-4511-a89a-6a122282b001', '406627e2-a34d-460b-92b3-39332a6baa1c', '6621870d-4bfc-4721-9197-3dfe0b53a242', '6b8efd35-8d00-4ebf-a52d-e39be533e694', '6f4df95c-e52c-4ea3-9123-9c0129b855d6', '749a04fd-4637-4ece-afe7-4bdb7bc78b69', '765a1cd0-85b7-40fb-b9ca-ac63ed1df25c', '8654c1b4-3e5f-474a-9c28-5ae62ff3663c', '9a806a84-9296-4c0a-bffd-43e177f3b4ea', 'a0d5a9fa-7430-478a-894a-0fc09c350101', 'c5111eec-2707-471c-a55e-c8e96cb67365', 'c80f1972-7730-40bc-8b5e-b308d3c4fc25', 'e949e06c-aaec-46aa-b40d-abfc9953f219']",Sampling and Reconstruction of Spatial Fields Using Mobile Sensors,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2013
448,The finite-time control problem is considered for bilateral teleoperation system via output feedback approach. A new observer is designed for the velocity estimation and the resulting velocity error system is proved to be semi-globally stable. The observer based output feedback finite-time controller is developed by employing a novel nonsingular fast integral terminal sliding mode. The closed-loop system is proved to be stable based on Lyapunov stability theory. It is shown that the master-slave synchronization error converges to zero in finite time. The merit of the proposed method is that the designed controller only uses the position information which renders that the master-slave synchronization error reaches zero in the prescribed time. Simulation and experiment are performed and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.,"['Yana Yang', 'Changchun Hua', 'Junpeng Li', 'Xinping Guan']",883abaae-49c3-4776-a5d5-d98eebf943aa,0,"['0794bebe-52fb-46e8-b30a-e80455f68a40', '0f38ed4c-8be0-4e9b-993a-53b52fbba184', '1a5f9a61-b893-4f9f-aebe-da6d4aa46ff0', '1dd1fc8c-f331-4e1a-bfb3-3b79e55b7fab', '20a36ff4-8c60-4f54-9dbe-c47cc8f05ba5', '303a9995-f4aa-4ac6-8424-072366d8d10b', '4a61c283-2e64-4a19-b72a-b122bb052312', '513f4b35-25f7-4430-9f7e-944d0c1e2e6a', '5a587b34-71d8-4fdb-9554-806bd4016c78', '5a6f8534-5709-426d-87f4-fd35a8a664de', '5b1f0e4b-fe5c-4d03-89a3-ffc0694c3c83', '640ac015-8bd4-46c5-8011-f0af311a5919', '713ac171-5e3f-4954-b36b-8b01cef3cb59', '82102ca8-f7fd-453c-85dc-7ad7f1dc27da', 'a0d9f334-8e8d-495f-b929-78bae8676dd4', 'a1c3a6a1-7f62-40b7-b0f1-1d46468e895a', 'a1fafd10-8714-4016-a0d8-00848e2c58d9', 'aaaff14f-f9bf-405b-9248-143efd7b4f9a', 'b88524d2-d450-4584-a41b-a7f164667730', 'bc8eaf48-c221-41b5-bd28-cad338afcc26', 'c6d81868-2a69-4cdf-915b-b56b0fd85918', 'c95ecee6-3ba9-481c-8f80-7740c5450048', 'd85c5ab2-4a4a-4097-8aa3-8d7c93832957', 'ddcfb7e7-f9a8-4b91-b245-ff2ecfe711a5', 'e3fdfeff-a437-4221-bf35-0019ee9e34df', 'f1861493-a6f1-4e1e-9bce-ef78f44affd3', 'f5e18b1a-22bc-4a19-ab2a-643289c2d378', 'f77ee22e-df42-4c04-9ed0-83b730a8e3cb']",Finite-time output-feedback synchronization control for bilateral teleoperation system via neural networks,Information Sciences,2017
449,"In recent years, crowdsourcing has emerged as a new computing paradigm for bridging the gap between human- and machine-based computation. As one of the core operations in data retrieval, we study top- k  queries with crowdsourcing, namely  crowd-enabled top- k  queries . This problem is formulated with three key factors,  latency, monetary cost , and  quality of answers . We first aim to design a novel framework that minimizes monetary cost when latency is constrained. Toward this goal, we employ a two-phase  parameterized framework  with two parameters, called  buckets  and  ranges . On top of this framework, we develop three methods:  greedy, equi-sized , and  dynamic programming , to determine the buckets and ranges. By combining the three methods at each phase, we propose four algorithms:  GdyBucket ,  EquiBucket ,  EquiRange , and  CrowdK . When the crowd answers are imprecise, we also address improving the accuracy of the top- k  answers. Lastly, using both simulated crowds and real crowds at Amazon Mechanical Turk, we evaluate the trade-off between our proposals with respect to monetary cost, accuracy of answers, and running time. Compared to other competitive algorithms, it is found that  CrowdK  reduces monetary cost up to 20 times, without sacrificing the accuracy of the top- k  answers.","['Jongwuk Lee', 'Dongwon Lee', 'Seung-won Hwang']",8fb0807a-49df-4587-89e5-eb4c5bcfd10e,0,"['03199a21-42c6-4849-8032-f8b412d41dc0', '090516d9-5dbd-4303-bbb5-d6bfab91197a', '0f8aab77-6028-49eb-9f06-064fbe833406', '1420f84f-45c0-40f7-94de-0134c2c81f2c', '1576eeee-ae98-4fc5-b675-48736ab083eb', '1bc590fd-5be3-4ebf-965c-3329fe41bbf0', '1f5d9064-f3da-4c90-b780-5c687fc6ef56', '36b6c200-e50e-4789-9aea-b59da89d332c', '43457eb0-3026-41ba-aa8c-33d7ca73aa25', '4a96b72d-0565-4a5d-b7ea-86dfe925739a', '52c8c59d-64d9-417a-a479-44d321369476', '561945eb-ef55-4e62-83ee-0b9cefa5d117', '59887ba4-9637-4c58-820e-b4ddecc873cb', '5f783028-7a54-42cb-85d3-4cb6811967ce', '68d8b915-72ca-4e8f-aac6-a9bd56b558bd', '6ef2b150-1723-47cb-bff1-6ceafa71c755', '7e9a58e1-1d45-42a2-8ad1-1913dd1be835', '8be8b1aa-23ad-413d-9195-1a7983213266', '9084ac81-314a-4c3f-8229-03702b78c4e2', '90c4422e-cba2-41ba-8cba-b2d34db90428', '913eb498-786e-4572-a95d-b38ea8aab52d', '9f0a35ba-77af-4c42-ab88-bed8ae2edf05', 'a68bdd10-704f-416a-9a27-1297d3566336', 'b4bdfa8b-694c-4724-a7ea-5d9a04c78362', 'bea5955a-3c8e-44a5-b4c9-b7092434c6a7', 'c7e6bd7a-3c31-47a5-9ff0-e162d3e0fe85', 'cbc98651-c30c-40a1-91de-2ced1f3d33b1', 'cedd7a26-0809-4e2c-af22-46833fff70c2', 'd7d63fce-55e5-4b8b-93a4-392d85a42e47', 'd86bfa25-c265-405f-bd16-e694fd3eb4d5', 'dab3039a-910e-400d-827e-3ce6cb2faedf', 'dabc22fa-9de7-449f-8ac9-d0ee6667f908', 'df527ebe-5e4b-4bec-a1c3-d6a3b054fc25', 'e120103d-2a20-4bab-ae56-41cb3cf88b7c', 'e82c6aab-a77a-4eb4-b79d-661073af4797', 'ed6aa911-5979-4d53-8c27-3ff001f6a3be', 'f22080e2-0a7e-4875-8800-631dcbba42b5', 'fba0a445-604e-47d5-9717-3f42d23aeec7']",CrowdK: Answering top-k queries with crowdsourcing,Information Sciences,2017
450,"Abstract  Objective  In the UK, General Practitioners and Practice Managers are key to enabling health information exchange (typically referred to as ‘data sharing'). This study aimed to survey GPs and PMs for familiarity, engagement with and perceptions of patient data sharing.  Methods  Cross-sectional survey. All 107 general practices in England's second largest Clinical Commissioning Group, Cambridgeshire & Peterborough CCG. Descriptive statistics; hierarchical logistic regression; thematic analysis.  Results  405 (64%) responses were received – from 338 (62%) GPs and 67 (71%) PMs. Familiarity and engagement were highest for local frail elderly and end of life care projects (>76% had used). The greatest difference in use concerned the now suspended national  care.data  initiative: PMs had odds of reporting use 75 times higher than GP partners (95% CI 27–211). Patient confusion was the most pronounced challenge and improved coordination the most pronounced expected benefit. Frequency of discussions with patients varied with IT competence (OR 4.2 for most competent users relative to least, 95% CI 1.7–10.7) and clinical system (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.5). Patient reservations were reported more frequently by respondents who rated their IT competence as highest (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5–7.6), perceived more data sharing challenges (OR for a 1-point increase in challenges perception score 3.4, 95% CI 2.1–5.6) and by PMs (relative to GP partners, OR 18.0, 95% CI 7.9–41.3).  Conclusions  Familiarity with and use of data sharing projects was high among GPs and PMs. Both their individual and organisational characteristics were associated with the reported frequency of discussions and patients' responses. Improved awareness of the impact of provider characteristics and attitudes on patients' decisions about data sharing may enhance the equity and autonomy of those decisions.","['Mila Petrova', 'Matthew Barclay', 'Sam S.

451,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an indispensable and extensively used sensor in ship detection. As high-resolution SAR introduces more spatial details into images, this letter proposes an intensity-space (IS) domain constant false alarm rate (CFAR) ship detector to make good use of this information. The method fuses intensity of each pixel and correlations between pixels into one characteristic, i.e., IS index. All the detection procedures center on the calculation and analysis of IS index. First, a new transform maps an image into a new IS domain. Structures like ships and wakes are enhanced in IS domain. Second, a CFAR detector picks up high IS index pixels. Third, a chain of target features is checked to screen out false candidate target pixels. Also, enhanced wakes are taken to improve detection results. Experiments on real SAR images validate that the proposed transform does enhance these structures and the whole algorithm is of good performance, especially in the case of low-contrast targets.","['Chonglei Wang', 'Fukun Bi', 'Weiping Zhang', 'Liang Chen']",29fc25f1-167f-4362-905c-c35990d9fdb6,0,"['019ec67f-33e5-4533-b77b-d11eb007b541', '23e1f6d7-a095-4dc1-b2a6-d41b5a3c89cb', '51adde42-489e-407d-bc3e-39604ae236b0', '8a576e1d-4891-4a55-a501-5d22e70217dd', 'ccc8220e-4d85-45cf-ad6a-e7d63f6ca2c7', 'ef0a2a44-6b36-4b31-9385-e63b80cce68e', 'f71808bf-f63f-487c-aaef-dbba7181f821']",An Intensity-Space Domain CFAR Method for Ship Detection in HR SAR Images,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
452,"The relationship between the surface Electromyogram (sEMG) signal and the force of an individual muscle is still ambiguous due to the complexity of experimental evaluation. However, understanding this relationship should be useful for the assessment of neuromuscular system in healthy and pathological contexts. In this study, we present a global investigation of the factors governing the shape of this relationship. Accordingly, we conducted a focused sensitivity analysis of the sEMG/force relationship form with respect to neural, functional and physiological parameters variation. For this purpose, we used a fast generation cylindrical model for the simulation of an 8×8 High Density-sEMG (HD-sEMG) grid and a twitch based force model for the muscle force generation. The HD-sEMG signals as well as the corresponding force signals were simulated in isometric non-fatiguing conditions and were based on the Biceps Brachii (BB) muscle properties. A total of 10 isometric constant contractions of 5s were simulated for each configuration of parameters. The Root Mean Squared (RMS) value was computed in order to quantify the sEMG amplitude. Then, an image segmentation method was used for data fusion of the 8×8 RMS maps. In addition, a comparative study between recent modeling propositions and the model proposed in this study is presented.

453,"We consider the problem of allocating processing times in a multi-station series system characterized by high variability. Servers are arranged into multiple stations in series with the objective of minimizing the waiting time through a truncation scheme. Every station has a threshold on the amount of time spent servicing a job. A job being served at Station i   that has a processing time exceeding this station’s threshold is forwarded to Station i+1i+1. Otherwise, the job completes its service at Station i and leaves the system. We develop an analytical model to determine the optimal system configuration, in terms of the number of stations, the corresponding thresholds, and the number of servers at each station, for a given number of servers facing Poisson demand. In order to simplify the computation of the thresholds, we assume that the load is balanced among different stations. We justify this assumption with numerical and analytical evidence. Our analytical and numerical results indicate that, under high traffic intensity, our series system performs better than the standard M/G/c and other variants having two stations only, when the shape of the service time distribution allows reducing variability by multiple truncations. Our results also indicate that having a moderate number of stations is beneficial as this offers a good trade-off between variance reduction and idle time downstream. Two by-products of our work are (i) comparing the accuracy of several M/G/c waiting time approximations via simulation, with service times following a family of balanced hyperexponential distributions, and (ii) testing the appropriate M/G/c simulation length. We find that approximations by Whitt (1989, 1993) to be adequate.","['Bacel Maddah', 'Walid W.

454,"With a rapid development of high-throughput genomic technologies, a vast amount of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) data has been generated for difference species. However, such set of PPIs is rather small when compared with all possible PPIs. Hence, there is a necessity to specifically develop computational algorithms for large-scale PPI prediction. In response to this need, we propose a parallel algorithm, namely pVLASPD, to perform the prediction task in a distributed manner. In particular, pVLASPD was modified based on the VLASPD algorithm for the purpose of improving the efficiency of VLASPD while maintaining a comparable effectiveness. To do so, we first analyzed VLASPD step by step to identify the places that caused the bottlenecks of efficiency. After that, pVLASPD was developed by parallelizing those inefficient places with the framework of MapReduce. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of pVLASPD when applied to prediction of large-scale PPIs.","['Lun Hu', 'Xiaohui Yuan', 'Pengwei Hu', 'Keith C. C.

455,"The cost of using a computational resource is measured from startup to shutdown, including the cost of time slots between tasks. Concurrent scheduling of multiple scientific workflows on heterogeneous resources can improve resources utilization and reduce the cost. To make full use of waste time slots between the tasks and improve the completion rate of workflows, Expansion Slot Backfill (ESB) algorithm is proposed in this paper for scheduling multiple deadline-constrained workflows on a fixed set of resources. All workflows are mapped to the resources with one by one strategy. Each new task tries to backfill the earliest time slot in turn. When the time slot is not enough to backfill, it can be expanded elastically by the slide of the earlier tasks. If these tasks slide cause some workflow to exceed the deadline constraint, such workflow with fewer time slots is discarded and the slide is withdrawn. Experiments with multiple parameter variations show that the algorithm get better performance in resource utilization, workflows throughput and time complexity.","['Xiujie Xu', 'Chuangbai Xiao', 'Guozhong Tian', 'Ting Sun']",7efe8c83-dd9b-48e7-8e25-0754082847e7,0,"['16ee7fc6-ddcf-4593-89d3-cb39dfe710f4', '2940b5d7-e736-46c7-9e3c-a9b792d643b8', '37387ba7-b520-4f61-8ae3-8dbb74913d1a', '4683ed35-de44-47b5-b62d-332e70bc1565', '4f0a701e-17bd-4f1f-9515-8f5ed9c069e4', '6320b674-33ed-49bb-9cbc-fb2401377b46', '6dfd93d8-aad5-412b-a1ae-5a0f94f1369e', '71b9b7a4-43c0-4a36-8833-da3ffff05c3a', '79f5c666-6c71-418a-9b07-05bd13129873', '7db2b197-8e01-4f45-b354-4a9aa5d3cb61', '862dd47e-b8f1-4761-81da-c2b015a9d4cd', '948268b6-8def-4d24-a9e2-543b9ed9fa45', '9de125f6-4923-4ed1-a885-38ecc14e6dab', 'aa2b777a-6a2d-437b-bc11-96d18fcc51b7', 'b33b96e1-99c7-427b-b349-905d53563cb7', 'be2e913f-3e0b-4f41-9d51-1b7d82afeeae', 'be7f279e-4a10-4ceb-8313-2776440c2f67', 'c4a591bc-de4b-4387-837b-cca3c5662fec', 'c7088a13-39dc-416e-bffe-524915744014', 'c7fcd899-0397-4349-acc6-7ee48fb36674', 'f2b227ce-71e4-42dc-ba18-37118586b24c', 'fb555a34-b41f-481b-a3fc-f9ce458af059']",Expansion slot backfill scheduling for concurrent workflows with deadline on heterogeneous resources,Cluster Computing,2017
456,"Urban geological hazards involving ground instability can be costly, dangerous, and affect many people, yet there is little information about the extent or distribution of geohazards within Europe’s urban areas. A reason for this is the impracticality of measuring ground instability associated with the many geohazard processes that are often hidden beneath buildings and are imperceptible to conventional geological survey detection techniques. Satellite radar interferometry, or InSAR, offers a remote sensing technique to map mm-scale ground deformation over wide areas given an archive of suitable multi-temporal data. The EC FP7 Space project named PanGeo (2011–2014), used InSAR to map areas of unstable ground in 52 of Europe’s cities, representing ∼15% of the EU population. In partnership with Europe’s national geological surveys, the PanGeo project developed a standardised geohazard-mapping methodology and recorded 1286 instances of 19 types of geohazard covering 18,000 km2. Presented here is an analysis of the results of the PanGeo-project output data, which provides insights into the distribution of European urban geohazards, their frequency and probability of occurrence. Merging PanGeo data with Eurostat’s GeoStat data provides a systematic estimate of population exposures. Satellite radar interferometry is shown to be as a valuable tool for the systematic detection and mapping of urban geohazard phenomena.","['Renalt Capes', 'Richard Teeuw']",b87e7869-f583-4ba5-8415-36d0046ea042,0,"['0b69bda7-31da-4773-925b-0dd02cf9a192', '82e726b6-eb50-44df-a770-05cc17e54dea', 'a1e7ee0e-7c03-4811-8311-4a64e7de3b85']",On safe ground?

457,"In this paper, we present unconditionally optimal error estimates of linearized Crank–Nicolson Galerkin finite element methods for a strongly nonlinear parabolic system in \(\mathbb {R},^d\ (d=2,3)\). However, all previous works required certain time-step conditions that were dependent on the spatial mesh size. In order to overcome several entitative difficulties caused by the strong nonlinearity of the system, the proof takes two steps. First, by using a temporal-spatial error splitting argument and a new technique, optimal \(L^2\) error estimates of the numerical schemes can be obtained under the condition \(\tau \ge h\), where \(\tau \) denotes the time-step size and h is the spatial mesh size. Second, we obtain the boundedness of numerical solutions by mathematical induction and inverse inequality when \(\tau \le h\). Then, optimal \(L^2\) and \(H^1\) error estimates are proved in a different way for such case. Numerical results are given to illustrate our theoretical analyses.","['Dongfang Li', 'Jilu Wang']",608851fd-75fc-439a-909a-9606cb0f6c7a,0,"['076a02f1-7658-44a8-a78e-8b7b64d9d29f', '0881fcca-6f54-47cc-9b83-07f3998c617e', '34862b90-9558-41bf-af70-965cdc11f3e6', '3f39a52c-c5ff-4c0c-95ee-99909531b0b3', '4a95ac7f-fdf0-445c-b72d-0502eac36086', '5278d918-abd4-4824-bf93-56cef83a2951', '5e0c87de-a1cd-49da-8033-078ed7074c24', '710b5bc9-5cf4-481f-8df4-ee72188ed19a', '735c834b-21a7-48dd-87a4-3b20511ff1eb', 'e3affde7-b3af-4236-9276-a90119cbb3a1']",Unconditionally Optimal Error Analysis of Crank–Nicolson Galerkin FEMs for a Strongly Nonlinear Parabolic System,Journal of Scientific Computing,2017

462,"This research investigated the process by which self-disclosure leads to liking in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Research has shown that CMC influences the attributions that individuals make regarding self-disclosure as well as the affection that they feel towards disclosers as a result of these attributions. However, little is known about the impact that attributions have on one's own reciprocal self-disclosure. In an original experiment, dyads of friends or strangers disclosed to one another in text-based CMC. After their discussion, a questionnaire assessed participants' liking toward their partners as well as their attributions regarding their partners' behavior. Results show that self-disclosure prompted receivers' interpersonal attributions, which led receivers to like their partners. But, receivers' interpersonal attributions did not lead to reciprocal disclosure. The results corroborate Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock’s (2011) model that links self-disclosure and liking by way of interpersonal attributions, and demonstrate one disclosure-liking effect in CMC: People like those who self-disclose to them. This study provides further evidence for CMC's unique impact on the relationship between self-disclosure and liking, and contributes to our understanding of the interpersonal processes that lead to liking in CMC.","['Nicole Kashian', 'Jeong-woo Jang', 'Soo Yun Shin', 'Yue Dai', 'Joseph B.

The hovering function effectively acts as the finger tracking sensor thereby allowing the user to type in the virtual space. When added with the additional phase to correct the initial touch input and having the final key entered upon the finger release, the proposed method showed competitive performance to that of the conventional “aim-and-shoot” method and also exhibited much higher usability. HoVR-Type also showed a significantly faster speed of input for the individual character. However, it remains to improve the interface with regards to reducing the error. Overall, the use of the smartphone leverages on the already established mobile user experience and can be further extended to other VR interaction techniques so that one can use the common smartphone as an all-purpose VR interaction device.","['Youngwon R.

467,"Among the most pressing concerns of land managers in post-wildfire landscapes are the establishment and spread of invasive species. Land managers need accurate maps of invasive species cover for targeted management post-disturbance that are easily transferable across space and time. In this study, we sought to develop an iterative, replicable methodology based on limited invasive species occurrence data, freely available remotely sensed data, and open source software to predict the distribution of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) in a post-wildfire landscape. We developed four species distribution models using eight spectral indices derived from five months of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data in 2014. These months corresponded to both cheatgrass growing period and time of field data collection in the study area. The four models were improved using an iterative approach in which a threshold for cover was established, and all models had high sensitivity values when tested on an independent dataset. We also quantified the area at highest risk for invasion in future seasons given 2014 distribution, topographic covariates, and seed dispersal limitations. These models demonstrate the effectiveness of using derived multi-date spectral indices as proxies for species occurrence on the landscape, the importance of selecting thresholds for invasive species cover to evaluate ecological risk in species distribution models, and the applicability of Landsat 8 OLI and the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling for targeted invasive species management.","['Amanda M.

468,"One goal of structural biology is to understand how a protein’s 3-dimensional conformation determines its capacity to interact with potential ligands. In the case of small chemical ligands, deconstructing a static protein-ligand complex into its constituent atom-atom interactions is typically sufficient to rapidly predict ligand affinity with high accuracy (>70% correlation between predicted and experimentally-determined affinity), a fact that is exploited to support structure-based drug design. We recently found that protein-DNA/RNA affinity can also be predicted with high accuracy using extensions of existing techniques, but protein-protein affinity could not be predicted with >60% correlation, even when the protein-protein complex was available. X-ray and NMR structures of protein-protein complexes, their associated binding affinities and experimental conditions were obtained from different binding affinity and structural databases. Statistical models were implemented using a generalized linear model framework, including the experimental conditions as new model features. We evaluated the potential for new features to improve affinity prediction models by calculating the Pearson correlation between predicted and experimental binding affinities on the training and test data after model fitting and after cross-validation. Differences in accuracy were assessed using two-sample t test and nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test. Here we evaluate a range of potential factors that may interfere with accurate protein-protein affinity prediction. We find that X-ray crystal resolution has the strongest single effect on protein-protein affinity prediction. Limiting our analyses to only high-resolution complexes (≤2.5 A) increased the correlation between predicted and experimental affinity from 54 to 68% (p = 4.32x10−3). In addition, incorporating information on the experimental conditions under which affinities were measured (pH, temperature and binding assay) had significant effects on prediction accuracy. We also highlight a number of potential errors in large structure-affinity databases, which could affect both model training and accuracy assessment. The results suggest that the accuracy of statistical models for protein-protein affinity prediction may be limited by the information present in databases used to train new models. Improving our capacity to integrate large-scale structural and functional information may be required to substantively advance our understanding of the general principles by which a protein’s structure determines its function.","['Raquel Dias', 'Bryan Kolaczkowski']",e84944ec-11b8-4445-9897-44cab201b1a9,50,"['04413dcb-86f4-4eb8-a9ab-77233773dc08', '07b3aebb-8f82-4a32-8def-85067b84e9fa', '1a5015f8-6b26-4fb2-ba5a-2e1cc0345b39', '237b5afa-4ade-4944-95e6-c3bb93cdcaec', '2ba936d2-01a9-4ae8-9481-bbbda532c808', '349e1d8b-2e7a-4694-8c96-45c892bc179c', '39facc97-4d5e-42eb-ac34-b556d5492439', '4c7af5f6-539c-4f29-b7e3-a797a7ffd643', '5917198e-ec77-42ce-9383-636f6ed567b5', '6d455cda-fd1c-4917-9488-cb5dece194a4', '8653acbf-7121-4555-9f8c-02e7b5137034', 'a390c1f5-5b9c-4e5e-bea5-ee3872b7af7c', 'cd592ef0-f4ee-4b97-9b78-cb89b96af4fd', 'da15c39e-0419-4ea8-a9da-2e5b31104464', 'db6706ab-b50e-4d76-8f9e-17bbcba9cbc2', 'ddf9cf25-8050-4418-95fe-9a9e7b0c3369', 'f95751ab-8fc6-4827-9f98-607332120c89', 'fdda4e8d-0ee7-45cd-9641-57c79c755d27']",Improving the accuracy of high-throughput protein-protein affinity prediction may require better training data,BMC Bioinformatics,2017

470,"Collaborative spectrum sensing has become increasingly popular in cognitive radio networks to enable unlicensed secondary users to coexist with the licensed primary users and share spectrum without interference. Despite its promise in performance enhancement, collaborative sensing is still facing a lot of security challenges. The problem of revealing secondary users’ location information through sensing reports has been reported recently. Unlike any existing work, in this paper we not only address the location privacy issue in the collaborative sensing to be against semi-honest adversaries, but also take malicious adversaries into consideration. We propose efficient schemes to protect secondary users’ reports from being revealed in the aggregation process at the fusion center. We rigorously prove that our privacy-preserving collaborative sensing schemes are secure against attacks from both the fusion center and secondary users. We also evaluate our schemes extensively and verify its efficiency and feasibility.","['Yunlong Mao', 'Tingting Chen', 'Yuan Zhang', 'Tiancong Wang', 'Sheng Zhong']",f5eb8375-6846-4a2c-bd9c-5c6965912e40,0,"['03a7a538-f8d7-4ac3-a522-09f6d48e9585', '138feefe-5162-4105-9c08-c0ac969690f1', '1e7e39e3-3221-46e0-a63d-46c5a68a2508', '4393e492-d8cb-4b68-ab06-4bf20bb78dc4', '5395adde-7483-40c7-a58e-e26e339e1291', '68f3a7d4-d842-4d5f-ab20-f20b8a43444d', '7077c51e-e973-4dff-b81c-7b9851f9711b', '7a55c276-e95a-4259-8098-aecf0c4f0816', '7b230bf6-c609-4f6c-b25e-79039af0a96b', '9e657010-c647-4c27-85b8-20632c629a0e', 'a2cd0e23-f184-441d-b90e-d4492a9ef508', 'af8f3731-c0ff-42f7-821e-042f428e29f6', 'b191d257-13a7-496c-8cce-5cc88eb04820', 'b56e1722-e3fc-4f0f-8559-d5c59b8e776d', 'bd7fe19a-73bf-4928-8c49-c86ed16820e0', 'd6ba3d2d-816f-495a-b9fb-2ba768b585e6', 'd893a420-a00d-4756-b447-2862ed178eaa', 'de3ad257-2c7b-4334-9c0d-1cf3f23f7ce2', 'df999339-52c3-445f-b0df-87dc23e77bb3', 'ecfabebd-3e23-401b-ba01-f3d8b7f330d0', 'faa3f6a3-8cdc-4a0f-b12d-aa41fabb9c3f', 'fca7f91b-74a2-426e-93c8-1bc4e46d6228']",Towards Privacy-Preserving Aggregation for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,2017
471,"Managing socio-ecological systems is a challenge wrought by competing societal objectives, deep uncertainties, and potentially irreversible tipping points. A classic, didactic example is the shallow lake problem in which a hypothetical town situated on a lake must develop pollution control strategies to maximize its economic benefits while minimizing the probability of the lake crossing a critical phosphorus (P) threshold, above which it irreversibly transitions into a eutrophic state. Here, we explore the use of direct policy search (DPS) to design robust pollution control rules for the town that account for deeply uncertain system characteristics and conflicting objectives. The closed loop control formulation of DPS improves the quality and robustness of key management tradeoffs, while dramatically reducing the computational complexity of solving the multi-objective pollution control problem relative to open loop control strategies. These insights suggest DPS is a promising tool for managing socio-ecological systems with deeply uncertain tipping points.","['Julianne Quinn', 'Patrick M.

472,"The CRISPR–Cas systems in prokaryotes are RNA-guided immune systems that target and deactivate foreign nucleic acids. A typical CRISPR–Cas system consists of a CRISPR array of repeat and spacer units, and a locus of cas genes. The CRISPR and the cas locus are often located next to each other in the genomes. However, there is no quantitative estimate of the co-location. In addition, ad-hoc studies have shown that some non-CRISPR genomic elements contain repeat-spacer-like structures and are mistaken as CRISPRs. Using available genome sequences, we observed that a significant number of genomes have isolated cas loci and/or CRISPRs. We found that 11%, 22% and 28% of the type I, II and III cas loci are isolated (without CRISPRs in the same genomes at all or with CRISPRs distant in the genomes), respectively. We identified a large number of genomic elements that superficially reassemble CRISPRs but don’t contain diverse spacers and have no companion cas genes. We called these elements false-CRISPRs and further classified them into groups, including tandem repeats and Staphylococcus aureus repeat (STAR)-like elements. This is the first systematic study to collect and characterize false-CRISPR elements. We demonstrated that false-CRISPRs could be used to reduce the false annotation of CRISPRs, therefore showing them to be useful for improving the annotation of CRISPR–Cas systems.","['Quan Zhang', 'Yuzhen Ye']",fa021857-90aa-46c3-9a54-e4b7b25c97a4,0,"['04ed08c3-7e37-462f-aec2-9a7e9393e5da', '2007e6cd-bea4-4783-8413-bad85c896cca', '38c96413-dd6c-4c61-8f74-037ae85f5ffc', '4e6b5714-02cb-4c98-8778-5006d113a211', '8043a798-5e76-4d03-96d7-e72d3c4f7fb4', '8597ea85-3d56-4b39-b839-5194e2e57d5b', '8c9ba792-9ea3-4f87-a5ae-ad74e96ee20c', 'bc264d91-778b-43ab-869e-5b62fedf943c', 'c0c81584-0ce7-4ed9-97af-f0470abd3670', 'ca04cea4-7f74-4501-aa41-877fdc97ba32']",Not all predicted CRISPR–Cas systems are equal: isolated cas genes and classes of CRISPR like elements,BMC Bioinformatics,2017

474,"Mobile crowd sensing has become an emerging computing and sensing paradigm that recruits ordinary participants to perform sensing tasks. With the highly dynamic mobility pattern and the abundance of on-board resources, vehicles have been increasingly recruited to participate large-scale crowd sensing applications such as urban sensing. However, existing participant recruitment algorithms take a long time in recruitment decision for large number of vehicular participants. In this paper, a fast algorithm for vehicle participant recruitment problem is proposed, which achieves linear-time complexity at the sacrifice of a slightly lower sensing quality. The participant recruitment problem is modeled as a unconstrained maximization problem without explicitly cost constraint and a trade-off parameter is introduced to control the recruiter cost. Trace-driven simulations on both real-world and synthetic data-sets are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is 50 times faster than the state-of-art algorithm at the sacrifice of   5%     5  %        lower sensing quality when the number of participants is over 1000.","['Kefu Yi', 'Ronghua Du', 'Li Liu', 'Qingying Chen', 'Kai Gao']",ec02dca9-48c7-43dc-b6d5-870d7837f701,0,"['0e1aa582-c891-4fad-8d43-5895b182043d', '0f5a8cb9-4a0a-4365-8697-2706331ff37b', '0ffa9454-829a-4a92-8c88-4b8fc6bc15cf', '13bbecd3-df88-40b7-b1b1-9ba75d70e151', '172f9f68-8417-43bb-8fe5-b377d569f6b6', '178f4c4a-9040-4d8e-8e21-4cc3c629e136', '20b17674-6606-4774-bf56-5aec159dd1f9', '22f51cc0-9c7b-4412-8cd8-824ca1146368', '277a6fdf-faf7-4842-a912-079aafbde9a7', '64e7b0c9-edfe-40df-8104-e479c212e97c', '69fae176-953c-499a-889e-6a82539f4160', '6b2fb7b2-0612-4cf2-b55c-b7d2dc710357', '73a46e7c-fbe8-42fa-b04a-a97e1bd3264e', '8c72b4cf-037a-42f6-9209-8e4f8699851d', '8dda3a89-be18-41c8-8df9-d102e2ab0209', '929b23bd-972a-4f39-8812-a918c01ede65', 'aa04b600-65f7-440e-b00b-e2f00e9e44f1', 'b16800f4-f489-4516-a8bd-aea790770274', 'b2a440e2-5ac2-4726-8a33-7801acd3aae4', 'ccb9f2a7-ead5-4c84-871b-32917b278044', 'd4596140-f912-4f66-b750-0a63b3b048dc', 'db2da165-c9f2-44e1-a462-1fa93b4bc369', 'e58270bd-f0aa-47ef-8fd1-4ce2b23fdb70', 'e9540362-cca5-47b6-852f-bdf3f50e3872']",Fast participant recruitment algorithm for large-scale Vehicle-based Mobile Crowd Sensing,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,2017

However, the convenient use of GIS software has resulted in users easily ignoring the threat of data misuse because of the lack of understanding of data quality. Here we argue that data quality considerations must be coherently assimilated into the GIS operation design to visually present helpful information and ensure the accuracy of data for decision making. Data completeness is selected in this paper to demonstrate how the use of data quality information opens a new dimension to the design of future GIS software.

477,"Cognitive functions such as sensory processing and memory processes lead to phase synchronization in the electroencephalogram or local field potential between different brain regions. There are a lot of computational researches deriving phase locking values (PLVs), which are an index of phase synchronization intensity, from neural models. However, these researches derive PLVs numerically. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the derivation of a theoretical PLV. In this study, we propose an analytical method for deriving theoretical PLVs from a cortico-thalamic neural mass model described by a delay differential equation. First, the model for generating neural signals is transformed into a normal form of the Hopf bifurcation using center manifold reduction. Second, the normal form is transformed into a phase model that is suitable for analyzing synchronization phenomena. Third, the Fokker–Planck equation of the phase model is derived and the phase difference distribution is obtained. Finally, the PLVs are calculated from the stationary distribution of the phase difference. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed via numerical simulations. Furthermore, we apply the proposed method to a working memory process, and discuss the neurophysiological basis behind the phase synchronization phenomenon. The results demonstrate the importance of decreasing the intensity of independent noise during the working memory process. The proposed method will be of great use in various experimental studies and simulations relevant to phase synchronization, because it enables the effect of neurophysiological changes on PLVs to be analyzed from a mathematical perspective.","['Yutaro Ogawa', 'Ikuhiro Yamaguchi', 'Kiyoshi Kotani', 'Yasuhiko Jimbo']",9c9da664-85dd-4ba4-b656-cebb44eaad2d,0,"['0819624e-2fe7-484f-9f8c-f29231a81002', '2b9bd73e-066f-48af-a103-6043816b112e', '3c85c5b6-3d17-4334-8e01-3b4efd83cd57', '5796eb8e-d00d-4388-b557-56bcf7401858', '711d1b66-be9d-4f55-9f4f-c9b7d569aabf', 'a23fe840-ecf4-4c54-90a6-532a76cd8af6', 'bc9cd3f4-752b-4bb7-803f-a9fd135a3dda', 'faf0bcad-03aa-446b-bccf-0318b37f097b']",Deriving theoretical phase locking values of a coupled cortico-thalamic neural mass model using center manifold reduction,Journal of Computational Neuroscience,2017
478,"Kidney segmentation is an essential step in developing any noninvasive computer-assisted diagnostic system for renal function assessment. This paper introduces an automated framework for 3D kidney segmentation from dynamic computed tomography (CT) images that integrates discriminative features from the current and prior CT appearances into a random forest classification approach. To account for CT images’ inhomogeneities, we employ discriminate features that are extracted from a higher-order spatial model and an adaptive shape model in addition to the first-order CT appearance. To model the interactions between CT data voxels, we employed a higher-order spatial model, which adds the triple and quad clique families to the traditional pairwise clique family. The kidney shape prior model is built using a set of training CT data and is updated during segmentation using not only region labels but also voxels’ appearances in neighboring spatial voxel locations. Our framework performance has been evaluated on in vivo dynamic CT data collected from 20 subjects and comprises multiple 3D scans acquired before and after contrast medium administration. Quantitative evaluation between manually and automatically segmented kidney contours using Dice similarity, percentage volume differences, and 95th-percentile bidirectional Hausdorff distances confirms the high accuracy of our approach.","['Fahmi Khalifa', 'Ahmed Soliman', 'Adel Said Elmaghraby', 'Georgy Gimel’farb', 'Ayman El-Baz']",d41c836d-ce7f-4125-8e53-e6f3c95fb2fa,0,"['1a8ee80e-de8a-4dc1-a1a0-fe0c56f18afb', '23c419b2-cbdf-46a3-85db-6110432d5749', '42a583dd-111b-45e0-8d65-54e2f10c850a', '443fb8d3-09ba-45a2-98a6-597799c3e63c', '532b1e1b-66fe-42ea-bdfe-4f5837651282', '60f42349-7bbb-466a-9835-e42e89f4c56c', 'a6b909ee-3766-40a5-929a-f8175115e020', 'ae9c26e0-ef71-4430-a593-be92d9e5bf18', 'c07e9d81-b1c8-4efc-b452-e2660813b4d0', 'c5032c08-1575-41eb-b2e6-af8f5dec9ed5', 'c6dd1155-2ec9-4371-96dc-3ee5f42387ff', 'd58ec925-cbe3-4c09-8dc9-bc9a542f6223', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6', 'fd0db827-fd13-436a-8245-609ecceec1a1']",3D Kidney Segmentation from Abdominal Images Using Spatial-Appearance Models,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2017
479,"Sugeno integrals are aggregation operations involving a criterion weighting scheme based on the use of set functions called capacities or fuzzy measures. In this paper, we define generalized versions of Sugeno integrals on totally ordered bounded chains, by extending the operation that combines the value of the capacity on each subset of criteria and the value of the utility function over elements of the subset. We show that the generalized concept of Sugeno integral splits into two functionals, one based on a general multiple-valued conjunction (we call integral) and one based on a general multiple-valued implication (we call cointegral). These conjunction and implication connectives are related via a so-called semiduality property, involving an involutive negation. Sugeno integrals correspond to the case when the conjunction is the minimum and the implication is Kleene-Dienes implication, in which case integrals and cointegrals coincide. In this paper, we consider a very general class of conjunction operations on a finite setting, that reduce to Boolean conjunctions on extreme values of the bounded chain, and are non-decreasing in each place, and the corresponding general class of implications (their semiduals). The merit of these new aggregation operators is to go beyond pure lattice polynomials, thus enhancing the expressive power of qualitative aggregation functions, especially as to the way an importance weight can affect a local rating of an object to be chosen.","['Didier Dubois', 'Henri Prade', 'Agnès Rico', 'Bruno Teheux']",7d35502a-65c1-4e13-8c9a-0c93d21e18bf,0,"['10dcc6ed-7fd4-4268-954b-d889aed3975c', '14ee39f9-1b16-48ea-9575-6ebc5cd3e185', '1ebb6477-2b79-47d5-927d-e9e3130c1337', '29601610-351f-45c1-8aea-ca02bbf231eb', '2bc72c77-fe73-492d-84c1-7a7bbf251cfb', '2fd5eeac-fb1c-44a2-94c6-5608db4df268', '33ffbe19-8f8f-4fb7-a44d-6d1d8d976ef6', '3cc566fd-87a7-4d2b-8ef1-303ad5eb903f', '6f73880b-1e16-48de-a14b-bff20dfd43ed', '778ba4c1-0945-4253-8620-ad8c7ee7a124', '91147f24-d014-4f09-ad32-61b0aac2f638', '96c210e3-f75b-4e15-b3fa-c9ee755e4cc2', 'b402ee0a-cdd7-4ac0-9924-89463e83f3a1', 'e6d4cfd0-4f3b-4926-a4d2-86151b29bb8e', 'e879d42f-04eb-4a5f-b98b-ae6d9e9a9ba2', 'efaf7e17-6b68-4f9f-8550-0ee758578ede']",Generalized Qualitative Sugeno Integrals,Information Sciences,2017

The nonlinear systems are represented by a linear model along with an additive nonlinear term which is locally Lipschitz. As an unstructured uncertainty, this term is replaced in the robust stability constraint by its Lipschitz coefficient. A scheduled control technique is employed to transfer the system to desired set points, given online, by designing local robust model predictive controllers. This scheme includes estimating the regions of feasibility and stability of the related equilibriums and online switching among the local controllers. The proposed optimisation problems for calculating the regions of feasibility and stability are defined as linear matrix inequalities that can be solved in polynomial time. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated by an example.","['Maryam Razi', 'Mohammad Haeri']",81b659a6-f273-4e7b-8cd3-162b6015e833,0,"['25c90446-8639-4542-8e8c-b4a94060690b', '27f5ca17-d55e-4bd4-87e3-c0a66f65c8a2', '3f618dc1-1156-4a55-b092-c946db4456b4', '44875905-c566-4aca-a821-83e529f0b087', '488d5421-82f3-4565-8463-22c58ba9d045', '48c65322-8933-421c-9e10-dcc9d2eff810', '72baf93d-3c90-4d4b-b5ee-a27cc5ef2fca', '77129316-895a-4f08-958f-c2c505a3ce51', 'b4f0a1af-59bf-4cd2-90a6-3830d7eb4ac1', 'da89c677-dfd1-4caa-bb71-346c241d855c', 'e50e051b-19c5-40da-97d5-aab3c51a1665']",Efficient algorithms for online tracking of set points in robust model predictive control,International Journal of Systems Science,2017
481,"Software testing is important and time-consuming. A test suite, i.e., a set of test cases, plays a key role in validating the expected program behavior. In modern test-driven development, a test suite pushes the development progress. Software evolves over time; its test suite is executed to detect whether a new code change adds bugs to the existing code. Executing all test cases after each code change is unnecessary and may be impossible due to the limited development cycle. On the one hand, multiple test cases may focus on an identical piece of code; then several test cases cannot detect extra bugs. On the other hand, even executing a test suite once in a large project takes around one hour [1]; frequent code changes require much time for conducting testing.

483,"Software components are frequently used in cyber-physical systems (CPSes) to control a physical mechanism, such as a valve or brakes on a car. These systems are extremely sensitive to software vulnerabilities, as their exploitation could lead to injury, damage to equipment, or environmental catastrophe. This paper proposes a hardware-based security architecture called SOFIA, which protects software running on microprocessors used in CPSes. SOFIA provides mechanisms to protect software integrity and control flow integrity. This allows the processor to defend against a large number of attacks, including code injection, code reuse, and fault-based attacks on the program counter. In addition, the architecture also defends against software copyright infringement and reverse engineering. All protection mechanisms are enforced in hardware using cryptographic techniques. We are the first to propose a mechanism to enforce control flow integrity at the finest possible granularity using cryptographic techniques. A SOFIA core has been created by implementing the proposed architectural features on a LEON3 microprocessor. The SOFIA core requires that its software conforms to a strict format. To this end, we additionally designed and implemented a software toolchain to compile source code that adheres to the formatting rules. Several benchmarks were compiled with the SOFIA toolchain, and were executed on a SOFIA core running on an FPGA, showing an average total execution time overhead of 106% compared to an unmodified LEON3 core. Our hardware evaluation shows a clock speed reduction of 23.2%.","['Ruan de Clercq', 'Johannes Götzfried', 'David Übler', 'Pieter Maene', 'Ingrid Verbauwhede']",2dca67cc-d065-4775-aba7-3ec7e2fd9916,0,"['0bac1dbc-54c0-43d8-b877-14352dc8a310', '0f0d92dc-6e64-4430-9801-9aa6d10c83cf', '14654576-52ec-468b-bfd5-7af9f9275878', '1d3e6e35-7838-46d1-87ce-5459e2edd319', '1f9eda27-a40c-4fe7-a11e-0b06ccc8469e', '28214cca-1885-415b-b685-d2876db15a89', '3192d36f-75c9-4563-b07a-53715d3fb43c', '3245bfc4-7d0d-4868-b7a3-d6953f13d5d5', '379319e5-058d-4c95-9c06-f28579eb63f9', '3ec4eb36-64a2-4ddd-82d8-d9e7112a2e91', '47ab65aa-2dce-48dc-8c5d-389be8c27229', '4ab07f5b-8e4e-494d-b5f1-d976b3e05952', '4f64fb72-d00b-4fcc-b67b-e66f6fc998aa', '50feb110-75f9-4751-adb1-1a1e1cad770a', '5b610a70-6c8f-4a5d-94a4-38fd1c753a9d', '6cbbaa79-7a49-478a-b428-076a07eaa1e5', '71f495d1-0a2e-416e-8deb-038956b1578e', '742a2b04-e65c-405e-ae7d-3891b34cabdb', '804cb992-d1ab-4d00-a6d4-db8f089f1c69', '812c4720-9a56-45ad-8e68-787bb0b5990f', '822bdac3-4ffd-4efc-a47e-b62f00cd61ab', '86ed1cbd-4b6a-4b04-be24-c5dc65ff2586', '8774e9ef-b40b-4f2b-9206-374d761bd6db', '894c59e4-2c42-488f-af25-8cfdc4a87fab', '8c960e42-4602-49ae-bce1-ab31e515627c', '8f453dd9-eca4-4bb2-880a-52388aa5477e', '99d088a3-1d33-43a4-b598-93dc0836ad25', '9ce8c9e4-c768-4e65-a03f-95e1e3239ed8', 'a1bdc29b-0456-477f-8eb5-ef5852ad54a4', 'ab76454c-9601-48ed-a273-c4d9d0ae52f0', 'b5ec809b-a81d-4b64-a033-122e20c55fd5', 'be675a6b-0ad2-4dc8-88ef-3c5ff98edb9f', 'd4543edd-77ff-49ae-8932-229dec3d2bd1', 'd7fe2011-a268-4aa9-95ed-27719410c83d', 'e04942fc-4a99-4fef-9c88-944c643e5596', 'e26f3181-ef83-4ce6-8e11-e79f68a186f8', 'e58a220d-1356-41c9-9bab-c8709007b76e', 'f371104a-f528-4d0d-99dd-368fca5cdb6c', 'f76c4287-7004-4764-bc15-8b993e9cafbf', 'fec2c786-f673-48d0-8234-52ee51286d54']",SOFIA: Software and control flow integrity architecture,Computers & Security,2017
484,"When making decisions with the Analytic Network Process, coherency testing is an important step in the decision making process. Once an incoherent priority vector is identified it can either be costly or in some cases next to impossible to elicit new pairwise comparisons. Remarkably, there is useful information in the linking estimates that one may have already calculated and used in one of the approaches to measure the coherency of the Supermatrix. A dynamic clustering method is used to automatically identify a cluster of coherent linking estimates from which a new coherent priority vector can be calculated and used to replace the most incoherent priority vector. The decision maker can then accept or revise the proposed new and coherent priority vector. This process is repeated until the entire Supermatrix is coherent. This method can save decision makers valuable time and effort by using the information and relationships that already exist in a weighted Supermatrix that is sufficiently coherent. The method is initially motivated and demonstrated through a simple straightforward example. A group of conceptual charts and a figure provide a visual motivation and explanation of the method. A high level summary of the method is provided in a table before the method is presented in detail. Simulations demonstrate both the application and the robustness of the proposed method. Code is provided, as supplementary material, in the programming language R so the method can be easily applied by the decision maker.","['Idil Yavuz', 'Orrin Cooper']",2ccabe0d-8ca5-48b1-93d2-e15f8042d00d,0,"['29b11f39-ab27-4d04-800d-914ebaa7f6c7', '42d4bd60-7503-44db-9ae8-94c55a9fde6b', '453fd2da-b0cd-44dc-8e9d-31ee901379c8', '5b4ed0ae-78a1-4d52-8b62-33e70b023945', '5b7163b3-4bc3-43e9-875e-369582e340d5', '5ce867e9-d690-4bdc-8472-d6331197cbff', '6a9b089c-1f12-4128-8828-3d641c0e9ecf', '77929b7d-ce0d-420b-b1d1-ed2ab89b760c', '863923cc-68d3-43b0-8a86-900aab007a46', '90d2cb0e-0614-408e-803e-490f2f685b4f', 'cbf1ec9f-e694-43f5-a062-8c80f246b037', 'e4501e3a-4ac4-42b6-8e3c-2d5e78de369a']",A dynamic clustering method to improve the coherency of an ANP Supermatrix,Annals of Operations Research,2017
485,"Trees Outside Forests (TOF) represent a source of lignocellulosic biomass that has received increasing attention in the recent years. While some studies have already investigated the potential of TOF in Germany, a spatial explicit analysis, specifically for Baden-Wuerttemberg, is still lacking. We used a unique wall-to-wall airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) dataset combined with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to map and classify TOF of the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg (∼35.000 km2) in south-western Germany. Furthermore, from annual biomass potentials of TOF areas collected from available literature, we calculated the mean annual biomass supply for all TOF areas in Baden-Wuerttemberg. This combination of remote sensing-based classification and available literature resulted in a mean annual biomass supply between ∼490,000–730,000 t from TOF in Baden-Wuerttemberg. The classification congruence on three reference sites was very high (∼99%) using a simple filter technique applied to the LiDAR data and masking man-made objects using OSM data. In contrast, the available literature revealed a high variability of biomass potentials, supporting the demand for an inventory system. Still, the results demonstrate the applicability of LiDAR based vegetation mapping and the value of OSM data in Baden-Wuerttemberg to detect man-made objects.","['Joachim Maack', 'Marcus Lingenfelder', 'Christina Eilers', 'Thomas Smaltschinski', 'Holger Weinacker', 'Dirk Jaeger', 'Barbara Koch']",f3a61430-6080-40c4-9869-fd023932d9c8,0,['4383df8a-0912-4114-ac43-402f5c2eac59'],"Estimating the spatial distribution, extent and potential lignocellulosic biomass supply of Trees Outside Forests in Baden-Wuerttemberg using airborne LiDAR and OpenStreetMap data",International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2017

487,"Sinkholes are an unpredictable geohazard that endanger life and property in dolomitic terrains. Sinkholes are a significant threat in Gauteng, South Africa’s most populated and urbanized province. Small-scale surface subsidence is frequently present prior to the collapse of a sinkhole. Therefore, the presence of precursory surface deformation can be exploited to develop early warning systems. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) differential interferometry (DInSAR) is able to monitor small-scale surface deformation over large areas and can be used to detect and measure precursors to sinkhole development. This letter investigates the use of repeat-pass DInSAR to detect sinkhole precursors in the Gauteng province. Twenty stripmap acquisitions from TerraSAR-X were acquired over a full year. DInSAR results revealed the presence of three previously unknown deformation features, one of which could be confirmed by subsequent field investigations. Furthermore, a water supply pipeline ruptured six months after the initial observation. The detection of the deformation, therefore, provided a viable early warning to landowners who were unaware of the subsidence. Detected deformation features were between 40 and 100 m in diameter. The maximum displacement measured was 50 mm over 55 days. Despite the successful detection, seven sinkhole events occurred in the observation period, for which no deformation could be detected. The results indicate that high-resolution X-band interferometry is able to monitor dolomite-induced instability in an urban environment. However, considerations related to SAR interferometry and physical sinkhole properties need to be addressed before DInSAR can be used in an operational early warning system.","['Andre Theron', 'Jeanine Engelbrecht', 'Jaco Kemp', 'Waldo Kleynhans', 'Terrence Turnbull']",82d4c3b8-0682-47dc-8197-fa4c4c915849,0,"['15873ba0-2f6b-49d6-8afb-414528ecda09', '3f628f3f-3d36-4fba-ad18-9048f118f38b', '5d94be68-b199-4a8a-acdc-1ec3d3915386', '7385a1af-243a-4103-8dd1-60a3ebfaa106', 'ad43e3eb-48aa-405c-ace6-8a06dca88256']",Detection of Sinkhole Precursors Through SAR Interferometry: Radar and Geological Considerations,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
488,"An abstract, quantitative theory which connects elements of information —key ingredients in the cognitive proces—is developed. Seemingly unrelated results are thereby unified. As an indication of this, consider results in classical probabilistic information theory involving information projections and so-called Pythagorean inequalities. This has a certain resemblance to classical results in geometry bearing Pythagoras’ name. By appealing to the abstract theory presented here, you have a common point of reference for these results. In fact, the new theory provides a general framework for the treatment of a multitude of global optimization problems across a range of disciplines such as geometry, statistics and statistical physics.

489,"This work presents a new numerical solution approach to nonlinear constrained optimization problems based on a gradient flow reformulation. The proposed solution schemes use self-tuning penalty parameters where the updating of the penalty parameter is directly embedded in the system of ODEs used in the reformulation, and its growth rate is linked to the violation of the constraints and variable bounds. The convergence properties of these schemes are analyzed, and it is shown that they converge to a local minimum asymptotically. Numerical experiments using a set of test problems, ranging from a few to several hundred variables, show that the proposed schemes are robust and converge to feasible points and local minima. Moreover, results suggest that the GF formulations were able to find the optimal solution to problems where conventional NLP solvers fail, and in less integration steps and time compared to a previously reported GF formulation.","['Felipe Scott', 'Raúl Conejeros', 'Vassilios S.

490,"Traffic measurement and monitoring are critical for many network applications, for example, bandwidth management and detecting security threats such as DoS (Denial of Service) attacks. In these cases, traffic is usually modeled as a collection of flows. One central problem is to identify those frequent flows, which account for a large percentage of total traffic, or whose frequency exceeds the user-specified threshold. In this paper, we describe a novel data structure called the probabilistic Bloom filter (PBF), which extends the classical Bloom filter into probabilistic direction, so that it can effectively estimate flows' frequencies, and identify frequent flows. We analyze the performance, tradeoffs, and capacity of this data structure, and investigate how to calibrate this data structure's parameters. We further develop one extension of the PBF for dynamic data stream needs. We implement our PBF on GPUs to gain more time efficiency. By testing with real network traces collected from a backbone router, we demonstrate that our method can keep track of flows' frequencies with adjustable accuracy, so that frequent flows can be identified with constant computational time complexity and low memory overhead.","['Sisi Xiong', 'Yanjun Yao', 'Michael W.

491,"To express the multi-relation in complex dataset, proposed a fast visualization method based on the continuous Catmull–Rom curve. The method expresses the entity data and the taxonomic relation in dataset using the hypergraph. The nodes are designed to represent the entity data in dataset. The hyperedge is introduced to link all the relative nodes in one multi-relation. The hyperedge can be visualized by the curve style or the regional style according to different requirements. The nodes in one hyperedge are linked by a continuous curve in curve style, while all the nodes are surrounded by one closed region in regional style. The Catmull–Rom algorithm is adopted to produce the continuous curve between the adjacent nodes in curve style. The nodes are regarded as the control points in the interpolating processing of Catmull–Rom algorithm. The peripheral points are obtained by extending along the tendency line of the hyperedge in regional style. The closed curve connecting these peripheral points forms a closed region expressing the hyperedge. The color selected to stain the hyperedge based on color wheel. The selected colors for each hyperedge can maximize the visual differentiation in the processing of coloring each hyperedge. The experimental results denoted that the method can achieve the intuitive and accurate expression for the multi-relation in complex dataset. The method can visualize the common scale dataset the in real time.","['Hui Li', 'Hongqian Chen', 'Qin He', 'Liyi Ma', 'Shuang Dong']",7945e1e9-1c58-4487-8120-0d40ecfd7cc7,0,"['058df0d8-0d27-4318-bcf2-f888558b4bb5', '28090e80-96c0-45ce-98fa-6194983f9721', '60c7e998-7727-4143-871a-90c6b748fd27', 'b0430695-edd4-4110-8664-b295f98786ed', 'c5d18407-394f-4ade-be5d-5eb35037cd67', 'c797558d-2caa-456d-bbc1-30bf054f4d3b', 'd44a8420-794c-4ef9-8531-46a4871bcb50']",A visualization method for multi-relation in dataset,Cluster Computing,2017
492,"In this paper, we focus on a critical aspect of work in organizations: using information in work tasks which is provided by information systems (IS) such as enterprise content management (ECM) systems. Our study based on the IS success model, 34 interviews, and an empirical study of 247 ECM system users at a financial service provider indicates that it is appropriate to differentiate between contextual and representational information quality as two information quality dimensions. Furthermore, we reveal that in addition to system quality, the two information quality dimensions are important in determining end-user satisfaction, which in turn influences the manifestation of workarounds. Our study also finds that employees using workarounds to avoid an ECM system implemented several years is negatively related to individual net benefits of the ECM system. Hence, we conclude that when investigating large-scale IS such as ECM systems, it is important to differentiate among information quality dimensions to more deeply understand end-user satisfaction and the resulting manifestation of workarounds. Moreover, this research guides organizations in implementing the most appropriate countermeasures based on the importance of either contextual or representational information quality.","['Sven Laumer', 'Christian Maier', 'Tim Weitzel']",20e07f1e-9647-40d4-81fb-b66549ad9cc7,0,"['004050d0-c5b4-4721-bd2c-f13b8ca8dcb5', '01119adb-58b8-42ed-a8ac-81a754a5c8ca', '0929b7ff-b2d4-4d6e-9f2c-00a6d1f31389', '0ec0343a-283f-42b6-8ca1-dee7d326bd1e', '0ffbba6a-4711-4e10-ad37-358bd8cb6873', '121e1aab-892c-4651-9ec6-d105a58c4b84', '1567033a-4be4-4080-becf-8644a746234d', '1ca85f36-e55c-4153-8335-23661bdf1e60', '1d43ecb6-6cca-40d5-968c-fb51dd83e6cf', '20437c08-05ed-4839-b901-dfde6d889f3b', '21de3c84-d4ca-4f7c-9498-54ce6a1dc14b', '31c97d63-f96c-4895-b9a0-9e4b578aaea2', '337dcc3d-f453-48a0-aec4-e0550ed38bbf', '379bb9ef-4dd7-4a16-b55e-fc6133c17a99', '3a2ee782-09ec-4f30-866a-8cc792ec64bd', '3c41b7ee-0fb9-4588-8e66-33ab12da3fe8', '3ef084b0-2b2b-4c9d-b8cb-6b82879db4ec', '43bda499-178e-41f2-8afd-125c9a6c4484', '440c7fe2-014f-42a5-a60a-a7126ac6818a', '4bdb9dbb-cd75-4044-afc6-6893d2963ee1', '4e3f3103-5ad7-4000-8f15-de77d72fffe6', '51731a29-01e3-4eb0-aacd-d08e9c0ba798', '5c62d59a-6e62-4ab1-8066-854cb969ddad', '62979546-d674-432e-adbb-2f8abd0522e2', '633d48bc-d0c2-4de0-a5eb-384398fdd3b5', '6444de4d-60aa-407d-919b-df84ebc08450', '64641ce7-77c7-4c9a-97f7-a331d26848e4', '65cb2680-b7e1-40da-ab5b-fa95a34a1798', '65def174-0b2c-416a-bedc-a09056ab0ba7', '67ff3507-8d67-4f78-aa89-14c4cae04d4c', '7976c926-86c4-4e9b-a7e6-4266ac4977f7', '7da47e87-51e0-46ed-815d-2c524bcf711c', '82608177-46f7-47ef-8546-c94659786e77', '840b8bee-a2b8-4697-a190-705c79127f12', '900e5460-9bf1-4fc9-a709-48f16cad4b77', '9697c1b3-a7dc-49e6-a54f-f4d9a7000a85', '981e33cc-fbfa-421d-a50e-43df60844792', '9b19a579-dc25-4dc8-8139-fd9f264983ac', 'a3c7e85a-136f-4fb1-a535-c1625b896b67', 'a8c4abdd-4230-467b-83c4-ea361adadc9c', 'aaaad2aa-7899-4382-9912-21a650e2a3f6', 'ac8ec758-7cb3-4cc3-b28e-f95deac253c5', 'adefbb48-ec23-4d45-93b1-613c7b9c440f', 'af07321c-8f73-4db9-aeb3-eaead3b9ea16', 'b2c72ea3-1704-4a70-b2ab-3bbcedeabdee', 'b53b3d2b-6424-4b3e-8761-13f367be9612', 'b541380f-8e36-4fd8-91b3-04cf1f8d2736', 'b56c2bd3-9a37-4beb-8c74-3f2ba8c3eb4b', 'b754053d-b99f-4eaf-a827-911c750601f2', 'bbd4bdae-39f7-4f17-947e-067190f6a367', 'bc3ffb0f-5e34-451c-993c-a6311e76b859', 'c2c284a9-e867-475e-be1f-edc8a8d3472d', 'c3c937c5-d761-4614-b00d-158be254bcce', 'c7868233-3d99-472b-9a80-187cd1c34dca', 'ca48d434-3b5d-4c23-829d-bf1fb8c4afcd', 'd63abf70-86f4-47ba-8ff4-55b878bc5860', 'dd522f83-7885-4dd7-9464-cf4d8b77765c', 'df65f292-854d-40c1-9106-bdf4c96e1460', 'e619078e-03e9-413c-b001-2e5375020ec4', 'e6a821d6-4c60-4a2e-8c11-14cecff442b7', 'f0fef4a6-0a6b-442a-80b1-ef2f848013c5', 'f67b5d4c-396b-4aa5-9486-ae9e07503720', 'f77240e7-7bff-4496-907b-f31675cc9b90', 'f815d278-c45f-4d3f-be4a-6a724ba0536c', 'fa069cc1-2f92-4bf3-aaa5-453f485d4579']","Information quality, user satisfaction, and the manifestation of workarounds: a qualitative and quantitative study of enterprise content management system users",European Journal of Information Systems,2017
493,"A substantial amount of datasets stored for various applications are often high dimensional with redundant and irrelevant features. Processing and analysing data under such circumstances is time consuming and makes it difficult to obtain efficient predictive models. There is a strong need to carry out analyses for high dimensional data in some lower dimensions, and one approach to achieve this is through feature selection. This paper presents a new relevancy-redundancy approach, called the maximum relevance–minimum multicollinearity (MRmMC) method, for feature selection and ranking, which can overcome some shortcomings of existing criteria. In the proposed method, relevant features are measured by correlation characteristics based on conditional variance while redundancy elimination is achieved according to multiple correlation assessment using an orthogonal projection scheme. A series of experiments were conducted on eight datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and results show that the proposed method performed reasonably well for feature subset selection.","['Azlyna Senawi', 'Hua-Liang Wei', 'S.A.

494,"Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a novel biological-inspired optimization algorithm, which has many advantages compared with other optimization algorithm, such as less control parameters, great global optimization ability and easy to carry out. It has proven to be more effective than some evolutionary algorithms (EAs), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) when testing on both benchmark functions and real issues. ABC, however, its solution search equation is poor at exploitation. For overcoming this insufficiency, two new solution search equations are proposed in this paper. They apply random solutions to take the place of the current solution as base vector in order to get more useful information. Exploitation is further improved on the basis of enhancing exploration by utilizing the information of the current best solution. In addition, the information of objective function value is introduced, which makes it possible to adjust the step-size adaptively. Owing to their respective characteristics, the new solution search equations are combined to construct an adaptive algorithm called MTABC. The methods our proposed balance the exploration and exploitation of ABC without forcing severe extra overhead in respect of function evaluations. The performance of the MTABC algorithm is extensively judged on a set of 20 basic functions and a set of 10 shifted or rotated functions, and is compared favorably with other improved ABCs and several state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a higher convergence speed and better search ability for almost all functions.","['Xiaoyu Song', 'Qifeng Yan', 'Ming Zhao']",f3251cde-42c2-4bcb-b12a-db8d91534444,0,"['0485a04c-c246-4692-88fe-f668b527ae31', '09d94653-0ba4-41f8-854a-f55a41192da3', '1799df4d-30e8-4d03-b652-2ab36f096e23', '17b8bac6-7e0d-4784-ac0b-a728dbbdda01', '1a48f00b-bc9e-40aa-978a-fa06d511bb8b', '2a944f00-eff6-48ed-bd1e-3b82172060fb', '2ab7414f-4327-4539-902c-6be86947d1fb', '2d24da8c-9499-4b03-858b-a65d66ca1a20', '30d80e91-edfa-44ff-acd2-2e092c5a1ca0', '421b4cf0-0e39-4cd0-9eaf-4d6687d574aa', '5d428a5d-0c2d-4350-8bbc-2c98919c8ab0', '7141d587-ec43-4c00-b453-4bb37b1e6e07', '7462486e-e196-4fb3-ab77-f551b0460ab9', '76b6060b-7df5-46fb-b1dc-3de597c2ec3c', '78391043-7872-4ff6-a886-bb7c6683b13b', '8b55f725-e0e4-4674-8f8e-098634628b58', '8beac75e-7f81-4852-9fde-711122124397', '8e950bce-7269-422d-af84-1cff99a323c3', '92042db2-4aa5-4ac1-8c6b-5209f8707997', '96cddc57-562d-4efa-a8af-66b46fd92e08', '9e6f658f-4b60-43be-8bf1-0599b855cf2d', 'a0584134-02e5-4d03-a1c2-c8d608d0e896', 'a2a0d7ee-8fa9-46fe-9e0b-a2f3702e9af4', 'a30fae74-ea32-4a82-8cb1-523c1987010c', 'a698501a-4909-41a9-8abd-bc78ae0f3a5f', 'b4a2aa79-2516-43eb-9a6f-84b011f18dd4', 'bc3ec25b-ed43-41e9-94ea-336646b82161', 'bcd3c328-98c6-4690-a2bb-81fc57458f9d', 'c3680d94-5dda-45c9-bb8b-0ed010b79109', 'c808749a-b849-4bb8-9423-ca901f9c55ee', 'de1a02eb-0a29-4c8a-bfaa-bcc630ab9905', 'e1f5f896-68e3-429c-8012-c6d395c8a10a', 'e4b468aa-2b23-4229-8872-f9286464a19f', 'e6bdc8ae-c041-4432-b7e2-9e45bdf900e8', 'e7a9dc3b-ef63-4d3a-b91d-8c388eb38791', 'f2f10514-c1f6-4acb-ab02-ade81ada0f97', 'f53162f2-504f-4527-b681-17dbe1a1c5a5', 'fb89a93c-3fb9-491a-8295-a5a14b08ae6c']",An adaptive artificial bee colony algorithm based on objective function value information,Applied Soft Computing,2017
495,"All of the quantitative landslide susceptibility mapping (QLSM) methods requires two basic data types, namely, landslide inventory and factors that influence landslide occurrence (landslide influencing factors, LIF). Depending on type of landslides, nature of triggers and LIF, accuracy of the QLSM methods differs. Moreover, how to balance the number of 0 (nonoccurrence) and 1 (occurrence) in the training set obtained from the landslide inventory and how to select which one of the 1's and 0's to be included in QLSM models play critical role in the accuracy of the QLSM. Although performance of various QLSM methods is largely investigated in the literature, the challenge of training set construction is not adequately investigated for the QLSM methods. In order to tackle this challenge, in this study three different training set selection strategies along with the original data set is used for testing the performance of three different regression methods namely Logistic Regression (LR), Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) and Fuzzy Logistic Regression (FLR). The first sampling strategy is proportional random sampling (PRS), which takes into account a weighted selection of landslide occurrences in the sample set. The second method, namely non-selective nearby sampling (NNS), includes randomly selected sites and their surrounding neighboring points at certain preselected distances to include the impact of clustering. Selective nearby sampling (SNS) is the third method, which concentrates on the group of 1's and their surrounding neighborhood. A randomly selected group of landslide sites and their neighborhood are considered in the analyses similar to NNS parameters. It is found that LR-PRS, FLR-PRS and BLR-Whole Data set-ups, with order, yield the best fits among the other alternatives. The results indicate that in QLSM based on regression models, avoidance of spatial correlation in the data set is critical for the model's performance.","['Arzu Erener', 'A. Abdullah Sivas', 'A.

497,"Research on cyberbullying has been steadily growing among scholars who endeavor to understand when and under what conditions it occurs. This study utilizes general aggression theory to contribute to a better theoretical understanding of the confluence of inputs that goes into decision-making involving cyberbullying perpetration. Young adult college students were surveyed to examine whether person-specific inputs, including trait verbal aggression, Internet self-efficacy, and social skills, contribute to cyberbullying perpetration. Results indicated that verbal aggression was consistently positively associated with cyberbullying perpetration. Further analysis revealed that the interaction between verbal aggressiveness and social skills on cyberbullying perpetration depended on one's level of Internet self-efficacy. At low levels of Internet self-efficacy, trait aggressiveness and social skills do little to inform cyberbullying perpetration; however, participants with high Internet self-efficacy and high trait verbal aggressiveness are less likely to send hurtful or embarrassing messages over the Internet or mobile technologies as their social skills grow. Contributions to theory and practice are discussed.","['Matthew W. Savage', 'Robert S.

498,"In this paper, an economic ordered quantity (EOQ) model, specifically for a newly launched product has been developed with selling price, customers’ credit period and customers’ credit amount induced demand under three levels of partial trade credit policy, where a supplier, a wholesaler and a retailer offer some credit periods on some fraction of the total purchased amount to the wholesaler, the retailer and the customer respectively. Also, here it is assumed that the retailer obtained a quantity discount from the wholesaler on purchased units above a certain level. In addition, the wholesaler and the retailer both enjoy freight charge discount according to the ordered quantity. Retailer introduces a promotional cost to increase the base demand of the item. Objective of this investigation is to maximize the profit of the retailer as well as the wholesaler. It is established that if the wholesaler contributes some portion of the promotional cost then individual profits as well as the joint profit increases. Due to the uncertainty and vagueness of different inventory costs, the proposed model is also discussed in fuzzy and rough environments. Combining the features of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA) a hybrid algorithm named Particle Swarm-Simulated Annealing (PSSA) is developed to find the most appropriate strategies for the proposed model. Efficiency of this algorithm is tested and compared with PSO and genetic algorithm (GA) for a set of benchmark test problems. The model is illustrated with numerical examples and some managerial insights are outlined.","['Prasenjit Pramanik', 'Manas Kumar Maiti', 'Manoranjan Maiti']",801832e2-d56d-41ff-af62-b47149aee1e6,0,"['0690b535-f9a0-4184-9ddc-78e431576ac8', '24e53546-5483-411d-819e-509a62e2b96b', '274023c8-9716-47c3-a7e0-7b0f3b1ab62f', '294b08b9-976c-4131-8330-96cd44f78902', '2b8d7a0d-9ebc-43f4-83ec-b9346109c45e', '2ca4579f-1a38-4366-8456-d8c2a45a3511', '6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3', '6b372a10-a83e-48f7-a387-9a54e06f5a87', '755d4fd3-de00-4f2c-8397-b27ac4e344eb', '7bc6a2d8-90e6-4731-9347-924fc4a59b16', '87f2c29a-86cc-4030-a2bc-34dddc2e33a7', '9b80e173-2d0d-4e2d-8cd0-0fcfe230fd81', 'a18f1ef3-e3f4-4ae2-8ee3-c53831890b8e', 'a30fa127-bb3e-41ff-91c9-e7c1ba31bff2', 'a4589cfe-15e7-4c34-9349-d002d1d2c9df', 'c4bb922d-9e5d-4a59-aead-78ad66dde12c', 'ca881859-01f6-4466-bcc7-0cc86d1b44f0', 'ccd34380-5c10-4bc8-92fd-599ed035fef4', 'df8539ab-68d9-47e2-9caa-c53cf83bd90d', 'e6464ae8-1188-4b6b-9298-19bfe46bef70']",Three level partial trade credit with promotional cost sharing,Applied Soft Computing,2017
499,"Random forests are a popular method in many fields since they can be successfully applied to complex data, with a small sample size, complex interactions and correlations, mixed type predictors, etc. Furthermore, they provide variable importance measures that aid qualitative interpretation and also the selection of relevant predictors. However, most of these measures rely on the choice of a performance measure. But measures of prediction performance are not unique or there is not even a clear definition, as in the case of multivariate response random forests. A new alternative importance measure, called Intervention in Prediction Measure, is investigated. It depends on the structure of the trees, without depending on performance measures. It is compared with other well-known variable importance measures in different contexts, such as a classification problem with variables of different types, another classification problem with correlated predictor variables, and problems with multivariate responses and predictors of different types. Several simulation studies are carried out, showing the new measure to be very competitive. In addition, it is applied in two well-known bioinformatics applications previously used in other papers. Improvements in performance are also provided for these applications by the use of this new measure. This new measure is expressed as a percentage, which makes it attractive in terms of interpretability. It can be used with new observations. It can be defined globally, for each class (in a classification problem) and case-wise. It can easily be computed for any kind of response, including multivariate responses. Furthermore, it can be used with any algorithm employed to grow each individual tree.

502,"We develop an algorithm for the three dimensional simulation of the dynamics of soft objects (drops, capsules, vesicles) under creeping flow conditions. Loop elements are used to describe the shape of the soft objects. This surface representation is used both for membrane solver based on finite element method (FEM) and for the fluid solver based on the boundary element method (BEM). This isogeometric analysis of the low Reynolds fluid-structure interaction problem is then coupled to high-order explicit time stepping or second-order implicit time stepping algorithm.

503,"The paper devises a family of leptokurtic bell-shaped distributions which is based on the hyperbolic secant raised to a positive power, and bridges the Laplace and Gaussian laws on asymptotic arguments. Moment and cumulant generating functions are then derived and represented in terms of polygamma functions. The behaviour of shape parameters, namely kurtosis and entropy, is investigated. In addition, Gram–Charlier-type (GCT) expansions, based on the aforementioned distributions and their orthogonal polynomials, are specified, and an operational criterion is provided to meet modelling requirements in a possibly severe kurtosis and skewness environment. The role played by entropy within the kurtosis ranges of GCT expansions is also examined.","['Mario Faliva', 'Maria Zoia']",a1eedc9a-2fc8-48fc-9afe-dae691440c17,0,[],"A Distribution Family Bridging the Gaussian and the Laplace Laws, Gram–Charlier Expansions, Kurtosis Behaviour, and Entropy Features",Entropy,2017
504,"One important, however, poorly understood, concept of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is that of hot, cold, and neutral nature of its bioactive principles. To advance the field, in this study, we analyzed compound–nature pairs from TCM on a large scale (>23 000 structures) via chemical space visualizations to understand its physicochemical domain and in silico target prediction to understand differences related to their modes-of-action (MoA) against proteins. We found that overall TCM natures spread into different subclusters with specific molecular patterns, as opposed to forming coherent global groups. Compounds associated with cold nature had a lower clogP and contain more aliphatic rings than the other groups and were found to control detoxification, heat-clearing, heart development processes, and have sedative function, associated with “Mental and behavioural disorders” diseases.

505,"Abstract#R##N#An unusual pericyclic process that involves the intermolecular transfer of thiozone (S3) is computationally described. The process can be considered as a special case of double group transfer reaction whereby the two migrating groups are connected to the same substituent, taking place in a concerted manner via transition states featuring two five-membered C2S3 rings fused together. Analysis of the aromaticity at the TS geometries by computing NICS values at the (3,+1) RCPS as well as ACID calculations confirms the aromatic character of each C2S3 ring, thus resulting in bicyclically delocalized aromatic structures. The free energy barriers for the transfer of S3 are relatively similar (40–50 kcal mol−1) to those computed for typical double H group transfer reactions. The similarities and differences between these processes have been further analysed by applying ASM–EDA and NBO approaches to the model reactions between ethene and ethane, and ethene and 1,2,3-trithiolane. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",['Andrés G.

506,"Accurate and timely traffic flow forecasting is critical for the successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems. However, it is quite challenging to develop an efficient and robust forecasting model due to the inherent randomness and large variations of traffic flow. Recently, the stacked autoencoder has been proven promising for traffic flow forecasting but still exists some drawbacks in certain conditions. In this paper, a training samples replication strategy is introduced to train a series of stacked autoencoders and an adaptive boosting scheme is proposed to ensemble the trained stacked autoencoders to improve the accuracy of traffic flow forecasting. Furthermore, sufficient experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposal.","['Teng Zhou', 'Guoqiang Han', 'Xuemiao Xu', 'Zhizhe Lin', 'Chu Han', 'Yuchang Huang', 'Jing Qin']",392fd773-0c4e-4b3a-9b8b-ab167388534e,0,"['051956bb-f64b-4fdb-87f8-3e2868b8b5d8', '0861baf0-c2ef-4f2c-b266-35e806edf97d', '0a61b70a-0d1c-40d4-ba94-4dfaeb96ede6', '1b60b898-5925-4706-8f24-2174abd88d9a', '24d6a753-8a73-407e-9ae3-993670a30b08', '25c898ff-83f0-4490-a2fb-e8fc04255086', '2683adcb-1c20-4c7b-95a2-e0abb6edab53', '2b0a5477-0fc7-4763-b373-ad6e0ed88ec1', '34f89ca7-8ab5-4119-8fe6-4f307e00df7c', '3715c870-6569-4d20-8797-af8569e5fde5', '69b2096d-7f0c-4d2a-859a-1acb81c49349', '78e84e82-2113-4c7a-9c39-9e9caf646493', '809ac872-09f9-455a-adbe-23f9fc59866e', '838cf921-6899-4e8a-bec9-d47074e3a0a0', '84806dbe-fa0e-47c0-b1f2-00fb2eed25a7', '8e0b40ee-428e-4561-bc8e-a6d6809abe39', '92bfb792-9959-4b63-9d35-1d29b22ec37b', '9f646092-2cb2-4f28-a414-6be9a8b85e5d', 'aa70d058-ba2d-409f-a20e-fcf8239a069e', 'ab8979d2-af7e-4617-9f23-e60c91ee4869', 'b617ec60-9c4d-4839-a4fc-f2afa35d1d01', 'bd1a4e94-beef-4b34-83d1-4a548072e0ee', 'bff1945c-7b01-4b42-b6c4-1e3601c18a6b', 'e09b73e8-26e8-4c34-bfb1-9cdb6f3e6fbb', 'e407acd7-dfcf-4ee8-9140-6726c01abf4e', 'eaf07346-dffa-4ed8-a2a8-e5d9fba20d65', 'f093822b-7909-4f78-8300-adcd7a18263c', 'f8c63e6d-ee92-48e7-9386-c5fe425c072b', 'fb3f627f-e054-403a-b9cd-6ac77180a0c7']",δ-agree AdaBoost stacked autoencoder for short-term traffic flow forecasting,Neurocomputing,2017
507,"In previous work, we have assessed the structural similarities between marketed drugs (‘drugs’) and endogenous natural human metabolites (‘metabolites’ or ‘endogenites’), using ‘fingerprint’ methods in common use, and the Tanimoto and Tversky similarity metrics, finding that the fingerprint encoding used had a dramatic effect on the apparent similarities observed. By contrast, the maximal common substructure (MCS), when the means of determining it is fixed, is a means of determining similarities that is largely independent of the fingerprints, and also has a clear chemical meaning. We here explored the utility of the MCS and metrics derived therefrom. In many cases, a shared scaffold helps cluster drugs and endogenites, and gives insight into enzymes (in particular transporters) that they both share. Tanimoto and Tversky similarities based on the MCS tend to be smaller than those based on the MACCS fingerprint-type encoding, though the converse is also true for a significant fraction of the comparisons. While no single molecular descriptor can account for these differences, a machine learning-based analysis of the nature of the differences (MACCS_Tanimoto vs MCS_Tversky) shows that they are indeed deterministic, although the features that are used in the model to account for this vary greatly with each individual drug. The extent of its utility and interpretability vary with the drug of interest, implying that while MCS is neither ‘better’ nor ‘worse’ for every drug–endogenite comparison, it is sufficiently different to be of value. The overall conclusion is thus that the use of the MCS provides an additional and valuable strategy for understanding the structural basis for similarities between synthetic, marketed drugs and natural intermediary metabolites.","['Steve O’Hagan', 'Douglas B.

It allows mobile users to communicate using SMS and phone calls, manage billing for operators and much more.

Deregulation and migration to IP have made SS7 vulnerable to serious attacks such as location tracking of subscribers, interception of calls and SMS, fraud, and denial of services. Unfortunately, current protection measures such as firewalls, filters, and blacklists are not able to provide adequate protection of SS7.

In particular, we propose a methodology to classify name usage patterns through a supervised classification task and show that different classes are robust (across datasets) and exhibit significantly different properties. We show that the collaboration network structure emerging around nodes corresponding to ambiguous names from different name usage patterns have strikingly different characteristics, such as their common neighborhood and degree evolution.

513,"The classification of samples on a molecular level has manifold applications, from patient classification regarding cancer treatment to phylogenetics for identifying evolutionary relationships between species. Modern methods employ the alignment of DNA or amino acid sequences, mostly not genome-wide but only on selected parts of the genome. Recently proteomics-based approaches have become popular. An established method for the identification of peptides and proteins is liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). First, protein sequences from MS/MS spectra are identified by means of database searches, given samples with known genome-wide sequence information, then sequence based methods are applied. Alternatively, de novo peptide sequencing algorithms annotate MS/MS spectra and deduce peptide/protein information without a database. A newer approach independent of additional information is to directly compare unidentified tandem mass spectra. The challenge then is to compute the distance between pairwise MS/MS runs consisting of thousands of spectra. We present DISMS2, a new algorithm to calculate proteome-wide distances directly from MS/MS data, extending the algorithm compareMS2, an approach that also uses a spectral comparison pipeline. Our new more flexible algorithm, DISMS2, allows for the choice of the spectrum distance measure and includes different spectra preprocessing and filtering steps that can be tailored to specific situations by parameter optimization. DISMS2 performs well for samples from species with and without database annotation and thus has clear advantages over methods that are purely based on database search.","['Vera Rieder', 'Bernhard Blank-Landeshammer', 'Marleen Stuhr', 'Tilman Schell', 'Karsten Biß', 'Laxmikanth Kollipara', 'Achim Meyer', 'Markus Pfenninger', 'Hildegard Westphal', 'Albert Sickmann', 'Jörg Rahnenführer']",d25dac47-dd6d-4308-8447-048f6eba52d6,0,"['31267c6e-d792-4ed5-afec-8f982a6cdeba', '8575af03-9519-4d5b-a80e-2f21f349d646']",DISMS2: A flexible algorithm for direct proteome- wide distance calculation of LC-MS/MS runs,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
514,"We report on the design and results of an experiment investigating factors influencing Slater's Plausibility Illusion (Psi) in virtual environments (VEs). Slater proposed Psi and Place Illusion (PI) as orthogonal components of virtual experience which contribute to realistic response in a VE. PI corresponds to the traditional conception of presence as “being there,” so there exists a substantial body of previous research relating to PI, but very little relating to Psi. We developed this experiment to investigate the components of plausibility illusion using subjective matching techniques similar to those used in color science. Twenty-one participants each experienced a scenario with the highest level of coherence (the extent to which a scenario matches user expectations and is internally consistent), then in eight different trials chose transitions from lower-coherence to higher-coherence scenarios with the goal of matching the level of Psi they felt in the highest-coherence scenario. At each transition, participants could change one of the following coherence characteristics: the behavior of the other virtual humans in the environment, the behavior of their own body, the physical behavior of objects, or the appearance of the environment. Participants tended to choose improvements to the virtual body before any other improvements. This indicates that having an accurate and well-behaved representation of oneself in the virtual environment is the most important contributing factor to Psi. This study is the first to our knowledge to focus specifically on coherence factors in virtual environments.","['Richard Skarbez', 'Solene Neyret', 'Frederick P. Brooks', 'Mel Slater', 'Mary C.

515,"We present a multilinear algorithm to automatically establish dense point-to-point correspondence over an arbitrarily large number of population specific 3D faces across identities, facial expressions and poses. The algorithm is initialized with a subset of anthropometric landmarks detected by our proposed Deep Landmark Identification Network which is trained on synthetic images. The landmarks are used to segment the 3D face into Voronoi regions by evolving geodesic level set curves. Exploiting the intrinsic features of these regions, we extract discriminative keypoints on the facial manifold to elastically match the regions across faces for establishing dense correspondence. Finally, we generate a Region based 3D Deformable Model which is fitted to unseen faces to transfer the correspondences. We evaluate our algorithm on the tasks of facial landmark detection and recognition using two benchmark datasets.

517,"Semantic segmentation gives a meaningful class label to every pixel in an image. It enables intelligent devices to understand the scene and has received sufficient attention during recent years. Traditional imaging systems always apply their methods on RGB, RGB-D or even RGB combined with geometric information. However, for outdoor applications, strong reflection or poor illumination appears to reduce the visualization of the real shape or texture of the objects, thus limiting the performance of semantic segmentation algorithms. To tackle this problem, this paper adopts polarization imaging as it can provide complementary information by describing some imperceptible light properties, which varies from different materials. For acceleration, SLIC superpixel segmentation is used to speed up the system. HOG and LBP features are extracted from both color and polarization images. After quantization using visual codebooks, Joint Boosting classifier is trained to label each pixel based on the quantized features. The proposed method was evaluated both on Day-set and Dusk-set. The experimental results show that using polarization setup can provide complementary information to improve the semantic segmentation accuracy. Especially, a large improvement on Dusk-set shows its capacity for intelligent vehicle applications under dark illumination condition.","['Fan Wang', 'Samia Ainouz', 'Chunfeng Lian', 'Abdelaziz Bensrhair']",1e38753b-dda0-4b15-8559-190c0b3aced8,50,"['0b68638f-70a8-49a5-8215-462c173b535f', '10aeabc2-0193-4cf1-b9c0-2693b92a4c68', '1c70fc06-535a-4afc-80b0-4ef8808ddfdb', '225a875e-a605-4178-ae5b-2221111940af', '32a53bab-1ede-4869-98ad-d2ff0c1e3367', '34eb48c3-2285-465d-aa5e-3256a981d068', '4b8961cc-93b3-449d-8f7c-e7ff6dda6720', '4b9c17d1-9a08-48a2-95e0-47d3d4452a96', '4fe58138-5eb0-41f5-9cb2-38cd36123b14', '6018a516-8149-4bce-bc33-5449d86e58c2', '725ff5fd-76fe-41b4-b50d-00405a51ac27', '9fa55b0f-eaa6-4c59-b6e5-77e5f1a406f0', 'a21dacb2-3e91-47b2-9e02-4af77eb075d3', 'c1e404b0-365b-4aa6-9e0d-b6e7d3d7f478', 'dbb85ce4-27e2-49bf-8202-7eb6deb6efb5', 'dd83785a-dd19-41e3-9b25-ebabbd48d336', 'e2204e92-e6dc-4884-9bbc-200029491fc7', 'fc4a70a7-80c5-43c8-a68f-0a72a46ecce8']",Multimodality semantic segmentation based on polarization and color images,Neurocomputing,2017
518,"Decomposing a system into subsystems is essential to the design of large software systems. Traditionally, it is performed intuitively without rigorously analyzing the system model. This makes it difficult to check the decomposition correctness, and risks creating subsystems that are either too tightly coupled or not cohesive enough. An aggravating factor is that traditionally classes are the atomic design units. In many cases, however, the same classes play a role in more than one subsystem, and partitioning them unbroken among the subsystems may increase coupling and reduce cohesion. We present an analytical approach that enables reasoning about early exploration of decomposition alternatives. In addition, we describe a visual notation for diagramming the composition of subsystems, and an automatic technique for suggesting good decompositions. A key to our approach is that individual relations, not classes, are the atomic design units. We illustrate the approach with examples and demonstrate its effectiveness on a commercial system.

519,"Identification of falls while performing normal activities of daily living (ADL) is important to ensure personal safety and well-being. However, falling is a short term activity that occurs rarely and infrequently. This poses a challenge for traditional supervised classification algorithms, because there may be very little training data for falls (or none at all) to build generalizable models for falls. This paper proposes an approach for the identification of falls using a wearable device in the absence of training data for falls but with plentiful data for normal ADL. We propose three ‘X-Factor’ Hidden Markov Model (XHMMs) approaches. The XHMMs have ‘inflated’ output covariances (observation models). To estimate the inflated covariances, we propose a novel cross validation method to remove ‘outliers’ from the normal ADL that serves as proxies for the unseen falls and allow learning the XHMMs using only normal activities. We tested the proposed XHMM approaches on two activity recognition datasets and show high detection rates for falls in the absence of fall-specific training data. We show that the traditional method of choosing threshold based on maximum of negative of log-likelihood to identify unseen falls is ill-posed for this problem. We also show that supervised classification methods perform poorly when very limited fall data is available during the training phase.","['Shehroz S.

The difficulty for non-excavation pipeline detection is how to separate its magnetic anomalies from remote magnetic signals.

522,"Image restoration is a fundamental problem in the field of image processing. The key objective of image restoration is to recover clean images from images degraded by noise and blur. Recently, a family of new statistical techniques called variational Bayes (VB) has been introduced to image restoration, which enables us to automatically tune parameters that control restoration. While information from one image is often insufficient for high-quality restoration, however, current state-of-the-art methods of image restoration via VB approaches use only a single-degraded image to recover a clean image. In this paper, we propose a novel method of multiframe image restoration via a VB approach, which can achieve higher image quality while tuning parameters automatically. Given multiple degraded images, this method jointly estimates a clean image and other parameters, including an image warping parameter introduced for the use of multiple images, through Bayesian inference that we enable by making full use of VB techniques. Through various experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our multiframe method by comparing it with single-frame one, and also show the advantages of our VB approach over non-VB approaches.","['Motoharu Sonogashira', 'Takuya Funatomi', 'Masaaki Iiyama', 'Michihiko Minoh']",22bab9f7-f0ee-46ac-8ad3-b107e4717efe,0,"['03607fca-3851-4404-8b16-bd19cfd3b5f6', '09bb9934-81b8-4b9d-a951-f2fed4067ae7', '0a1dc08e-2807-4192-b98e-97335aad97cf', '0f18aea7-3634-44e1-b785-8a8078ae2f79', '1160ac24-de80-4787-beea-ec3c87b04720', '13fad487-e171-4cf3-b938-a3e190adfcc0', '1646cb16-63d3-4e95-9361-a349a747211c', '224c3f35-56ee-4500-9e69-71cb5674535e', '28d07127-cef3-4b58-8e34-3003ac4d0e81', '2b277055-1fcc-4d35-b704-b02fe954ebaa', '34d4e37b-e575-4316-847b-d8a661b51473', '37f6f6e1-d8ec-4ace-9a38-b8bc873d438c', '4142eeba-ef3a-4aa4-98e5-250bc3e335fb', '4ac8622a-4f7f-42b7-9d35-fa6383b2a29f', '50718871-ae8c-4ff0-abb4-3cb57a698a1c', '5c09954a-7742-46ec-ac46-1b20364a7798', '6409afb8-4b7c-45a5-8aa3-7f919bc33192', '73a0c278-4679-4779-b560-34eac7fb80d6', '767f5023-d716-48e0-9086-a27429ac7bb9', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '83d1485e-cb32-4b2f-91ce-319de034ad30', '8e38e195-a918-40ea-b386-06fb52c26ed6', '8f8a9d2f-fa67-4fdc-97b1-1dfd933c67ed', '9278d78b-c344-448c-b30e-0e5681accfc0', '96f8b714-02a6-4b8a-8743-961d047342c2', '9e79c45c-c6f8-43a3-a0db-d6ad3952cb5b', 'a5f7da49-edae-4d3a-8b02-52c0834686ce', 'aabd3fe1-94b6-4f7d-8afe-57f5ff1daec0', 'ac9152f9-04ca-4bd6-bbf3-d10d271ab2fd', 'bb2db3d6-fb4c-4f2b-90c8-8b0c6411acaa', 'bd0e7e91-9232-41df-ab9e-810f1b1ce9c0', 'c2efc441-b7da-409b-a724-99391f4611c4', 'c349411e-b528-42ba-b046-b2598b22fff7', 'ce92dc35-3bf0-49ea-88dc-60fd6abf3919', 'dbad7e6e-816a-438d-913e-0c99d0eef29f', 'e416c07a-79c4-4462-b5e9-c52c42035a15', 'e5b7d594-f8e7-42b8-b960-1d0f60910581', 'ec8e443b-d968-4243-a2b0-836cf0898829', 'f5d34834-4a68-4585-a953-6d706c96d5bc']",Variational Bayesian Approach to Multiframe Image Restoration,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
523,"The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system makes efficient use of spectrum and increases the transmission throughput in wireless communications. The sphere decoding (SD) is an efficient algorithm that enables the maximum-likelihood (ML) detection for the MIMO system. However, the SD algorithm has variable complexity, and its complexity increases rapidly with decreasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a novel ML detection algorithm for the MIMO system based on differential metrics. We define the differential metrics and derive the associated recursive calculation. We then give the indicative functions, which can be used to possibly find some ML-detected bits of the initial sequence. The indicative functions are further applied to implement an efficient tree search for ML detection. The proposed algorithm does not need QR decomposition and matrix inversion. The tree search process needs only the additive operation, while the number of multiplications before the tree search is constant. Our algorithm can achieve the exact ML detection as the SD algorithm. Unlike the SD algorithm, the complexity of our algorithm reduces with decreasing SNR, whereas at high SNR, the complexity is nearly constant. We also give the convergence analysis for the SD and proposed algorithms, and the simulation verifies our analysis. For the proposed algorithm, the number of necessary memory is constant during the tree search, and the implementation by parallel processing is possible. The soft output of ML-detected bits can also be generated in our algorithm.","['Ming-Xian Chang', 'Wang-Yueh Chang']",049be379-6ef0-4d43-a701-df0804295a20,0,"['08dfd689-8a5b-453b-a5f6-a6b79a8be8c6', '0ad3eb36-49e4-4347-b4eb-3209b71f086f', '0cebe0c5-740a-4b5e-8dee-bc64a60ddcad', '2e913522-0ba1-4211-8e73-b2116e095849', '32cc8f3f-f6ac-4ca8-9b16-1c8e84e8e711', '5796b0ec-74d3-45a8-b1b8-b12c331202b5', '8e8573ed-6abe-40b4-9f29-4d576a4aaad4', '91f1068b-9feb-4799-b920-67205c36999b', '98742779-78a8-4d5e-a75b-0fc3c11cd19e', '9acfcb6c-51dd-4b0c-9928-6ca69a2909bb', 'b22e4d41-d4ea-41a9-9c9e-50ddef53fc90', 'c2c1a67d-0c0e-4acb-a85a-e04b38d24be0', 'd45557e2-7c97-4326-9cb1-f70d49a7592f', 'f0ac9c88-8298-4c4d-8c1c-bb0e0e6b43f7', 'ff802536-4961-48fc-83f0-7f14c79aa4b8']",Maximum-Likelihood Detection for MIMO Systems Based on Differential Metrics,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2017
524,"Computer aided design (CAD) plays a vital role in modern VLSI design. Electronic simulation is widely used to verify the design and test the behavior of the circuit before fabrication. One of the major research areas in CAD is circuit simulation. Circuit simulation is to use mathematical models to predict the behavior of an electronic circuit. A circuit is usually represented by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs). So, the circuit simulation actually involves solving large-scale ODEs which sometimes takes several days or even weeks. Therefore, fast and accurate circuit simulation algorithms are needed to accelerate the simulation cycle. One way to speed up the simulation is to approximate the original system with an appropriately simplified system which captures the main properties of the original one. This method is called model order reduction (MOR), which reduces the complexity of the original large system and generates a reduced-order model (ROM) to represent the original one. There are many existing MOR methods, but there is no method that gives the best results for all of the systems. So, each system uses the best method according to its application. So, there is still a need for novel MOR techniques. This paper presents a novel MOR technique based on artificial intelligence.",['Khaled Salah'],da323a50-2b7f-4ca2-b6bb-6353c257c446,0,"['234c4542-071d-40ea-a2ae-10ae8f1a955c', '843cbb51-7a77-4175-91f4-4a0de4f928f3']",A novel model order reduction technique based on artificial intelligence,Microelectronics Journal,2017

This paper introduces a new over-sampling technique that focuses on noise reduction and selective sampling of the minority group which results in improvement for prediction of minority group membership.

527,"Most existing regression based classification methods for robust face recognition usually characterize the representation error using  L  1 -norm or Frobenius-norm for the pixel-level noise or nuclear norm for the image-level noise, and code the coefficients vector by  l  1 -norm or  l  2 -norm. To our best knowledge, nuclear norm can be used to describe the low-rank structural information but may lead to the suboptimal solution, while  l  1 -norm or  l  2 -norm can promote the sparsity or cooperativity but may neglect the prior information (e.g., the locality and similarity relationship) among data. To solve these drawbacks, we propose two weighted sparse coding regularized nonconvex matrix regression models including  w eighted  s parse coding regularized matrix   γ  -norm based  m atrix  r egression (WS γ MR) for the structural noise and  w eighted  s parse coding regularized matrix   γ  -norm plus  m inimax concave plus (MCP) function based  m atrix  r egression (WS γ M 2 R) for the mixed noise (e.g, structural noise plus sparse noise). The MCP induced nonconvex function can overcome the imbalanced penalization of different singular values and entries of the error image matrix, and the weighted sparse coding can consider the prior information by borrowing a novel distance metric. The variants of inexact augmented Lagrange multiplier (iALM) algorithm including nonconvex iALM (NCiALM) and majorization-minimization iALM (MMiALM) are developed to solve the proposed models, respectively. The matrix  γ -norm based classifier is devised for classification. Finally, experiments on four popular face image databases can validate the superiority of our methods compared with the-state-of-the-art regression methods.","['Hengmin Zhang', 'Jian Yang', 'Jianchun Xie', 'Jianjun Qian', 'Bob Zhang']",3729d1c4-489f-4bec-9cad-09094942f7b9,0,"['065405d8-c340-46c1-9c7c-6ab913437027', '0c0ddded-5f2a-490d-93af-359df2c0de43', '0ded3f45-2d56-4095-b934-f92493b8693f', '193d8972-efd4-4d65-bd89-4b6b9f35f49d', '1bfaea19-9ccb-4a78-9572-773eca9143be', '297a9ff7-8332-4d88-9e60-c9c2a8ead560', '2c391a40-26a6-4c5a-9850-9a96a34d295f', '2ed7b1a9-f707-4fdf-89cf-b6b5d06d3b87', '2fde2ada-6c6f-42b4-84c5-1587a3813a7a', '34028cb7-83c4-4742-a8a5-028d4338ba6e', '3e0568c5-f894-46eb-8d65-92432f7d57f8', '3f577c05-b3d6-47e4-85fe-876d05d785e7', '415570d4-085c-48ac-a46d-45ff905b4238', '4c9f2bac-2f23-4170-a0f1-a3001f63a7b9', '4e7b3cb5-087c-4d48-ba90-9e71dc6216d0', '5189803f-de1d-4122-90db-1e97a3b2f1d3', '58d62cb6-358e-4685-99f1-ab3b8e013495', '5c1e5f6e-4e0c-43c3-824a-88c27073dd32', '6258b77f-d346-4948-80ff-940d3c02e9a0', '633d21e8-bd44-4165-8608-161bbb37f706', '65106f7a-8bce-4521-ac08-a545f9fd59fa', '7236dbb7-f0b2-4e28-bb7c-6de187c32d64', '78455a55-4f30-41ac-8416-26524333f026', '7b11227f-6886-434b-90c3-100bc89120fa', '7cdd68ef-876b-4214-bd85-38dd01ac99c9', '814abbf2-665f-48e9-a94a-07e511b4f2aa', '825a8ccc-cca9-4610-8aa3-2a1518593b7a', '9b60c302-7877-4c42-9fab-6cdf85b26868', 'a5223cfb-3f6a-4cd0-9fd5-cfb9ff50c3eb', 'a81d35e6-d5cd-4eef-9144-b0755ef268d1', 'a94f889d-abce-46b7-9d65-d877585da0b6', 'b0a8f3fe-ae65-4aad-8e51-f17d789ce39d', 'b18bea07-2f0d-4e7f-bdea-c6dace98730d', 'b9da5e95-3afd-4824-a4e3-833713af943f', 'c08ef9f0-7bef-48f4-92ac-b66cd0389604', 'c3aa9f75-786e-413d-945f-31a4b4f0ed8a', 'd929d5d6-adbb-4b7d-a8ad-5a2aca6d7ee2', 'e537d143-155e-4ca0-8ae8-66b777a77fea', 'e8732459-c027-4247-a0d4-3ac7641b4ab1', 'ec41b998-c0c4-45cb-9062-5c84e06c37ca', 'ef610f77-1497-4590-a6fd-9c5000586394']",Weighted sparse coding regularized nonconvex matrix regression for robust face recognition,Information Sciences,2017

By integrating the nonlinear features into the locally weighted regression framework, LW-KPLS not only can cope with the time-varying characteristics but also is more suitable for highly nonlinear processes. The proposed method was validated through a numerical example, a penicillin fermentation process, and a real industrial cleaning process for residual drug substances.

531,"Although trait anger has been shown to play an important role in cyberbullying, little is known about mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relation among young adults. Based on the integration of the general aggression model and the social-cognitive model of moral identity, the current study investigated (a) the mediating role of moral disengagement in the relation between trait anger and cyberbullying, and (b) the moderating role of moral identity in the direct and indirect relations between trait anger and cyberbullying. This model was examined with 464 Chinese young adults. Participants filled out questionnaires regarding trait anger, cyberbullying, moral disengagement, and moral identity. After gender and age were controlled, trait anger was significantly and positively associated with cyberbullying. Mediation analysis revealed that moral disengagement partially mediated the relation between trait anger and cyberbullying. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that the direct and indirect relations between trait anger and cyberbullying were moderated by moral identity. The direct and indirect effects of trait anger on cyberbullying became non-significant for high moral identity individuals. These findings may help to design effective psychological interventions aimed at improving moral identity in young adults with higher levels of cyberbullying.","['Xingchao Wang', 'Li Yang', 'Jiping Yang', 'Pengcheng Wang', 'Li Lei']",9054f1aa-1d3b-4b02-927e-1b006a8b563e,50,"['0b03991b-fffe-4cbc-9d49-af9e0519831d', '0b4d0dcf-e554-4b5c-a0e9-cbf0be6bcda1', '0cea81ca-d21a-478e-b562-443a983de65f', '22e7c5ed-a916-4984-a5c7-002e8087aaf1', '39b3ac3d-d2c0-4f57-850a-5b351caf988b', '6e47d293-9d9c-4319-80c8-29a8c338283e', '8e0daa56-7603-4234-91f6-66fcf36e30f8', '941b3fe2-5cd4-4ded-b3c7-08e44ceb1be3', 'b5514434-21e8-4ea2-9f48-baa04c32fba4', 'd1d0c71f-0450-4292-9516-934835cd4236', 'ed24a0cf-701f-4c4c-9e8f-0c3e0739ebf6']",Trait anger and cyberbullying among young adults: A moderated mediation model of moral disengagement and moral identity,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
532,"Abstract#R##N#The relationship between the normal modes of a protein and its functional conformational change has been studied for decades. However, using this relationship in a predictive context remains a challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that, starting from a given protein conformer, it is possible to generate in a single step model conformers that are less than 1 A (Cα-RMSD) from the conformer which is the known endpoint of the conformational change, particularly when the conformational change is collective in nature. Such accurate model conformers can be generated by following either the so-called robust or the 50 lowest-frequency modes obtained with various Elastic Network Models (ENMs). Interestingly, the quality of many of these models compares well with actual crystal structures, as assessed by the ROSETTA scoring function and PROCHECK. The most accurate and best quality conformers obtained in the present study were generated by using the 50 lowest-frequency modes of an all-atom ENM. However, with less than ten robust modes, which are identified without any prior knowledge of the nature of the conformational change, nearly 90% of the motion described by the 50 lowest-frequency modes of a protein can be captured. Such results strongly suggest that exploring the robust modes of ENMs may prove efficient for sampling the functionally relevant conformational repertoire of many proteins. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['Swapnil Mahajan', 'Yves-Henri Sanejouand']",1812222b-1a75-484d-a609-c9a67277eae5,0,"['105ed87e-0527-4e60-8898-81741d807487', '266a4c14-ae26-4308-9b12-ccf518fccc77', '3454de76-6cee-43e2-9e5c-971d41c1d0b9', '37d0d3c3-5065-4549-91b3-f81c33fcc431', '616f9770-3bd9-4e44-866d-0757efd867a0', '983e98ec-b73a-42dc-bdef-f0ed2aa19641', 'c3fde2e4-18c9-4b10-a7ba-8b16906578d3', 'c6f08b7b-4829-4d9c-9546-f219611c615e', 'eb9ec0b8-726b-4931-82f3-cc178dd7b3f4', 'fd748bc1-bedb-46c1-aeb8-82c3fc7f677e']",Jumping between protein conformers using normal modes,Journal of Computational Chemistry,2017

In this study, an online formative peer-tutoring approach was proposed to cope with this problem, and an online learning system was developed accordingly. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted to explore its effects on students’ learning behaviors as well as their learning performance and perceptions of the mathematics course. The experimental results showed that both the formative and conventional peer-tutoring approaches significantly improved the students’ learning achievement as well as reduced their cognitive load in comparison with conventional online collaborative learning approaches.

535,"We propose high-order finite-volume schemes for numerically solving the steady-state advection-diffusion equation with nonlinear Robin boundary conditions. Although the original motivation comes from a mathematical model of blood clotting, the nonlinear boundary conditions may also apply to other scientific problems. The main contribution of this work is a generic algorithm for generating third-order, fourth-order, and even higher-order explicit ghost-filling formulas to enforce nonlinear Robin boundary conditions in multiple dimensions. Under the framework of finite volume methods, this appears to be the first algorithm of its kind. Numerical experiments on boundary value problems show that the proposed fourth-order formula can be much more accurate and efficient than a simple second-order formula. Furthermore, the proposed ghost-filling formulas may also be useful for solving other partial differential equations.","['Zhi Lin', 'Qinghai Zhang']",4e674658-bf76-4299-aaa7-6acf07b4ef81,0,"['133ceb25-657d-43d6-8eaa-2d8263d60163', 'f1018645-9bc1-470b-917a-ee14d0f71e2c', 'fbbdcf0b-3865-4221-a650-5e9245ef799a']",High-order finite-volume solutions of the steady-state advection-diffusion equation with nonlinear Robin boundary conditions,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
536,"This paper studies one interesting problem: how does the deep neural network (DNN) architecture affect the image quality assessment (IQA) performance? In order to find the answer, we propose a novel full-reference IQA framework, codenamed deep similarity (DeepSim). In DeepSim, we first measure the local similarities between the features (produced by a DNN model) of the test image and those of the reference image; Afterwards, the local quality indices are gradually pooled together to estimate the overall quality score. In addition, various factors that may affect the IQA performance are investigated. Thorough experiments conducted on standard databases show that: (1) DeepSim can accurately predict human perceived image quality and outperforms previous state-of-the-art; (2) mid-level representations are most effective for quality prediction; and (3) preprocessing, the restricted linear units and max-pooling operations are beneficial for the IQA performance.","['Fei Gao', 'Yi Wang', 'Panpeng Li', 'Min Tan', 'Jun Yu', 'Yani Zhu']",90f8232a-2553-4880-a2d6-1e13c4863707,0,"['00c864fe-60bc-437a-9f62-9c666cb468e0', '051956bb-f64b-4fdb-87f8-3e2868b8b5d8', '0a7a3fcc-af66-49cd-9ea8-71bb17c16830', '108636db-2116-426d-a6a5-e5ebc2c8f781', '153c5014-dc7a-44a8-a93f-5cd27f1193df', '175f5bf6-44fb-4568-87d0-5c50175ba5db', '1c74fc62-ea6f-4254-ba56-dc4fe99871f0', '1ec0138d-9301-4556-bbae-c07811f27652', '1ef33c82-e255-41d1-a1b1-658427c26b1e', '2a8d0ae2-207e-4b5e-bd2f-623c9ec2bd8a', '2aca8900-e4b0-448a-b7a9-864f9829c2ba', '35f72e87-d039-4589-8ff3-bbea3068748a', '5deb58b2-5101-4be6-b9d6-4564fcf89eab', '643413b0-139d-4426-84e4-0ff31e6821fa', '6498cd1e-e895-48a1-a974-f1aa37368af7', '71930db8-2d0d-4c25-ab44-07720b8ae4aa', '749f45fb-00c2-442a-ae3b-27fd0a9d9f40', '76ca2dfd-b703-4ec0-9775-08b6f1ed681c', '7db03331-907d-4ff2-b56b-eeb14cebf4d6', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '8dd55729-74fd-46bb-829b-555a0b4da55f', '9ad5a482-0613-4f30-b051-feba003ade93', 'a3218d27-3254-4f93-bd89-59b15468b1a7', 'a45d70ae-20a0-4288-be51-dd4113c48298', 'aa7f1841-0276-4b0b-9c0b-95925def4ac9', 'aac13509-d31a-4f1b-9029-0461c543db35', 'ac17a315-7138-4a28-8bfe-32d6e5533918', 'afd0d876-2544-4f9f-8173-5decad94eeac', 'b60f97dd-5975-41e6-8240-fd166f6a1b85', 'b9a63006-4f73-4e8e-b7cc-6e3c6335c8e2', 'bd9b706f-30dd-4ad1-a1db-09af56e13faf', 'dd4eb389-91ba-498c-b37e-ff757fd1a30f', 'dfeda0cc-9d79-428a-a5ac-542999cd296c', 'edfa2a69-073d-43dc-b0a4-d2eae46fa514', 'f1b81247-6ea9-424f-b3e1-4e300f8008e4', 'f311f487-6002-43cc-9507-b9bb50f6ebd4', 'f9c75b53-c7d7-409e-ab7c-d1e9d2b51d84', 'fb7cfdd4-5bb6-4159-858e-909f3cba8087', 'fcd32ec7-8a0f-41bc-bcc2-417edc8cbc96']",DeepSim: Deep similarity for image quality assessment,Neurocomputing,2017

538,"Electric-field energy harvesting (EFEH) can be considered as an emerging and promising alternative for self-sustainable next-generation WSNs. Unlike conventional harvesting methods that rely on ambient variables, EFEH provides more reliable and durable operation as it is operable with any voltage-applied conductive material. Therefore, it is better suited for advanced throughput and applications requiring a certain QoS. In this article, we introduce this newly emerging WSN paradigm, and focus on enabling EFEH technology for smart grid architectures, such as home, building, and near area networks, where the field intensity is relatively low. To this end, a practical methodology and a general use implementation framework have been developed for low-voltage applications by regarding compelling design issues and challenging source scarcity. The proposed double-layer harvester model is experimentally evaluated. Its performance in terms of implementation flexibility, sensor lifetime, and communication throughput is investigated.

539,"Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is one of the world’s deadliest and neglected infectious diseases, according to World Health Organization. This disease is one of major human and veterinary medical significance. The sandfly and the reservoir in urban areas remain among the major challenges for the control activities. In this paper, we evaluated five control strategies (positive dog elimination, insecticide impregnated dog collar, dog vaccination, dog treatment, and sandfly population control), considering disease control results and cost-effectiveness. We elaborated a mathematical model based on a set of differential equations in which three populations were represented (human, dog, and sandfly). Humans and dogs were divided into susceptible, latent, clinically ill, and recovery categories. Sandflies were divided into noninfected, infected, and infective. As the main conclusions, the insecticide impregnated dog collar was the strategy that presented the best combination between disease control and cost-effectiveness. But, depending on the population target, the control results and cost-effectiveness of each strategy may differ. More and detailed studies are needed, specially one which optimizes the control considering more than one strategy in activity.","['Helio Junji Shimozako', 'Jianhong Wu', 'Eduardo Massad']",f356e7de-f1dd-4f31-a324-3461fea3e5ac,0,[],The Preventive Control of Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis: Efficacy and Economic Evaluation,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2017
540,"Accurate and efficient thermal analysis for a VLSI chip is crucial, both for sign-off reliability verification and for design-time circuit optimization. To determine an accurate temperature profile, it is important to simulate a die together with its thermal mounts: this requires solving Poisson's equation on a nonrectangular 3D domain. This article presents a class of eigendecomposition-based Fast Poisson Solvers (FPS) for chip-level thermal analysis. We start with a solver that solves a rectangular 3D domain with mixed boundary conditions in O( N ṡ log N ) time, where  N  is the dimension of the finite difference matrix. Then we reveal, for the first time in the literature, a strong relation between fast Poisson solvers and Green-function-based methods. Finally, we propose an FPS method that leverages the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to solve nonrectangular 3D domains efficiently. We demonstrate this approach on thermal analysis of an industrial microprocessor, showing accurate results verified by a commercial tool, and that it solves a system of dimension 4.54e6 in only 13 conjugate gradient iterations, with a runtime of 65 seconds, a 15X speedup over the popular ICCG solver.","['Haifeng Qian', 'Sachin S.

541,"Humanoid robots are expected to be integrated into daily life. This requires the robots to perform human-like actions that are easily understandable by humans. Learning by imitation is an effective framework that enables the robots to generate the same motions that humans do. However, it is generally not useful for the robots to generate motions that are precisely the same as learned motions because the environment is likely to be different from the environment where the motions were learned. The humanoid robot should synthesize motions that are adaptive to the current environment by modifying learned motions. Previous research encoded captured human whole-body motions into hidden Markov models, which are hereafter referred to as motion primitives, and generated human-like motions based on the acquired motion primitives. The contact between the body and the environment also needs to be controlled, so that the humanoid robot’s whole-body motion can be realized in its current environment. This paper proposes a novel approach to synthesizing kinematic data using the motion primitive and controlling the torques of all the joints in the humanoid robot to achieve the desired whole-body motions and contact forces. The experiments demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach to synthesizing and controlling whole-body motions by humanoid robots.","['Wataru Takano', 'Yoshihiko Nakamura']",fb128901-b61e-4ef2-906b-07ddb95a0645,0,"['0a080bd1-3109-436f-93de-f29796f62cfe', '24d3ff75-4817-4d57-b3f4-90c9a815c34e', '29dc0718-4c0a-451e-9257-39d90e9a01d7', '4a11d0fd-d5e0-4c2e-8302-0ec82e11a3f1', '5003d21d-8fae-4c9d-b742-99de158d988f', '522321c2-7c42-4a7d-9ba9-947988e424f8', '5e564353-6b49-4846-b65e-06b0b7f62a2b', '64dd7d1b-14fb-41a8-a451-4b10aa7102d2', '8582becf-e3b6-4266-b7dc-d32bbb584f8e', '8bd3e4ff-ba31-4971-a379-b72182f52140', '8f5a9faf-98cb-47f6-a0d0-5aa7628332d4', '9a63a36d-8413-4277-a27b-e38da269980e', 'a7a8373e-f99e-42f9-b5d1-718733650250', 'baba0686-e048-414a-9044-7833332935e7', 'be144dc2-1277-4b7a-ad88-f65e85e7b73e', 'c4be2bb2-58b2-48b1-a162-f8e72587935f', 'd907533c-8868-40cc-a87b-b49d42e8e4cf', 'e94b661d-1f21-4eef-bc95-78388730026d']",Planning of goal-oriented motion from stochastic motion primitives and optimal controlling of joint torques in whole-body,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2017
542,"In recent years forward osmosis (FO) process has attracted considerable attention in the field of water treatment and desalination. However, the lack of sufficient information on all possible parameters, affecting the process performance, is a major obstacle that avoids improving the function of this method. In this study, an algorithm based upon a reliable model was developed for osmosis through asymmetric membrane oriented in FO mode to be applied in agent-based model. This model was built in the NetLogo platform, which is a programmable modeling environment for simulating natural phenomena. The feasibility of this modeling was proven by comparing the simulation results and empirical data obtained from literature. The influence of net bulk osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution (DS) and the feed solution (FS) on average water flux was studied for various draw solutes. Furthermore, the effects of process parameters, including temperature, length of module, FS cross-flow velocity, pure water permeability coefficient, and structural parameter of membrane on average water flux were investigated. As a result, it could be concluded that Netlogo agent-based model had the quite well potential to simulate the FO process.","['Mostafa Taherian', 'Seyed Mahmoud Mousavi']",a100fcd4-1950-4fc6-b74d-0a08ebe964f3,0,"['20f0fea8-e692-458b-a6d8-9273bf593f01', '37cd7747-81e4-4c29-9f65-e153b23e9ae9', '3a05b21f-af21-43db-a11c-6059363d6f6b', '73139d1a-52a4-47df-af08-a6a26a44eff0', 'a19dafb8-db52-4142-8ec6-726ad9816b68']",Modeling and simulation of forward osmosis process using agent-based model system,Computers & Chemical Engineering,2017
543,"This paper presents a formal framework of self-adaptation for multiparty sessions. The adaptation function contains the dynamic evolution policy, by prescribing how the session needs to reconfigure itself, based on critical changes in global data. A global type prescribes the overall communication choreography; its projections onto participants generate the monitors, which set-up the communication protocols. The key technical novelty of the calculus is the parallel operator for building global types and monitors, which allows the adaptation procedure to be rather flexible. The smart session is able to minimise its adaptation, by partially reconfiguring some of the communications and leaving all others unchanged, in case a part of the whole behaviour only needs to be modified. Furthermore, new participants can be added and/or some of the old participants can be removed. As a main result, we prove that this adaptation mechanism is safe, in order to guarantee that the communications will continue to evolve in a correct way after reconfiguration.","['Viviana Bono', 'Mario Coppo', 'Mariangiola Dezani-Ciancaglini', 'Betti Venneri']",b7eb4da3-0e95-4830-9544-8c6bc9cd55b1,0,"['0c0e4e79-6b26-4efa-9c36-4ea24a58bac1', '0de858f9-2acf-4685-902d-e6e553fddf64', '1f148a9a-8017-4a91-ba4b-8fe55c5956bd', '3687b3a0-cd45-423f-8bbc-ed84196d3028', '48a9f9fe-34dc-4b6d-ba41-b7a1675223ac', '4b8266b1-8f56-4856-8edb-4dfa4a1f8913', '808a2361-eb91-4b98-8a78-66c225fd1992', '82a5f69c-d7b0-4827-a1c2-f9c199a2f484', '91768280-28c1-4afd-bba6-c69bdd9d82d5', '947b7da7-23da-4fd2-821a-e2de424cb559', '9a4181a5-70d2-48b7-945d-8d72d9c74874', 'a0dba604-f5f6-4779-88c0-79234d312518', 'b8afbe2f-8197-4997-a965-f8520cc5a94f', 'd4090c73-2732-46fe-a478-02ac1878c1ac', 'd63c5cd7-e313-4a93-9ff8-eb4492f84eee', 'd79b027a-a365-4831-995e-b6b9bc87165f', 'd8ee4d5c-8742-4507-9aec-0f6ecb65427f', 'e62506ec-a92a-4119-9172-90e1a594047e', 'f328abf9-35f9-4284-8ad7-e40044d88590']",Data-driven adaptation for smart sessions,The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming,2017

545,"The THTMTP (two-level hierarchical time minimization transportation problem) is an important problem arising in industries. In literature, there are only two approaches with shortcomings to solve the problem. In this paper, the THTMTP is formulated as a mathematical model applicable to the case in which the total available supply at the sources is no less than the total demand at the destinations. A feasible flow-based iterative algorithm named THTMTP-A is proposed to solve the THTMTP by constructing network with lower and upper arc capacities. It is proved that the THTMTP-A algorithm can find the optimal solution to the THTMTP in a polynomial time. The proposed THTMTP-A algorithm has good performance in terms of computer implementation, computational time and required memory for computation, and hence overcomes successfully the shortcomings of the two existing approaches.

547,"Gamification is a relatively new trend that focuses on applying game mechanics to non-game contexts in order to engage audiences and to inject a little fun into mundane activities besides generating motivational and cognitive benefits. While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics.","['Lamyae Sardi', 'Ali Idri', 'José Luis Fernández-Alemán']",e82630f7-58ae-4b9c-912c-6c9b04526954,0,"['05da385f-21df-4509-ae3a-ff0681744f94', '095c41ff-edb9-4787-a2dc-2501729aa781', '0c8140af-6dcd-4ffb-8131-bb08c9b3be1b', '0dce76ba-63d2-4635-a81a-aefa3b636504', '110a22e0-fb5d-40ba-869e-06d20cfcee4a', '13a0583c-881f-414a-8aae-ea31293bfbe5', '17a30a43-641a-4878-96c3-5d2c5a21a8f0', '1df51ad5-2602-48ab-a5fe-cf4707869ccd', '25a96e1e-0ec7-4be6-8d9e-4c4c8a7fdc53', '25dcfc82-fc4e-4e44-b3dd-6e31e9033550', '27f4a44c-de5e-4f61-8c1d-8b5e9eac22de', '2d02ced0-f600-4ae4-8db3-66001ce5e20b', '2dba0f59-ec3f-42e3-9913-db2f29c3e198', '32d7e56d-68ea-4baf-b4ff-be3f4379cd21', '35ae44c7-73aa-476c-8dc2-33367b430f4a', '3722061b-ce12-4a79-a9b6-8fb373b73137', '44b0c0ea-5485-44c1-b0df-95969979538c', '472525b5-7fc7-4b97-93d9-f8c4170d351f', '475a67f0-d511-4fd3-81a5-62aa8c9387d4', '4a1342fc-370e-4755-84ab-bcdd881c1d19', '4b0471a4-c470-4088-a47c-a4c71e4f7791', '4c28278f-0212-4a69-a3a9-1214dad3498f', '5eefb7a2-04e9-4679-9012-ab1ba33a1c54', '62630419-67cf-46f9-9ae5-ffd9ad0e7848', '674e3f08-050f-493f-b427-f9e5f22c9992', '69cc39a6-93cb-4eb7-8786-93ed1bf7c619', '6cf03553-b16f-468a-9cc3-f8ce0127bad0', '6ddb170f-63ab-485e-916c-792133eb707b', '6e867107-94da-4cbe-997c-8b516845f012', '6f5ea6c4-d4ad-4529-9b9c-c91fc597e62f', '74b7e539-e53c-49ef-b6e8-677a1c31c66f', '76e308d4-0b37-43d7-b3b1-d345f8075f73', '78962a0f-1371-4ddf-a30f-e0ee0ff8b182', '85bf04b6-be9a-4d70-a449-990ee07afeae', '93371dd0-3d5a-459b-8735-e3e11a70b5fe', '97d6aa0b-09b4-4db7-a49e-0c8ff038485a', 'ae3b5715-f13a-4f49-ab8a-b8ba56588c9e', 'afe63854-5f4d-41dc-b5c3-4d36d03a7462', 'b8391765-3c82-4d6a-b60d-288aebd3f73c', 'ba5bd9a9-9207-419f-83d8-2718dc427aa9', 'c4ed3f81-7b15-41db-9d86-d14648f77164', 'c68ecebb-a990-49a5-94c2-ba146d773972', 'c94dc425-dc10-4c31-9857-0d70d5072c9e', 'd739f6f1-1a88-4004-9975-bfce68848da3', 'da010e7c-4ac2-4cbb-9582-d2635cbdde6b', 'da62d11d-e970-4030-8aae-7c5dbffcd5d4', 'de69edf8-64f5-46ee-a887-495987b690d1', 'dfae9c27-9235-4044-b41e-462de7085423', 'e23f6594-bf89-479c-86fc-2bfb2ed49821', 'e31480db-138c-46b4-b682-2000703a773d', 'ea26b254-d3a6-4084-b04c-014730a040fd', 'ec4cf2ab-b08a-41dd-a9ba-fed3bd95ce22', 'f60a1c25-fa41-47aa-b8f3-06869b4a06c7', 'f993e19f-8a55-441d-855c-8475100fc53e', 'fd6edb65-2492-43c7-b4d9-11976455afd3']",A Systematic Review of Gamification in e-Health,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,2017
548,"This paper examines the relationship between Twitter sentiment on the announcement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) succession and stock returns over the period 2010–2015. The study comprises data from 100 listed companies from the UK and the USA. A code was written to collect data from Twitter using the platform Python. We provide novel evidence on how Twitter reactions measured by the Twitter Sentiment Score (TSS) of CEO succession announcements are used to forecast stock returns, finding that Twitter sentiment has a negative contemporaneous relationship with stock returns and CEO succession announcements. Furthermore, we explore the influence of CEO demographic characteristics (e.g. age, tenure, education, gender and professional experience) on stock returns. We find a positive and highly significant relationship between CEO age at announcement and stock returns.","['Darren Leitch', 'Mohamed Sherif']",1a5d62db-cb5e-47b5-912f-6dfc81d05c25,0,"['1d342873-ae9d-4902-adb6-638d8419453a', '2d86abaa-a6ad-47f2-995c-279a82971c59', '680fc0b5-47b5-4312-b5b9-df3a3d285d84', '7aab3044-0eaa-426f-8056-26243132bc83', '84c3d580-2ecf-4151-8ddf-de59017b4281', 'cb69b6cf-7347-45fe-989d-3dd3f4d7bbfe', 'fd3961fe-42e4-4c92-88fe-26f91ed463a3']","Twitter mood, CEO succession announcements and stock returns",Journal of Computational Science,2017
549,"Falls are common among older people, especially in hospitals and nursing homes. The combination of pervasive sensing and statistical learning methods is creating new possibilities for automatic monitoring of activities of hospitalized older people to provide targeted and timely supervision by clinical staff to reduce falls. In this paper we introduce a hierarchical conditional random fields model to predict alarming states (being out of the bed or chair) from a passive wearable embodiment of a sensor worn over garment to provide an intervention mechanism to reduce falls. Our approach predicts alarm states in real time and avoids the use of empirically determined heuristics methods alone or in combination with machine learning based models, or multiple cascaded classifiers for generating alarms from activity prediction streams. Instead, the proposed hierarchical approach predicts alarms based on learned relationships between alarms, sensor information and predicted low-level activities. We evaluate the performance of the approach with 14 healthy older people and 26 hospitalized older patients and demonstrate similar or better performance than machine learning based approaches combined with heuristics based methods.","['Roberto Luis Shinmoto Torres', 'Qinfeng Shi', 'Anton van den Hengel', 'Damith Chinthana Ranasinghe']",f7d13e83-98e1-4426-8995-bd5d12b089f2,0,"['13d83701-8e72-482a-882e-fc1450146d6e', '1f8f1317-5769-48ff-820e-4dfe6bed75c6', '24ef3a29-4dae-4009-b314-53a1836b8b0c', '28b6d937-2070-4995-9644-b0ccb071ebd3', '28d589de-5325-4fc4-bbe8-3659d8d28c87', '3d3c7a69-3143-4d29-ba63-833fd828fdc8', '405609a0-e5c8-48d8-bdc5-e5e115faef2b', '626a9e0a-d1e7-4b08-a9c2-4496aca827cd', '62b8b4de-5336-481f-bcc8-26998d83d813', '6a74f8db-0d42-46aa-92ec-c1f61ea6428c', '6ff179ae-4bf9-477f-bb10-382fb1d38a9c', '77d52890-ec09-4b9f-812c-2d463f32dbb8', '8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498', '8b29989e-bacb-438b-882d-d633b96bcb88', 'a5ae3974-2dc3-474b-963e-ac260f93b51f', 'a6571485-2307-486a-9a9c-6c08a30ca73f', 'a6b2b5df-d99e-4b36-9ab2-3132d13c4bae', 'a7b12c17-82f7-4af9-a5ed-6b9cdf0797b3', 'a9b2dbbf-540a-403a-847b-907535049e46', 'b0ebe10d-2d80-49ce-b6a8-5a7501ea78bb', 'd035fba1-511a-4e84-a235-bc64aa8bb454', 'd3c37544-b59e-4f46-9f6b-a0be4ffd1ab1', 'db1cc853-9eb5-4b6e-a90a-2fa44fb7dd7b', 'e61de4bd-76e3-4917-8e0d-1bd2a7da9ea9']",A hierarchical model for recognizing alarming states in a batteryless sensor alarm intervention for preventing falls in older people,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,2017

When the population was stratified by five year age groups per Mathiowetz Rating Scale and compared to Mathiowetz normal values, 23 out of 120 possible comparisons (19%) had associated p-values <0.10, suggesting moderate evidence of differences between study and reference values. In simulated 10-year age groups, 23 out of 60 possible comparisons (38%) had relatively large differences between our measurements and Mathiowetz [20/23 (87%) were greater than 10% and 8 (35%) were greater that 15%]. Negative differences (N=19) were more frequent than positive differences (N=4), which indicates our patient population as a whole has decreased HGS compared to previous populations though we note this difference in HGS measurements is less in patients over 45 years of age.#R##N#Conclusions:#R##N#Normative hand strength values need to be further assessed in a larger study to update normative standards for use in clinical practice.#R##N#Level of Evidence:#R##N#2c.","['Camilla C.

551,"We consider the problem of recovering a complete (i.e., square and invertible) matrix    $ A_{0},$   , from    $ Y \in \mathbb R ^{n \times p},$    with    $ Y = A_{0}, X_{0},$   , provided    $ X_{0},$    is sufficiently sparse. This recovery problem is central to theoretical understanding of dictionary learning, which seeks a sparse representation for a collection of input signals and finds numerous applications in modern signal processing and machine learning. We give the first efficient algorithm that provably recovers    $ A_{0},$    when    $ X_{0},$    has    $O \left ({ n },\right )$    nonzeros per column, under suitable probability model for    $ X_{0},$   . In contrast, prior results based on efficient algorithms either only guarantee recovery when    $ X_{0},$    has    $O(\sqrt {n},)$    zeros per column, or require multiple rounds of semidefinite programming relaxation to work when    $ X_{0},$    has    $O(n)$    nonzeros per column. Our algorithmic pipeline centers around solving a certain nonconvex optimization problem with a spherical constraint. In this paper, we provide a geometric characterization of the objective landscape. In particular, we show that the problem is highly structured with high probability: 1) there are no “spurious” local minimizers and 2) around all saddle points the objective has a negative directional curvature. This distinctive structure makes the problem amenable to efficient optimization algorithms. In a companion paper, we design a second-order trust-region algorithm over the sphere that provably converges to a local minimizer from arbitrary initializations, despite the presence of saddle points.","['Ju Sun', 'Qing Qu', 'John Wright']",d08c5a36-3738-490f-af87-c218a2fcf3d9,50,"['025b33b4-cb36-4809-9626-d8eeaf166a1e', '0349d52d-d648-474a-bed1-4cc507717d1f', '036a19f8-fdca-4e84-a237-e54f2108dcb4', '050ce22f-3d91-43de-9ab5-de34bd2cfd54', '06bc717f-2740-40aa-9804-d4035c4cd103', '08298707-334e-464c-b973-3ad5eac8d616', '0bd14d1a-8df8-4944-b9d0-98cd6e1d57c2', '0c151818-b6c3-4e8a-89a8-9a84a22c7249', '0ddbfee1-8cc2-49f6-be79-59276f496884', '0faabee3-4257-45d5-abb8-760f30f9819e', '1101e2fd-eb03-473a-8dc2-22b71864d382', '18d5c966-e1bd-403c-9003-c44b33397049', '1aeeec6b-126d-4820-9b1e-c356977f1733', '1b890d18-54e1-4ab6-bff5-5f80516f07f2', '20db0131-bae9-4d09-aea2-6581fad03990', '20f0de65-79cc-4bd7-8f06-1e6dbb3d989b', '22c28d85-f8dd-4c2f-b4c6-c9f87fcfcda9', '22deba0d-c47c-4b51-9a6d-cbb180d31183', '232fe828-c30f-474d-8d48-5dc1915fe7b3', '23dc6696-7644-4736-8eb9-ff22f210aa3e', '25a1e2ee-2666-477f-b057-3d4d33a84c8f', '267cc989-64be-4554-85b1-5ed025354f97', '27748692-99e2-4d8a-b258-d64b2bba0cb3', '29f694c3-a1e9-4dbd-bbfb-4006d3d06ea7', '30175521-52d2-4f10-88af-e23b8e01376f', '3199ba82-89ab-4e65-b8d5-1143375e1ce2', '324e2bd8-2d8a-476f-88d2-d470c44f5fe8', '3571d0c0-51b8-41c7-980e-4131fae8cadb', '36536a57-465e-4956-a518-2d1b81ac7670', '3c85f893-b643-4b4c-9697-85497f18041a', '3cf2de01-0632-4d6c-b32b-8dd180cd032b', '3e297df0-7b4f-422e-9b9a-eedc14e7e5f8', '42a7fb54-258e-4a69-a8db-c212d20fe826', '430eddb4-c31d-493e-baa4-4f83a2ba4b96', '4661fd29-fa1d-4943-bffe-512fbe329314', '4f68e9bc-2410-41b7-9d3e-9d787918ab69', '50c0b3f4-451b-47db-8a1d-4dab78637588', '532f9d21-72d9-4add-b019-01059a688c53', '57ae58df-ab77-436c-8989-f99599399d93', '5da29eee-8cfd-4916-8b9e-01f58f218f9e', '62cdb2b7-715a-4cf7-af4d-4ff309234cf2', '67084502-339f-4ffd-a86e-ecfcb0b82bf1', '6a7f9429-ed16-425d-9822-5b02837f5db8', '6c0b1815-de02-4033-9abd-50862270f409', '70207eac-114d-4b75-834a-febedf8df979', '7582a7c9-0225-482a-b15d-d1b5b66ce01f', '75c13681-7ffb-4f92-b45f-805c18aff4e5', '76434aee-91a7-43fe-ade5-0fc42b04098b', '7cfb57dc-30a2-46f3-baab-7748e7b62a1c', '823f7790-a656-471e-91b0-94ab27c8b0ba', '89f81f83-abf8-40f5-b6e5-a98b9801b6a7', '8d3eac83-7d9b-48fc-b67f-949729c29d72', '90c5cd37-56bf-4344-9986-650962eeb7cc', '91690223-1585-4fa7-b726-f74204b05000', '93a0987b-b46f-4654-b2f8-77711dccb5f3', '970690e8-67bb-425a-b33e-57228c113452', '971d555b-a8fc-4542-ba13-4bd9d3490a6c', '984e6f85-be9b-4965-b8c0-ae5887007504', '9e0df4b8-bdd2-4e42-8681-75cdf9d9eaa7', '9ef6dfb8-c568-401c-ac00-be7c6f3791ee', 'a1191398-de09-4bb6-a566-3f3bb193f72d', 'a1494dfe-ca52-4757-9a07-d0a0df32490e', 'a1972b53-f1bd-41a9-8826-5e9c11e16bb0', 'a4019710-0953-42a8-af18-703ce48a8423', 'a552c122-b29a-44f8-b39d-e57daf13307f', 'a599870e-e406-4a76-a637-39c5d67c00da', 'a81d35e6-d5cd-4eef-9144-b0755ef268d1', 'aa0f6312-0a9a-40ba-9484-00938d8660b4', 'abebb996-20ec-4aed-a01f-49207e12968c', 'ad3b5a93-46ee-4c04-8927-00a3563203f0', 'ae541631-ead1-4b6f-bffa-1742c8d98adb', 'af302d13-68dd-4568-bbe4-00d20e7069df', 'bb388b1c-5036-48c7-b96b-a11b13769154', 'bc6a0feb-78e4-4493-8a6a-aa56bd6dea9d', 'be093453-990d-4bb3-87a1-45b50156139c', 'c22eeb41-955c-4dec-882f-72f381fa3baf', 'c540a7ab-d0aa-4cf5-a8a5-56b0708fad6f', 'ca59562e-1d96-47af-8d60-2df441727e3f', 'd19091e3-592f-4750-bcf8-eac30622cd0e', 'd2c2a81b-7033-43f6-88a7-4555863762e9', 'd59e584a-40cd-4193-a2b5-009745276c8c', 'd5d00691-070e-4a23-9bd6-063a05fffcf6', 'd6e21a83-06ca-49ab-aafd-04ef3c8ae67e', 'd800f906-4926-4358-91bf-9e4f0a4939a0', 'd91c14a7-1d4e-45ff-9a72-12ea992b0f86', 'db0244eb-d9ec-4713-a98b-fa38c1742ee9', 'db4bd1fb-1330-41b8-9de6-37fb14341355', 'dcb3aa3e-2c0b-4547-8a8c-fe69d772e281', 'deaf4240-482b-4480-90ac-0514a1aa04e1', 'df20dd57-943e-4ac6-9d4e-c5a0ced37a01', 'e113e4a8-bccb-4a77-8b17-c0e42dd41296', 'e52612c7-6e13-47c5-8933-c5df62fda719', 'e541e043-f2dc-474a-959c-f2969a1304f3', 'e55d0433-841f-48b2-bc3e-4ac9ecfabed6', 'e6948d21-658c-4765-9719-a5250a34c94b', 'eacf08f1-1e8b-44ee-90b5-234724ae8355', 'ee9078cc-6b23-4f88-a639-c255570322ac', 'ef73454a-3841-4f88-8009-61fd7b53d1c3', 'ef787782-24e6-4367-a256-f5a08c375541', 'f9433d4c-6d85-4ca8-908b-dcb424b4ff4f', 'fd2b99a8-3f22-4f38-aa1f-f83e3942d51d', 'fee36d23-5b90-4afe-8d51-3e4d2632065c']",Complete Dictionary Recovery Over the Sphere I: Overview and the Geometric Picture,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,2017
552,"This paper addresses a discontinuous multi-activity tour scheduling problem under demand uncertainty and when employees have identical skills. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic programming model, where first-stage decisions correspond to the assignment of employees to weekly tours, while second-stage decisions are related to the allocation of work activities and breaks to daily shifts. A multi-cut L-shaped method is presented as a solution approach. Computational results on real-based and randomly generated instances show that the use of the stochastic model helps to reduce understaffing and overstaffing costs, when compared with the expected-value problem solutions.","['María I.

553,"A large proportion of polar anthropogenic compounds routinely released into the environment comprises homologue series, i.e., sets of chemicals differing in a repeating chemical unit. Using analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), these compounds are readily measurable as signal sets with characteristic differences in mass and typically retention time. However, and despite such distinct characteristics, no computational approach for the direct, simultaneous and untargeted detection of all such signal sets comprising both LC and HRMS information has to date been presented. A fast two-staged approach has been developed to extract LC-HRMS signal patterns which can be indicative of homologous analytes. In a first stage, a k-d tree representation of picked LC-HRMS peaks is used to extract all feasible 3-tuples of peaks with restrictions in, e.g., mass defect differences. A second stage then recombines these 3-tuples to larger series tuples while ensuring smooth changes in their retention time characteristics. This unsupervised approach was evaluated for ten effluent samples from Swiss sewage treatment plants (STPs), in both positive and negative electrospray-ionization. Beside recovering all continuous series of previously identified homologues, substantial fractions of nontargeted peaks could subsequently be assigned into very diverse peak series, although assignments were often not unique. The latter ambiguities were resolved by a self-organizing map technique and revealed both distinctive series meshing and rivaling combinatorial solutions in the presence of isobaric or gapped series peaks. When comparing STPs, several ubiquitous yet partially low-frequent series mass differences emerged and may prioritize future identification efforts.

This nontargeted search first extracts series triplets in a nearest-neighbour walk and then recombines them to larger ones.

554,"Salient object detection, experienced several decades, has been an active and popular topic in computer vision. Although a large amount of detection algorithms have been proposed, the obtained saliency maps are still not satisfying enough. To this end, we proposed a simple and novel supervised algorithm to detect a pure background saliency map using conditional random fields (CRF) and saliency cues. Most existing CRF approaches set up the probabilistic graphical models with pixel-wise eight neighborhood grid-shaped graph, while our superpixel level graph handling can not only simplify the model but also promote the performance due to the superpixel level two-ring with pseudo-background neighborhood system. It is intuitive and easy to interpret. As a result, the saliency maps generated by the proposed model have relatively pure background regions. Extensive experimental evaluations on six benchmark datasets with pixel-wise ground truths validated the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed saliency model.","['Wenliang Qiu', 'Xinbo Gao', 'Bing Han']",b7443639-4307-4ac0-afc8-c832ef70dddb,0,"['03883071-3807-402a-be4a-fb75d206a783', '07a30fda-4669-4e3c-beb1-538706cf106d', '092c559f-25b9-4964-9052-cdeebe6f5ce1', '1049fe32-c8ba-40ca-b813-6a1a8aef1998', '143d1d53-2a44-4cbd-9fe6-a1403a1fb804', '1e35adbd-6bb9-4511-87f6-4fbe9d5dd55f', '24082e6e-1750-49a1-ada3-f0fe1d65cd4b', '26c05d3b-7e18-47d1-aa6f-95204fc6c112', '3027f131-be54-43d2-9352-c13ad3b14af8', '3ceadfd2-ccee-4b00-87ec-a2f10f675985', '3fa36c36-6bb4-4214-a499-849becd950b3', '4bbf4b9a-2742-470e-838c-83ae7d3112a0', '4c25c8bf-8625-416c-9cf1-d8c076f997a3', '4f363ea7-961a-4d6b-9512-3644b2700804', '57ce64c5-36ba-4def-a8f6-811c27e7e430', '58632519-4306-4b71-9343-d392554f6713', '61185f17-282b-4432-8d6e-18fc4d5aa3bc', '6742861c-56e7-4189-ae12-477890ad0e18', '6d121e97-e351-4cf9-8c44-d7ab3ce9d9fe', '6d4bd281-c999-4ab8-acbc-d64d15d7fe5b', '73747647-8971-4119-a422-320c16c4c756', '74844e10-51df-4dd8-a229-ce036015cb23', '78ec950f-201a-494a-8cf8-df44a13d4b36', '84ebed01-2da5-43be-8185-d69be6d503fa', '86b626a6-f948-45ea-8e92-8102e0dc5ef8', '88a1d409-c3f4-4252-b831-56518e6a179a', '92f24f9d-b487-452b-9d0f-ec626d42096a', 'a325dbe0-ff47-445d-a21d-8dcedbc33919', 'a612bc01-22a0-46ad-9f59-c98a9704ac19', 'a79af813-aaf3-4b00-a63b-2ddfadb81c41', 'a895cf1c-9be1-42bf-9c06-76ed6536b356', 'a97b98f9-ee24-4421-80a5-39cc1b9d1d3e', 'aacc9251-8e66-44e8-802a-8fb655225d18', 'ab3afb93-8ca0-4556-ae60-11199dc263c2', 'bc5877af-2565-400b-9a99-4737c705e88a', 'd62e4202-a924-4496-a638-a3850b9618ca', 'd8e5753c-60d0-45be-b681-afdb8140be0a', 'dae5f09a-d8d4-41aa-9c20-f5b775011972', 'db41affb-36f1-4729-97fb-82c9e43c0985', 'de2bd6a7-7f4f-4059-9835-65c932bebabe', 'deb5bb26-91ca-495b-9a8f-5ebb8633c4e8', 'e21099c3-0707-46f1-8819-74b8abac23a9', 'e491c2e8-8b5c-4722-ad33-98b029afb369', 'ea0beebf-a462-47e0-b7a6-19ab435aa606', 'ed2439d5-cead-4dd3-a9cc-a95578e33686', 'ef17f634-aeb4-443b-9940-b1c671001783', 'fceccf1e-8a61-420a-b548-2b4a942b81bd', 'fd14fab9-2ad3-4bb8-9d1b-285c62bbeeb2']",A superpixel-based CRF saliency detection approach,Neurocomputing,2017

From the results of the examined works, we conclude that systems employing 2D views of 3D data typically surpass voxel-based (3D) deep models, which however, can perform better with more layers and severe data augmentation.

557,"Unsupervised discovery and extraction of common shapes from unlabeled images is a fundamental problem in object recognition and has broad applications in practice. However, shape discovery suffers from the lack of consistent matching methods for finding the correspondences between objects with different colors/textures among the input images. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised shape discovery method using Synchronized Spectral Network (SSN) which provides automatic part-part correspondences across images. The SSN is spectral graph-based model that encodes the pixel self-similarities of different images in spectral bases, and synchronizes the bases between images to achieve the part-part correspondences. Unlike explicit feature matching, correspondences obtained by spectral synchronization are independent of colors/textures and image modalities. An image network can then be built by spectral correspondences where the common shapes among them can be easily identified and segmented. Our results in multiple shape discovery datasets demonstrate that we outperform the state-of-the-art object/shape discovery methods, providing better segmentations for common shapes.","['Yunliang Cai', 'Andrea Lum', 'Ashley Mercado', 'Mark Landis', 'James Warrington', 'Shuo Li']",59107fae-5b86-4b0e-a9f4-795409717cda,0,"['00db6b4d-a399-4084-894c-8d2fee6e0673', '05c86322-8109-4627-bddf-8d209db4aa83', '075068a1-b8e0-4918-b7c0-bc596f3d43bc', '07c0c504-73d8-42c7-86d9-1ad761ba3a27', '0e61857a-e8a0-456e-8ad8-9a83c891db85', '1933c954-b2ed-49bd-9e17-29edb3fb9f8f', '26316adf-569e-49bc-a289-c1ba311624f6', '36b45a32-a15b-40f0-bafb-9d3de8b19e54', '37c5104a-63b7-4864-bd6c-c3f09da44f54', '3f46d193-27a9-4fdb-b6e5-10e8be6cb4de', '3fa9c193-9ae9-4dae-8b78-357316f0cc5d', '47e3a0fe-b2ad-495b-bfaa-ac0e4c723b8e', '49ecd2c5-4bef-405c-82e4-3946f3d81306', '4c182f20-c803-4608-bb77-7aa513b0c367', '4d0f4532-1352-4a1d-9dbf-e331fcbfca16', '4fb4813b-e5bc-4d6b-b546-1fd9f33033cb', '5ffadf36-4496-4be6-b8a8-828fa37f7757', '643404e1-40b9-4147-b3d2-9be8270c0087', '6a55d3e2-0b20-4b2b-8f0a-395f1b4529c4', '6ebf2c62-d52a-4645-8c8f-8cd3d7cac8e7', '75f03811-61bd-44f1-8044-71a2b2336a7f', '766d601a-5667-4159-964f-2a5df539ffec', '825905c2-d40e-4571-998f-6934de562767', '8267a730-3a8e-418d-b5ac-8effef3c97eb', '8fb9dbd7-b8fa-4c6d-a444-3aac41e2865c', 'a33f0d9b-dda4-433f-af99-344c2e1651f9', 'afe52408-b549-43bd-9d92-6631351480eb', 'b185094d-6d49-438d-88f2-39dfad6b4794', 'c1ba77c4-1a25-4fac-9be7-f3107b2a4abd', 'cdc15bd0-d35f-4bab-9e41-da5cf6f5d731', 'd5921b14-a3d0-471e-bc81-a0f01b780972', 'eadac557-e7f8-43f5-9b59-f89376a15699', 'ed8539c5-108e-4482-8697-3365bf159017', 'eec18993-7888-4fc8-a36d-6fde070c699d', 'f07b0989-31aa-4289-b204-1ddf738dcc39', 'f111ff97-89a3-4df6-8f02-962d7b4fe985']",Unsupervised shape discovery using synchronized spectral networks,Pattern Recognition,2017
558,"A credal network associates a directed acyclic graph with a collection of sets of probability measures. Usually these probability measures are specified by tables containing probability values. Here we examine the complexity of inference in credal networks when probability measures are specified through formal languages.

559,"The probabilistic stream model was introduced by Jayram et al. [2007]. It is a generalization of the data stream model that is suited to handling  probabilistic  data, where each item of the stream represents a probability distribution over a set of possible events. Therefore, a probabilistic stream determines a distribution over a potentially exponential number of classical  deterministic  streams, where each item is deterministically one of the domain values.   We present algorithms for computing commonly used aggregates on a probabilistic stream. We present the first one pass streaming algorithms for estimating the expected mean of a probabilistic stream. Next, we consider the problem of estimating frequency moments for probabilistic data. We propose a general approach to obtain unbiased estimators working over probabilistic data by utilizing unbiased estimators designed for standard streams. Applying this approach, we extend a classical data stream algorithm to obtain a one-pass algorithm for estimating  F  2 , the second frequency moment. We present the first known streaming algorithms for estimating  F  0 , the number of distinct items on probabilistic streams. Our work also gives an efficient one-pass algorithm for estimating the median, and a two-pass algorithm for estimating the range.","['T. S. Jayram', 'Andrew McGregor', 'S.

560,"Biometrics is based on the analysis of biometric features and is usually used for person recognition. In this article we analyze biometric features related to touch screen gestures. The proposed approach to person identification has a great application potential due to the popularity of mobile devices, so research in this area will be an important direction of technological development. The aims of this research are to design and build a data acquisition system to collect surveys resulting from the execution of single finger gestures on a mobile device screen and to propose data preprocessing procedure and to indicate the best classification method for person recognition based on these surveys. The experiment with fifty persons, nine gestures and ten repetitions was performed, so 4 500 surveys acquired and analyzed within the developed system. Depending on the classification method the accuracy of the task of gesture-based person recognition was in the range from 96.60% to 99.29%. All the patterns, which achieved the highest performance in terms of the typical performance measures consist of a single connected movement of a finger over the touch screen. The patterns which include multiple disconnected segments and/or taps are less successful in the task of recognizing people.","['Krzysztof Rzecki', 'Paweł Pławiak', 'Michał Niedźwiecki', 'Tomasz Sośnicki', 'Jacek Leśkow', 'Maciej Ciesielski']",d50ecc6e-91d7-4af1-9201-284adca8878a,0,"['01570ac6-ab0a-4e78-a145-d65ff4e4ec22', '0e5fecc6-90d0-432a-907e-78a87542e7be', '0f62aafc-abcc-4b92-a602-e98fe70e233d', '12d6aa75-3066-4e5f-a73d-f0d56c9d99f5', '46461afb-99b5-4ae3-8bf0-b725de7bbf45', '50dd56db-151d-4d62-8576-65f0ef6f381b', '976c4962-f8c9-40f1-8888-777f5199861d', 'afc0bbe5-b1cb-4585-a243-293eccf57729', 'b21bb361-0d7e-4c05-afcc-34f4ad19700b', 'bd936d43-9907-4eb0-b6a5-92536c0bd659', 'e2e49859-06b0-4e62-b5f2-6e13660762d7', 'f0ffa69e-b7de-42dc-8dfa-e3431a9a1e15', 'feae3307-1a13-491f-a375-310efc7a9fad']",Person Recognition based on Touch Screen Gestures using Computational Intelligence Methods,Information Sciences,2017

After exposure, participants informed themselves about the issue online. Eye tracking allows to investigate whether individuals mainly scan information, or whether they compute information on a higher level of attention (use more thorough deliberate comparison of information and really reading information).#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Findings#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Three different frames of online content were identified. Framing was found to influence the individual online searching and reading of information on a descriptive level (entering search words and viewing website content) to some degree, but not on a procedural level (such as selecting online search results).#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Research limitations/implications#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This study makes a significant contribution to the literature embedding an established theoretical process like framing effects into the internet literature. Regarding the broader theoretical context, this study shed some light on cross-media framing effects on online behavior. Applying the psychological perspective of framing theory to explain and predict online searching behavior is beneficial for specific types of online search behavior. Main limitations are the not representative student sample and the forced task that participants had to inform themselves about Alzheimer’s disease online.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Practical implications#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#The results have practical implications for the creation of TV-related websites. There can be a positive, profitable synergy of TV and online websites. The websites can complement the TV programs with the focus on information needs of the recipients depending on the TV activated audience frames.

564,"Online role-playing video games provide opportunities to connect socially and can enhance self-esteem. For some players, however, overuse fosters dependency leading to negative psychosocial and health consequences. Per the American Psychiatric Association, criteria for diagnosis of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) follow an addiction model, and include characteristics such as preoccupation, tolerance, and withdrawal. Though useful, this approach lacks a focus on underlying motivations that may partially explain vulnerability to IGD. This study explored relationships among IGD symptoms and two potential risk factors: social phobia and player-avatar identification. Participants (N = 394; 50% female) were recruited from game-related internet forums and surveyed online. We tested a model in which a positive relationship between social phobia and IGD symptoms was partially mediated by stronger avatar identification. Social phobia, avatar identification, and IGD symptoms were strongly positively related, and we found modest support for mediation as proposed. Accordingly, we suggest that fundamental needs for social connection and approval are potent motivators to play, particularly for socially phobic players uncomfortable with face-to-face contact. Vicarious interactions through a gaming avatar may fulfill these needs, reinforcing stronger self-identification with the avatar, which in turn can offer players a stronger and more positive sense of self. Such influences may work synergistically to motivate increasing intensity of and preoccupation with gameplay, contributing to IGD. These results support the use of player-avatar identification in assessing risk for IGD, developing treatment options, and reaching a better understanding of how socialization and identity can be influenced by virtual interactions and accomplishments.","['Sasha R.

565,"The traditional active contour models cannot segment the remote sensing river images accurately. To solve this problem, a novel active contour model based on modified symmetric cross entropy is proposed. In the proposed model, the external energy constraint terms are defined by the symmetric cross entropy and the region fitting centers are represented by the medians of pixel grayscale values inside the object and background regions. Moreover, the penalty energy term is incorporated into the energy functional to avoid the re-initialization. In order to improve the segmentation efficiency of the proposed model, the Chebyshev distance between the pixel grayscale values inside the region and its region fitting center is chosen as its region energy weight, which can be adaptively adjusted, instead of the constant region energy weight. The extensive experiments are performed on a large number of remote sensing river images and the results demonstrate that, compared with the CV model, the GAC model, the CEACM model, the RSF model, the LIF model, and the LGIF model, the proposed model can segment the images more accurately and rapidly, which has the clear advantages in both segmentation performance and segmentation efficiency.","['Bin Han', 'Yiquan Wu']",98676807-2b28-41db-95c7-30cdf208efdf,0,"['105d23eb-c663-4546-9629-f68c466b31cb', '1c63e1d5-b963-455b-829d-e4f3eb63a36a', '1ed66ad0-f298-4500-b534-6860cd3084d1', '24e5fc2a-36be-4dca-8c83-6a37ab3dfb83', '31b7f395-424c-4504-8979-f4416aa8119d', '328dd015-023b-4fa7-8f85-70469e5f603d', '39bd032d-6555-4ce7-8860-a11f2a66c1f5', '43622ae1-57d6-452a-8fe5-ed66bbd92396', '443fb8d3-09ba-45a2-98a6-597799c3e63c', '4f101e1e-4de6-4989-87ff-7dffafc88408', '59afdf3f-b09f-4ab6-bbfb-84032e12dd92', '79e584c0-1d1c-42bc-9b97-31bc3b04ef9e', '82eb55e6-39a8-4968-8be6-e2bfbb439a40', '927bbbd6-b2c8-4164-b975-81d195c48776', '9c9a39ad-b47c-4270-8d37-8bd33b383840', 'a18c919e-113b-439c-9ef0-535e3883dd26', 'aff569e1-a040-40ad-8505-357754826d44', 'b110e703-a3bd-4771-ad5b-30769ffdfb2b', 'b921ef6a-96bb-48a5-a2ea-9c1c2d6bc13d', 'c689ab00-8e44-45f1-b926-5f286582f894', 'ccdfcfa5-d6eb-4837-91b0-acaae358c85e', 'd165efed-98a3-484d-87d4-8f9c06d96cb1', 'e0629851-0379-4a9b-80d5-1b78b7c84569', 'e658a244-63ec-42b2-bc4a-e7565ca4a579', 'ea153145-d877-4893-acc2-b9c7f48ab005', 'ee4865b6-e75d-445e-8d99-4484750a3972', 'ef7cf8a1-5c7e-42e6-a214-7ea4bc771b3e', 'fef4534b-aa3d-40d9-9e6d-a36b0ab85468']",A novel active contour model based on modified symmetric cross entropy for remote sensing river image segmentation,Pattern Recognition,2017

Later, novel indicators are used to evaluate the subsequent technological feasibility of each new configuration under a customized analysis and prior combinations aided by a high score can be identified.

Actions to attract consumer attention are therefore integral components of a firm's competitive toolbox. In this paper, we study how the intensity and frequency of advertising is driven by the level of competition in the market.The empirical application is recorded music, where firms market songs via music videos and radio airplay to advertise for albums. In accordance with predictions from a simple theoretical model, we show that firms repeat marketing efforts faster and advertise more often when facing greater competitive pressure. We find different effects when looking at data from the pre-digital era, providing evidence that digitization, through more entry and forced unbundling of albums, has made markets move faster.","['Christian Essling', 'Johannes Koenen', 'Christian Peukert']",67081040-b860-442f-8528-ce912eb40b84,0,"['2ad5fc69-25b9-4c18-b92b-746a0d9c2ac9', '41509ab2-29ed-44b5-8b90-c3e394e2af0d', '4442221d-53a4-4fb9-b253-4e408439d27a', '81887a5d-35b4-4c4a-b78d-fc76f8643235', '95a85036-30ce-45df-8e3c-1d848256f393', 'b38b9cfa-9855-4c67-ad20-a994244b9f9b']",Competition for Attention in the Digital Age: The Case of Single Releases in the Recorded Music Industry,Information Economics and Policy,2017

569,"In modern sequential VLSI designs, clock tree plays an important role in synchronizing different components in a chip. To reduce peak current and power/ground noises caused by clock network, assigning different signal polarities to clock buffers is proposed in previous work. Although peak current and power/ground noises are minimized by signal polarities assignment, an assignment without timing information may increase the clock skew significantly. As a result, a timing-aware signal polarities assigning technique is necessary. In this article, we propose a novel signal polarities assigning technique which can not only reduce peak current and power/ground noises simultaneously but also render the clock skew in control. The experimental result shows that the clock skew produced by our algorithm is 94p of original clock skew in average while the clock skews produced by three algorithms (Partition, MST, Matching) in the absence of post clock tuning steps in the previous work are 235p, 272p, and 283p, respectively. Moreover, our algorithm is as efficient as the three algorithms of the previous work in reducing peak current and power/ground noises.","['Po-Yuan Chen', 'Kuan-Hsien Ho', 'TingTing Hwang']",e0835509-b67a-44f9-bc00-3361ef671fda,50,"['152911ea-b45a-4acd-8f3f-7b3f8ea57790', '4cb2775b-ea54-4e2b-a2f7-106d945d7908', 'b0f200f5-1393-4e60-aa25-b1ac343ad88a', 'b44c61e9-1c3f-49b3-bfed-aeff8a05ea8f', 'cc75ec75-5a33-4be9-8207-d267f914c7cf', 'e1580a8e-7ac3-4d30-bec5-fde0867e0991', 'e9398885-1df2-41f5-9f93-b5518b1ebc0a']",Skew-aware polarity assignment in clock tree,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,2009

571,"The prediction of future outcomes of a random phenomenon is typically based on a certain number of “analogous” observations from the past. When observations are generated by multiple samples, a natural notion of analogy is partial exchangeability and the problem of prediction can be effectively addressed in a Bayesian nonparametric setting. Instead of confining ourselves to the prediction of a single future experimental outcome, as in most treatments of the subject, we aim at predicting features of an unobserved additional sample of any size. We first provide a structural property of prediction rules induced by partially exchangeable arrays, without assuming any specific nonparametric prior. Then we focus on a general class of hierarchical random probability measures and devise a simulation algorithm to forecast the outcome of   m     m        future observations, for any   m≥1     m  ≥  1       .

572,"A flexible framework has been created for modeling multi-dimensional hydrological and water quality processes within stormwater green infrastructure (GI) practices. The framework conceptualizes GI practices using blocks (spatial features) and connectors (interfaces) representing functional components of a GI. The blocks represent spatial features with the ability to store water (e.g., pond, soil, benthic sediments, manhole, or a generic storage zone) and water quality constituents including chemical constituents and particles. The hydraulic module can solve a combination of Richards equation, kinematic/diffusive wave, Darcy, and other user-provided flow models. The particle transport module is based on performing mass-balance on particles in different phases, e.g., mobile and deposited in soil with constitutive theories controlling their transport, settling, deposition, and release. The reactive transport modules allow constituents to be in dissolved, sorbed, bound to particles, and undergo user-defined transformations. Four applications of the modeling framework are presented that demonstrate its flexibility for simulating urban GI performance.","['Arash Massoudieh', 'Mahdi Maghrebi', 'Babak Kamrani', 'Christopher T.

574,"The P-type ATPases (P-ATPases) are present in all living cells where they mediate ion transport across membranes on the expense of ATP hydrolysis. Different ions which are transported by these pumps are protons like calcium, sodium, potassium, and heavy metals such as manganese, iron, copper, and zinc. Maintenance of the proper gradients for essential ions across cellular membranes makes P-ATPases crucial for cell survival. In this study, characterization of two families of P-ATPases including P-ATPase 13A1 and P-ATPase 13A3 protein was compared in two different insect species from different orders. According to the conserved motifs found with MEME, nine motifs were shared by insects of 13A1 family but eight in 13A3 family. Seven different insect species from 13A1 and five samples from 13A3 family were selected as the representative samples for functional and structural analyses. The structural and functional analyses were performed with ProtParam, SOPMA, SignalP 4.1, TMHMM 2.0, ProtScale and ProDom tools in the ExPASy database. The tertiary structure of Bombus terrestris as a sample of each family of insects were predicted by the Phyre2 and TM-score servers and their similarities were verified by SuperPose server. The tertiary structures were predicted via the “c3b9bA” model (PDB Accession Code: 3B9B) in P-ATPase 13A1 family and “c2zxeA” model (PDB Accession Code: 2ZXE) in P-ATPase 13A3 family. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA 6.06 software using the Neighbor-joining method. According to the results, there was a high identity of P-ATPase families so that they should be derived from a common ancestor however they belonged to separate groups.

Previous studies about emotion analysis on texts written in Korean have focused generally on the basic sentiments such as positive/neutral/negative preferences or 4–10 emotion classes. In this paper, we propose an emotion analysis method based on supervised learning to classify various emotions from messages written in Korean. We had found the feature set optimized to each emotion class through evaluating the combinations of various linguistic features and built a model to classify the emotion using the optimized feature set. To do this, it was constructed the corpus that is manually annotated with 25 emotion classes. We performed a 10-fold cross variation experiment for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. Our method obtained F-value ranged from 73.1 to 98.0% for each of 25 emotion classes.

577,"In the context of efficient sound synthesis by digital waveguides, we present a novel methodology for joint modeling of string instrument body radiativity and driving-point bridge admittance functions, as obtained from experimental data. From our modeling framework, aimed at simulation of guitar and bowed string sound, here we focus on the body of the instrument and leave aside the strings. First, a modal decomposition of the measured bridge admittance is obtained by means of a novel frequency-domain algorithm for optimization of recursive digital filters in parallel form. Then, from extracted modal parameters, the radiativity, and admittance functions are modeled by projecting measurements over a common modal basis, enforcing passivity of the two-dimensional admittance model by means of semidefinite programming. We propose a formulation that enables the joint realization of bridge reflectance and sound radiativity as a lumped delay line termination in which a single bank of resonant filters is shared among all string reflection and body radiation outputs. Our approach provides efficient means to model two-dimensional (2-D) bridge reflectance, 2-D string–string coupling, sound radiation with an arbitrary number of outputs, and (implicitly) vibrational energy loss from the bridge transmittance to nonradiating modes and dissipation.","['Esteban Maestre', 'Gary P.

The main milestone is the generation of time series that measure the level of research activity and can be used for forecasting. The usefulness of this approach is shown by applying it to an emerging technology: cloud computing. The results enable the technology to be structured into five main sub-technologies which are characterised through five time series.

The proposed method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on several datasets, while it has a clear advantage in the case of articulated objects.","['Panagiotis Theologou', 'Ioannis Pratikakis', 'Theoharis Theoharis']",b9a40e47-7685-4ae1-8ed3-dbf1340275f9,0,"['022d7c6a-657c-4105-80e2-d8a7fd136142', '0e049938-b193-4330-a89b-041566318e40', '25283605-976c-4906-b6f5-81bbb20ae840', '3280a64e-b4ed-4abb-9da6-70fee424ae3d', '3c1e2a3d-8e8b-48a8-8edd-90c77b0f8706', '45dd7ab8-3e49-4091-b5cb-c8c7fa4f00a6', '463d3e22-8398-4847-89ad-bdb05a58cbc1', '486bcce7-7697-4e7c-8cb7-994ce4da40d0', '4bb431fb-64dd-4eba-803d-7917ac9752a3', '4cb2fc5d-5da0-47af-963e-a22fc56f35ee', '54b91dc8-417e-431a-87de-cb6954f845b0', '5a038a20-b271-4c7a-a04c-8976b95d763b', '5f2ed093-3653-4638-b6de-d2ec8c792f21', '63f33389-dca2-4de5-bed8-ae10bd6da9d8', '6ed5bd65-25a7-4873-a0ce-20e16f2899bf', '74de7811-bfd5-4801-9fad-4a6885aa7986', '75456d46-4dad-4e95-b3e7-561e70956e0b', '78b710b1-b286-4ac2-b7e1-0163485733ad', '844de0e7-3ed9-4697-8892-5359b1dab4de', '883d6e79-1350-42a6-8fff-37429ba4a81b', '8a2a4390-914f-4407-b506-095b477926b1', '96cef599-a86f-4758-b0bb-2f89a328c545', '989d7b4f-cdb9-46ce-b597-8e9584490d65', '9ef11d97-8bc6-43db-8bd7-27066ef829ff', 'a1fff80b-ff3f-463a-b0db-2e392cfb68e7', 'a80f1a0a-817c-401c-b694-6c65c87702f0', 'b497dcd4-dc96-4a9f-8159-ca36d704b404', 'becc3a37-5155-4224-b671-938d1cd0e31f', 'cdec6f76-8bc7-4f81-a095-84285f5c7167', 'd026079c-a16a-4667-afc9-1c34519f460a', 'd37d70f1-2d59-453d-9e83-37d9cb7c60ff', 'd840141d-e19c-4516-a728-6ae43ff8a902', 'dac4aedb-8045-4ef5-8d6a-23912af3d510', 'ea18d154-de4c-4976-beb4-3435f823e058', 'eac44870-7d5c-4021-96ca-7533ca115a88', 'ee4391a9-293c-4cf6-9f6c-50880ddd78c5']",Part-based 3D object retrieval via multi-label optimization,Computer Vision and Image Understanding,2017
580,"Rolling bearing tips are often the most susceptible to electro-mechanical system failure due to high-speed and complex working conditions, and recent studies on diagnosing bearing health using vibration data have developed an assortment of feature extraction and fault classification methods. Due to the strong non-linear and non-stationary characteristics, an effective and reliable deep learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) is investigated in this paper making use of cognitive computing theory, which introduces the advantages of image recognition and visual perception to bearing fault diagnosis by simulating the cognition process of the cerebral cortex. The novel feature representation method for bearing data is first discussed using supervised deep learning with the goal of identifying more robust and salient feature representations to reduce information loss. Next, the deep hierarchical structure is trained in a robust manner that is established using a transmitting rule of greedy training layer by layer. Convolution computation, rectified linear units, and sub-sampling are applied for weight replication and reducing the number of parameters that need to be learned to improve the general feed-forward back propagation training. The CNN model could thus reduce learning computation requirements in the temporal dimension, and an invariance level of working condition fluctuation and ambient noise is provided by identifying the elementary features of bearings. A top classifier followed by a back propagation process is used for fault classification. Contrast experiments and analyses have been undertaken to delineate the effectiveness of the CNN model for fault classification of rolling bearings.","['Chen Lu', 'Zhen-Ya Wang', 'Bo Zhou']",9421cd33-ceb6-41f8-8aef-20586d64bd78,0,"['0c10cb7d-1ae6-420a-b564-efb07f6ac56c', '1ccd5f83-c77a-4dc5-9748-84d032ceab5e', '32c1bdf2-cea7-4d60-8289-2207eaa41a77', '3715c870-6569-4d20-8797-af8569e5fde5', '3e6d1526-cb96-430e-a12b-a1ccd6a2874f', '4b398da2-eb03-4075-8bbd-253b3888f0e1', '4bbacb77-1097-4cc5-b001-6554ea01fb75', '712007a2-012d-44ce-bd94-7d47d0c286dd', '78b0ba4b-b8a0-4689-9972-cabab721ab40', '7b6a477e-fc2a-4158-9c4c-2ad9d65fa5a0', '81eb6b17-1396-479b-becf-006fe257338c', '89f10062-acf1-4171-b882-f3222c3a357e', '99de46a9-db0c-453f-9d36-d053fc443e5d', '9aa3689c-1150-4888-a79b-b014d8dd11a0', 'a2c0b7ee-74df-44b9-a22a-111d84bcc8ee', 'aa470a57-1dfe-435a-9e1f-8d8d49753d31', 'b78e6b16-b38d-4581-8d18-e95f3dd3f8f3', 'c2a31866-716b-4adf-a843-1c8f205af9a2', 'c436ca80-fe75-4614-9310-9857a8f61955', 'dacf4d44-702a-46ed-a485-510564d85dc9', 'f7ccb8e9-2dc9-4e34-ae3f-14dd04f79f6a', 'ff948282-ac63-40ea-821b-e32f748e1e3f']",Intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearing using hierarchical convolutional network based health state classification,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2017

A metamodel based multi-response objective-oriented sequential optimization was adopted, where Kriging models were updated with sequential training points. It was indicated that the sequential sampling strategy was able to obtain a much higher local accuracy in the neighborhood of the optimum and thus to yield a better optimum, although it did lead to a worse global accuracy over the entire design space. Furthermore, it was observed that the steel–aluminum hybrid structure was capable of decreasing the peak force and simultaneously enhancing the energy absorption, compared to the conventional mono-material structure.","['Jianguang Fang', 'Na Qiu', 'Xiuzhe An', 'Fenfen Xiong', 'Guangyong Sun', 'Qing Li']",1a65e9b0-f942-4bb0-9802-d2530d3a3aed,0,"['3c2dd6af-0684-4fe6-b3a3-e06a245fbbe2', '78278848-f57b-4810-ab76-9c1a228bed02', 'a0198ee7-5693-4769-9fcb-6d430687c718', 'a2a0d7ee-8fa9-46fe-9e0b-a2f3702e9af4', 'b9b789ba-c6e7-468c-a48b-a9aae7c12151', 'c132c954-2b23-402e-bd3e-3ec553778a2b', 'd2c1b95a-35e6-46cb-a940-ecdde1e24eea', 'e0476de1-12cf-45f3-8281-4ff72461a18d', 'f6da58be-f326-4cb1-b35e-17e959257d23']",Crashworthiness design of a steel–aluminum hybrid rail using multi-response objective-oriented sequential optimization,Advances in Engineering Software,2017

The regional deformation patterns produced by our 1D model are consistent with the transmural regional strain patterns obtained experimentally in the normal heart in vivo.

585,"Urban sprawl (US), propelled by rapid population growth leads to the shrinkage of productive agricultural lands and pristine forests in the suburban areas and, in turn, adversely affects the provision of ecosystem services. The quantification of US is thus crucial for effective urban planning and environmental management. Like many megacities in fast growing developing countries, Chennai, the capital of Tamilnadu and one of the business hubs in India, has experienced extensive US triggered by the doubling of total population over the past three decades. However, the extent and level of US has not yet been quantified and a prediction for future extent of US is lacking. We employed the Random Forest (RF) classification on Landsat imageries from 1991, 2003, and 2016, and computed six landscape metrics to delineate the extent of urban areas within a 10 km suburban buffer of Chennai. The level of US was then quantified using Renyi’s entropy. A land change model was subsequently used to project land cover for 2027. A 70.35% expansion in urban areas was observed mainly towards the suburban periphery of Chennai between 1991 and 2016. The Renyi’s entropy value for year 2016 was 0.9, exhibiting a two-fold level of US when compared to 1991. The spatial metrics values indicate that the existing urban areas became denser and the suburban agricultural, forests and particularly barren lands were transformed into fragmented urban settlements. The forecasted land cover for 2027 indicates a conversion of 13,670.33 ha (16.57% of the total landscape) of existing forests and agricultural lands into urban areas with an associated increase in the entropy value to 1.7, indicating a tremendous level of US. Our study provides useful metrics for urban planning authorities to address the social-ecological consequences of US and to protect ecosystem services.","['Rajchandar Padmanaban', 'Avit Kumar Bhowmik', 'Pedro Cabral', 'Alexander Zamyatin', 'Oraib Almegdadi', 'Shuangao Wang']",9ec56fec-a3d5-432f-8b26-0eebd5c8792c,0,"['13ab4c3b-c21c-4cac-95bf-4212f52b3aa8', '2c778553-efd6-441d-98f3-ac68ce8220d3', '36f9e3e7-6ff2-433e-a85d-cc73a929a1ca', '8731eb70-ab2e-41d5-af99-cb9caf0e2af9', 'a667e5b2-9d0f-47f1-a2d0-3549519c8172', 'd326d2e2-bf87-421d-8549-4ab6885c8dc0']","Modelling Urban Sprawl Using Remotely Sensed Data: A Case Study of Chennai City, Tamilnadu",Entropy,2017

587,"For future 3D TV broadcasting systems and navigation applications, it is necessary to have accurate stereo matching which could precisely estimate depth map from two distanced cameras. In this paper, we first suggest a trinary cross color (TCC) census transform, which can help to achieve accurate disparity raw matching cost with low computational cost. The two-pass cost aggregation (TPCA) is formed to compute the aggregation cost, then the disparity map can be obtained by a range winner-take-all (RWTA) process and a white hole filling procedure. To further enhance the accuracy performance, a range left-right checking (RLRC) method is proposed to classify the results as correct, mismatched, or occluded pixels. Then, the image-based refinements for the mismatched and occluded pixels are proposed to refine the classified errors. Finally, the image-based cross voting and a median filter are employed to complete the fine depth estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed semi-global stereo matching system achieves considerably accurate disparity maps with reasonable computation cost.","['Ting-An Chang', 'Xiao Lu', 'Jar-Ferr Yang']",55692c2a-c4a4-4b72-a030-aba036e50657,0,"['082f8cbf-e738-41ce-80dd-15672bf29a4f', '1f520d1a-5870-477d-85d7-0f50be690ea7', '3d03c11d-2946-49f6-9b48-91294b31e4f9', '3f401a82-6ca2-4e9c-9016-d6e0a09af00e', '44e253c5-3b86-48bf-98f8-8be2036cb4ab', '5306173b-7a52-4727-9b21-5d9c3c0fc664', '6a4b9ecc-e51f-46fb-bdd8-edafd6b83e93', '6d5affd5-cddd-408b-a1f7-e01d024ccacf', '88832f31-3a8a-4699-a2b9-262cfd1d9bbb', '8dd6e238-ac99-4f82-9a55-018fb210d3f7', '9cffbb71-c056-4074-9309-8670cb1c6307', 'aff31c10-57ea-4299-a98e-440e01aecf0c', 'bb138fb8-d3a9-497a-879d-b21aa7347b53', 'e4bc8fb1-acb6-478e-9ddc-00e8ff3e86ec', 'e927dff1-6ed4-45fd-8852-eb804e11e665', 'f6326193-ef92-4e64-8a4e-7439f8692fa1', 'f83e631e-a902-4182-8cea-2108b8a8dae7', 'f9eabc0e-fd60-435f-9a51-c670e2302b12']",Robust stereo matching with trinary cross color census and triple image-based refinements,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,2017
588,"This work focuses on robust clustering of data affected by imprecision. The imprecision is managed in terms of fuzzy sets. The clustering process is based on the fuzzy and possibilistic approaches. In both approaches the observations are assigned to the clusters by means of membership degrees. In fuzzy clustering the membership degrees express the degrees of sharing of the observations to the clusters. In contrast, in possibilistic clustering the membership degrees are degrees of typicality. These two sources of information are complementary because the former helps to discover the best fuzzy partition of the observations while the latter reflects how well the observations are described by the centroids and, therefore, is helpful to identify outliers. First, a fully possibilistic k-means clustering procedure is suggested.

590,"Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a wireless technology used in various applications to minimize the complexity of everyday life. However, it opens a large number of security and privacy issues that require to be addressed before its successful deployment. Many RFID authentication protocols are proposed in recent years to address security and privacy issues, and most of them are based on lightweight cryptographic techniques such as pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs), or bitwise logical operations. However, the existing RFID authentication protocols suffer from security weaknesses, and cannot solve most of the security and privacy problems. A new solution is necessary to address security and privacy issues. In this paper, an improved three-pass mutual authentication protocol (ITPMAP) for low-cost RFID tags is proposed to offer an adequate security level for RFID systems. The proposed ITPMAP protocol uses one PRNG on the tag side and heavy-weighted cryptographic techniques (i.e., digital signature and password-based encryption schemes) on the back-end server side instead of lightweight cryptographic techniques to address the security and privacy issues. The ITPMAP protocol is secure against various attacks such as cloning, spoofing, replay, and desynchronization attacks. Furthermore, as a proof of concept, the ITPMAP protocol is adopted to propose the design of three real-life RFID systems; namely: Signing and Verification of Graduation Certificate System, issuing and verification of e-ticketing system, and charging and discharging of prepaid card system. The Unified Modeling Language is used to demonstrate the design of the proposed ITPMAP protocol and systems. Java language is used for the implementation of the proposed systems. In addition, the “Mifare Classic” tags and readers are used as RFID apparatuses for the proposed systems.","['Mohammed Issam Younis', 'Mustafa Hashim Abdulkareem']",fbb49018-2310-4a7e-abae-4e696b047949,0,"['03f2dd52-ad3e-43d8-856b-592105958b4a', '1bc09315-a9c3-4019-bf1b-cae91f2c1b1f', '2526970e-00aa-49a9-8f2a-ee3fc99303ba', '2d522ace-5a14-4e32-8752-5603c0a2db5e', '4fd4d651-fc6a-466a-9bc1-789aae2b850c', '58493774-eef5-46ac-bd7c-2e389cbb5e40', '676368fe-b889-4949-831d-3900f391b9a5', '709cea54-a71b-41d4-b208-5b601f69cc44', '7ac978c9-348d-48bf-abdf-de6c68362715', '88bd0d3c-825a-4d65-8647-b7ed13e4a067', '9211ce55-7c93-4f61-ad03-4e10091f7160', '9711cc51-cd9b-4f09-a70a-4c39aeb938a4', 'ab3591e5-d5bb-4d28-a0f3-20b6d64e932a', 'ba786144-c606-4cc3-8136-006279802cfe', 'bb8860c1-b707-4409-a912-f33128ff5391', 'c4189e31-ffc3-4295-be97-e1d99cd3a858', 'ccf4f81d-a44d-462f-a9c4-5c7312fb8d63', 'e27486c7-8e16-4010-9227-a68d803096d4', 'ea7a3299-1fbc-4ded-932c-319c0256fcfa', 'f2a9c760-7a4d-4e26-ac28-612f4da65d6b', 'fbce2eec-8eb3-45bc-87e1-2d272fe15af1', 'fe199b8b-5061-4486-9c5d-75431fa3e9fe']",ITPMAP: An Improved Three-Pass Mutual Authentication Protocol for Secure RFID Systems,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
591,"We propose empirical dynamic programming algorithms for Markov decision processes. In these algorithms, the exact expectation in the Bellman operator in classical value iteration is replaced by an empirical estimate to get “empirical value iteration” (EVI). Policy evaluation and policy improvement in classical policy iteration are also replaced by simulation to get “empirical policy iteration” (EPI). Thus, these empirical dynamic programming algorithms involve iteration of a random operator, the empirical Bellman operator. We introduce notions of probabilistic fixed points for such random monotone operators. We develop a stochastic dominance framework for convergence analysis of such operators. We then use this to give sample complexity bounds for both EVI and EPI. We then provide various variations and extensions to asynchronous empirical dynamic programming, the minimax empirical dynamic program, and show how this can also be used to solve the dynamic newsvendor problem. Preliminary experimental results suggest a faster rate of convergence than stochastic approximation algorithms.","['William B. Haskell', 'Rahul Jain', 'Dileep M.

592,"This paper studies direction of arrival (DoA) estimation with an antenna array using sparse signal reconstruction (SSR). Among the existing SSR methods, the sparse covariance fitting based algorithms, which can estimate source power and noise variance naturally, are most promising. Nevertheless, they are either on-grid model based methods whose performance are sensitive to off-grid DoAs or gridless methods which are computationally demanding. In this paper, we propose an off-grid DoA estimation algorithm based on the sparse covariance fitting criterion. We first consider a scenario in which the number of snapshots is larger than the array size. An algorithm is proposed by applying an off-grid model, which takes into account the deviations between the discretized sampling grid and the true DoAs, to the sparse covariance fitting criterion. It estimates the on-grid parameters and the deviations of off-grid DoAs separately and thus is computationally efficient to implement. Then in the case where the number of snapshots is smaller than the array size, we propose to execute the DoA estimation algorithm iteratively under the stochastic maximum likelihood (SML) criterion. The estimation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by computer simulations.","['Shu Cai', 'Gang Wang', 'Jun Zhang', 'Kai-Kit Wong', 'Hongbo Zhu']",117cc9c4-c4ee-4f4b-acf0-8fb1308cc0da,0,"['0faa8507-eabc-4af4-aa72-c7dea39ede0d', '137110b2-efd8-4a91-a3fa-44d4b33a929f', '15c84b8a-36c7-45f1-b344-c001eea3c0c6', '1a77aa56-c4f8-466f-a1e6-e6b538199858', '21b3ce3d-2c53-4c0a-9564-36363b128696', '24ab1159-fecf-4182-a460-62fcf0e18be8', '29a9bad1-ab18-4495-96b6-79d87bbd859f', '413fc9ab-9539-4cc0-a131-ed4f95e2fcdd', '48dd5180-86fe-46eb-9866-b0e8ff777f87', '4d18d7a8-53d6-487c-987b-b435ecfea664', '4fc9b9d9-8739-428d-b650-42210ccb8273', '5382cfd0-d320-4dbe-9eb4-78a83d6d66ec', '5e933208-5548-4550-a93c-e6965e5ef7d6', '646d2b4c-cde3-4484-839a-46280d3dbade', '6d68faca-83ea-4c4f-8950-51af1e3d45b2', '6df29b52-a5c8-4ebc-82e0-641df31a7925', '7d63a89b-8912-4109-88cf-e3c756d988f3', '7e9cfb50-9410-41aa-b2b9-81755a6e3704', '864e7381-572e-4867-a826-8d9c3a87418d', '9ec51dea-b1bb-49cc-9e36-9a13dfcadd52', 'b877e3f9-4cd4-49ec-878c-aa585068a0ea', 'c4480d0e-2a9d-4e9f-902c-c1a225448960', 'cc6a5107-b71e-438e-ad2a-c42fc3f7a9da', 'deee8ed7-e261-47aa-823f-6b9b194f91be', 'e08a7619-06ea-43ea-8078-0cf79f7bb7ec', 'ee9078cc-6b23-4f88-a639-c255570322ac']",Efficient direction of arrival estimation based on sparse covariance fitting criterion with modeling mismatch,Signal Processing,2017

We first develop a new Markov chain model to analyze the back-off process for different applications with hidden nodes problem. Then based on the analytical model, we derive a few MAC layer performance metrics such as MAC layer packet dropping probability, the mean throughput and the mean packet delay which contains the queuing delay. Finally, the proposed analytical model is validated via comparing the analytical results with simulation results by ns-3 in NAN scenarios with various applications. We observe a good match between the analytical model and simulations which confirms the veracity of our model.","['Xiaoheng Deng', 'Tingting He', 'Lifang He', 'Jinsong Gui', 'Qionglin Peng']",a6888e2e-931c-42fd-911a-b63c41e631b0,0,"['0301343d-0e08-48ea-959f-7c0b5910dd77', '10da5f6c-678e-4489-9cfd-4b91ee65e7f6', '116bdf1a-6486-4d57-bb3f-6cace9a8be89', '17f70e89-85f1-45bc-86dd-2e31c1fcc87b', '193c8652-0884-4376-9e5c-9de5582bcc98', '1a3a157e-cddc-4298-afb6-873bc7d9d394', '21aa9037-a274-4ebc-87a6-e1deaf8fe04d', '270ac415-7720-4b32-b2ca-e303561b943a', '288a969c-819a-4da6-a6e1-4461a9724b0e', '32c9677f-8878-427b-903b-c9aebbc71c17', '368e336b-38e6-4877-82b3-5768e0c41be7', '3abc0792-2f9c-46ed-9955-3418460d257e', '53b3cb1a-6f0d-415e-ab0a-8bfd8ee656f8', '571a7c86-7f18-460e-b11b-7d72c350ef97', '578ed629-39db-4a55-a7ec-2a57aaa34971', '8742b527-28c5-45bf-bbb2-8324400fa5ca', '8ca15b8a-e049-4bb5-b3c7-1c5e078d9e61', 'a9f4cb12-a63b-4dfd-9738-9c3f8c501516', 'b857298c-92c9-4f05-a704-3b9fc6be06e3', 'b9a1f29e-0f4a-4829-84ac-be853f26a23d', 'd991fa4e-9818-4554-802f-757d8d2f90c8', 'da62b2a8-99c2-4d97-901f-05c924e13d69', 'df9da54d-7e74-472d-a5fa-19f5edd8e935', 'e1c1ea2a-f510-42ae-8a03-9547adac476d', 'eaa3c6b2-de21-474b-8398-cd84800310d4']",Performance Analysis for IEEE 802.11s Wireless Mesh Network in Smart Grid,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
594,"Since few universities can afford to be excellent in all subject areas, university administrators face the difficult decision of selecting areas for strategic investment. While the past decade has seen a proliferation of university ranking systems, several aspects in the design of most ranking systems make them inappropriate to benchmark performance in a way that supports formulation of effective institutional research strategy. To support strategic decision making, universities require research benchmarking data that is sufficiently fine-grained to show variation among specific research areas and identify focused areas of excellence; is objective and verifiable; and provides meaningful comparisons across the diversity of national higher education environments. This paper describes the Global Research Benchmarking System (GRBS) which satisfies these requirements by providing fine-grained objective data to internationally benchmark university research performance in over 250 areas of Science and Technology. We provide analyses of research performance at country and university levels, using the diversity of indicators in GRBS to examine distributions of research quality in countries and universities as well as to contrast university research performance from volume and quality perspectives. A comparison of the GRBS results with those of the three predominant ranking systems shows how GRBS is able to identify pockets of excellence within universities that are overlooked by the more traditional aggregate level approaches.","['Peter Haddawy', 'Saeed-Ul Hassan', 'Craig W.

595,"Constantly advancing integration capability is paving the way for the construction of the extremely large scale continuum of the Internet where entities or things from vastly varied domains are uniquely addressable and interacting seamlessly to form a giant networked system of systems known as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). In contrast to this visionary networked system paradigm, prior research efforts on the IoT are still very fragmented and confined to disjoint explorations of different applications, architecture, security, services, protocol, and economical domains, thus preventing design exploration and optimization from a unified and global perspective.

597,"Recommender systems for  online broadcasting  become important as the number of channels has been increasing. In online broadcasting, to provide accurate recommendation, recommender systems should take time factors as well as users’ condition into account, but the conventional systems don’t. This paper proposes a real-time recommender system for online broadcasting called  RecTime  which considers time factors and preferences simultaneously. Specifically,  RecTime  employs a 4-d tensor factorization, which considers two more dimensions regarding the time factors, while typical collaboriative filtering methods only consider two dimensions, users and items. By factorizing the 4-d tensor, the system naturally identifies the recommendation time and the items at the same time. In our experiments on real-world data,  RecTime  properly models users’ watching patterns and significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of the accuracy on the recommendation time as well as the items.","['Yoojin Park', 'Jinoh Oh', 'Hwanjo Yu']",34af7cc6-1697-4ed5-99a9-a173560bd691,0,"['0887bd77-eaf5-488c-9a68-7e482c4c65a7', '136c8788-4516-4eb1-9685-e18c0fb9825f', '1b185f48-ea34-4bf0-ac43-5c39f1253388', '1f5836fe-d033-4353-8da0-8005dd73c338', '20313470-81cd-4cd8-99ce-116569d0878b', '23f66d97-4abf-479f-8af5-ec833d850a24', '356f5736-4803-4de2-a010-1ddf0df10719', '37b6c58c-ae2d-408e-9186-d85c896224dd', '3be2ed7e-9c26-45f9-82aa-5ce8bdaae4c0', '4d004d00-c14f-4962-b789-8bfeb876ed79', '50e0fcf4-57d9-4ed6-ad7d-c9eb2bad8e42', '57faca92-1a32-45de-8397-1ae103d80445', '58055484-1f0a-4c78-bc69-3130fdc75445', '75951c61-a613-4fa1-aa06-92507534d559', '7d2f1288-2653-49e0-a1f5-a982da808862', '7e57ae60-e251-4b47-b6b3-a0d2f55768d6', '88dafc89-11e1-4ada-98e3-82aff2a904e7', '9ae0142d-b12f-42b1-ac48-d655fdec233f', 'a77a3dc2-422e-49d1-b740-c5a050d6675f', 'a9fec7a0-92a9-4613-a11f-70ead60368c5', 'ab032919-a6c9-4e30-909d-111fd0c0b77d', 'ad89db70-8ded-4159-950a-74666bf409bb', 'adb377c1-448b-48a4-8ce1-ca716440caa1', 'b8bd4104-ee30-4c8f-8c27-a829894fb2be', 'b93cddb1-9407-40c5-9add-94a782c19555', 'b9c65602-17dd-4b67-bc8c-426565d898e3', 'c69ef004-087e-486c-97c9-9b4587d0b10a', 'd107e07f-36e3-42a0-bf50-d5a6fe64943f', 'de67e9e2-82dc-4521-9e3a-c5e22ba4bf80', 'e2208c4b-7006-4f8e-830c-2c7e528ae199', 'e6ae0c3d-0683-4587-b7b2-1a6dbcf7748b', 'e6b748d5-f789-4459-bdbe-1b605a9192ea', 'e93113ce-b77e-405d-93d7-c061386d2738', 'eae19d34-df16-4b3f-80d9-0809a84b6892', 'ed4c0d5d-5152-4915-b9bd-d0bd25f82674', 'f48eee6b-7421-48bc-92ea-b571bef6af20', 'fadcb326-4ec0-4dca-b707-f49cc88a5930']",RecTime: Real-Time Recommender System for Online Broadcasting,Information Sciences,2017
598,"Cloud detection plays an important role in climate models, climate predictions, and meteorological services. Although researchers have given increasing efforts on cloud detection, the performance is still unsatisfactory due to the diverse nature of clouds. Considering the fact that one source of information (color or texture) is not enough to segment cloud from clear sky, in this letter, we propose a novel ground-based cloud detection method using graph model (GM) built upon superpixels to integrate multiple sources of information. First, we use the superpixel segmentation to divide the image into a series of subregions according to the color similarity and spatial continuity. Next, adjacent superpixels are merged according to their similarity of extracted features. Finally, we build a GM on the merged superpixels by considering each superpixel as a node and adding edges between neighboring ones. The unary cost is set according to the classification score of Random Forests, while pairwise cost reflects the penalties for color and texture discontinuity between neighboring components. The final segmentation could be acquired by minimizing the cost function. Moreover, the algorithm is computationally efficient as we use the superpixels rather than raw pixels as computation units. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for cloud detection.","['Cunzhao Shi', 'Yu Wang', 'Chunheng Wang', 'Baihua Xiao']",a6b23068-8f34-4a76-b677-1af934da7d56,0,"['4b9c17d1-9a08-48a2-95e0-47d3d4452a96', '574fb559-b34b-4578-a013-c7b31ad910a0', '94bb2ecf-bfae-43ea-aeba-cb704c8f8e30', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'dc29d1b2-4d20-4de7-a869-341e08ffd537', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6']",Ground-Based Cloud Detection Using Graph Model Built Upon Superpixels,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
599,"Our paper by adopting the latest advances on the probabilistic characterization of directional distance functions as has been introduced by Daraio and Simar (2014), develops a Malmquist productivity index and presents its main decompositions. Specifically, the proposed productivity index is based on the probabilistic version of directional distance functions which are expressed as transformations of radial distances. We illustrate how these indexes can be computed and how different components can be derived. Specifically, we demonstrate how a probabilistic version of the following categories of change can be obtained: technical, efficiency, pure efficiency, scale efficiency, scale change factor and scale bias of technical change. Finally, we apply the probabilistic productivity indexes alongside with their decompositions to inputs/outputs data from a sample of 644 banks from 28 European countries between the years 2007, 2010 and 2014. The results suggest that the EU banks’ productivity levels remained relative unchanged from the initiation of U.S. prime crisis and during the EU sovereign debt crisis. Finally, during the U.S. prime crisis and the Global Financial Crisis, banks’ maintained their productivity levels by utilizing better their inputs and by exploiting scale economies. However, during the sovereign debt crisis banks maintained their productivity levels by investing on financial engineering competences.","['Ilias Kevork', 'Jenny Pange', 'Panayiotis Tzeremes', 'Nickolaos G.

602,"Consider the single-group multicast beamforming problem, where multiple users receive the same data stream simultaneously from a single transmitter. The problem is NP-hard and all existing algorithms for the problem either find suboptimal approximate or local stationary solutions. In this paper, we propose an efficient branch-and-bound algorithm for the problem that is guaranteed to find its global solution. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed algorithm is the first tailored global algorithm for the single-group multicast beamforming problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is computationally efficient (albeit its theoretical worst-case iteration complexity is exponential with respect to the number of receivers) and it significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art general-purpose global optimization solver called Baron. Our proposed algorithm provides an important benchmark for performance evaluation of existing algorithms for the same problem. By using it as the benchmark, we show that two state-of-the-art algorithms, semidefinite relaxation algorithm and successive linear approximation algorithm, work well when the problem dimension (i.e., the number of antennas at the transmitter and the number of receivers) is small but their performance deteriorates quickly as the problem dimension increases.","['Cheng Lu', 'Ya-Feng Liu']",e223efa9-dc39-46d4-b796-d7e119dfe492,0,"['109b1a9c-4316-4137-ae35-ad9e97f288b0', '1368bc97-3a14-4213-ad14-d0f4b104df72', '147cc7ee-cf84-4cf9-b2a0-ab2da2912ac8', '14c09721-9f04-42b4-9def-086a2c53225a', '17d20f9d-aad8-44db-b1b3-b99166224e1f', '1d6e09e1-a386-48b8-87be-af6b0b03af83', '2208a33b-b6b7-4ff8-869e-26831900f515', '2aa42502-5876-4df9-b518-aa092d356c3e', '2cc6123e-c12a-4f2e-a266-d2e1d7f6ad4c', '2f6ccd2b-0039-40c3-95b2-623e432b80e4', '3f6c1a02-1157-4eef-8d65-c28e0f523139', '4385d333-4188-42e0-ab10-76ef57c76096', '4400db99-2378-4d7d-9675-606580737a13', '4a8822f1-4051-4718-bd6b-74a46bf9be7f', '4f4ce365-ec48-4a05-8f1a-74a1f20f6e9a', '4fe9eea8-6105-4f5f-bc19-197a5038acff', '5f7d3e4c-ee5e-4264-8c8f-89baadcb8472', '6c3d1155-ff40-4fef-b553-910facb563f1', '7757c456-2228-416d-955d-c7a2eaf65e7a', '84143300-9d8a-450b-912e-07c69c390c8b', '9361f802-d00d-44a7-9c57-fafedb9ccfd8', '9cc005bd-9a85-4627-80b3-9c221f824c92', 'b3f20a16-1715-4d56-944d-35d02039c375', 'b9d1a9a6-8297-4cf1-ac5a-224c88f36134', 'be2fd38c-7934-43ed-a3c3-77454944edc9', 'c2dbe619-2126-445b-9d80-3132f3517aec', 'd67d1078-0286-4496-a6fc-cc090dc6481d', 'dbdbf36a-8fda-49a6-9641-a208481d6d52', 'e05e1d75-2f4d-4af6-bc71-d7fb79f9b8bc']",An Efficient Global Algorithm for Single-Group Multicast Beamforming,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2017

A survey questionnaire method was adopted to collect data from students in five public universities in Malaysia. An analysis of 1165 questionnaires shows that all five dimensions of personality from big five model predict academic performance. In addition, shyness also predicted academic performance positively while a negative relationship was found between loneliness and students’ academic performance. The mediating role of Facebook usage was established only in the relationships of academic performance with extraversion, agreeableness and loneliness. A discussion of these findings, limitations of the study and future research directions are provided.","['M.

605,"To process rapidly growing Big Data, many organizations migrate their data and services such as e-voting and e-payment systems to the cloud. In these two systems, blind signature has become an essential cryptographic primitive since it allows the signer to sign a message without learning what he signs. Thus, it can guarantee trustworthy of Big Data. However, most blind signature schemes based on factoring and discrete logarithm problems cannot resist quantum computer attacks. The alternative blind signature schemes are based on lattice. Here, we present a round-optimal lattice-based blind signature scheme constructed on the closest vector problem using infinity norm. Firstly, our scheme is proven blind and one-more unforgeable, and is resistant to brute-force attacks, theoretical-timing attacks, and Nguyen–Regev attacks. Secondly, our scheme outperforms the RSA, the Schnorr, and the ECC blind signature schemes in terms of efficiency and security. Also, it outperforms the Ruckert’s blind signature in terms of signature length, moves, and security. Finally, our scheme outperforms the Ruckert’s blind signature in terms of communication and computation energy costs. Additionally, it outperforms the RSA blind signature in terms of communication energy cost.","['Hongfei Zhu', 'Yu-an Tan', 'Xiaosong Zhang', 'Liehuang Zhu', 'Changyou Zhang', 'Jun Zheng']",7aec4073-5779-43fd-b621-0da531dbf42f,50,"['04f43dd3-5b40-4cc4-9e2e-3f5904c477d1', '1109fb00-b3b9-4b6b-a3a9-483f09bde996', '12c12797-37d7-436e-8311-4621cad0338b', '14922d15-377d-4f05-a2fc-6660723b797a', '1b2b0314-f94f-43da-99b1-87d5df39e89c', '23260556-8c80-4e78-82e5-dd04179c1d5d', '25e71241-6b5d-4689-a095-b84b797f4e04', '2ca20f25-46d5-40db-a926-ccef55736f5c', '3be272cc-18a9-4385-a5e5-542c8861bdb9', '3c59c31f-6fcf-400a-85b2-dfda9ce285fc', '42e38257-f624-4d8b-a577-7f4c87183a7d', '47a34c94-e9af-4b5d-8845-bd1be8d9e4df', '4e37db7d-dbd4-4d1a-9c2e-29bbcd6bbfc5', '5ab8dbd8-d760-41db-ab35-3afa27f6edc6', '65031a5c-0e9d-4d2a-a2af-97f32dfe0c14', '6a4157e6-fd32-499e-9983-cd1a3a610ba5', '70dbb4b1-0d46-4581-92cf-343058f00418', '863c65bb-a69c-4deb-a041-61ea8b9860e7', '89c523ca-4ee4-493c-9921-1a24d999e756', '93b84c61-0636-4d00-8d2b-ce6353f8c8d6', '9472db48-6ed2-4936-ab27-3a3f14c36ef9', '9926b5f9-b6c0-4ee4-8149-8022ca8bc9f4', '9b84a3b9-6740-417f-9ff5-82fda95bec33', '9f6186e9-49bd-4b47-a4d5-9bdfbb83c2ce', 'a2d44924-da50-4425-b384-4ff06178e32c', 'a631ca46-80fd-43dd-8b81-987050c883ca', 'a9750be4-7f0e-4ddf-a3d7-790efe117a3d', 'c03d2f84-d383-4ba9-a430-c943bf1f9de4', 'ccf5c85f-9ccc-40dd-b8c1-752836c16075', 'e069a5e8-a57c-4420-b4e0-3b3406fd9d66', 'e135738e-3e0a-4a8f-b933-9ae9745987ec', 'f045bf8a-f8dd-4c60-973c-05854a2361e2', 'f13fe55e-8757-42cc-ae9c-fba6939034cc', 'f26f9480-cb27-4cca-8fe0-4aa047f0bab6', 'f3e676fd-bbaa-4336-abbd-a7a34b515b07', 'f5511266-129c-4c4e-a799-9da35807f832', 'f5a0a1dc-4927-477f-aad8-872ec0d2851b', 'f6858160-3e3d-477b-9c81-c639a511c16b', 'f8e7129e-fcc6-4f9a-bdcb-d9b35c5da0ed']",A round-optimal lattice-based blind signature scheme for cloud services,Future Generation Computer Systems,2017
606,"Firms have made extensive use of interorganizational systems (IOSs) to share knowledge and pursue superior joint performance. Contemporary firms are using IOSs to collaborate widely across the value chain and in an ever-expanding geographic landscape. Thus, institutional distance, which is the difference between the firms’ respective institutional fields, has become a prominent challenge. In this study, we investigate the extent to which institutional distance affects IOS-enabled knowledge sharing and its impact on the joint performance of collaborating firms. We also explore the extent to which IOS adaptability could be a design solution for improving IOS-enabled knowledge sharing, given the challenge of institutional distance. Drawing on institutional theory, we propose that institutional distance, differentially influential via its normative, cognitive, and regulative aspects, not only reduces IOS-enabled knowledge sharing but also weakens the positive impact of such sharing on joint firm performance. ...","['Maggie Chuoyan Dong', 'Yulin Fang', 'Detmar W.

607,"3D video for tele-medicine applications is gradually gaining momentum since the 3D technology can provide precise location information. However, the weak link for 3D video streaming is the necessary wireless link of the communication system. Neglecting the wireless impairments can severely degrade the performance of 3D video streaming that communicates complex critical medical data. In this paper, we propose systematic methodology for ensuring high performance of the 3D medical video streaming system. First, we present a recursive end-to-end distortion estimation approach for MVC(multiview video coding)-based 3D video streaming over error-prone networks by considering the 3D inter-view prediction. Then, based on the previous model, we develop a cross-layer optimization scheme that considers the LTE wireless physical layer (PHY). In this optimization, the authentication requirements of 3D medical video are also taken into account. The proposed cross-layer optimization approach jointly controls and manages the authentication, video coding quantization of 3D video, and the modulation and channel coding scheme (MCS) of the LTE wireless PHY to minimize the end-to-end video distortion. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can provide superior 3D medical video streaming performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when compared to state-of-the-art approaches that include joint source-channel optimized streaming with multi-path hash-chaining based-authentication, and also conventional video streaming with single path hash-chaining-based authentication.","['Yanwei Liu', 'Jinxia Liu', 'Antonios Argyriou', 'Song Ci']",d1593741-49df-49cd-ab85-89c2d73b767f,50,"['0432efe5-6a0a-40df-86db-cb5e64d6bafb', '244aa0a9-c182-4202-84e0-7e62b2b09ff6', '2a9ecf85-6576-41ed-8db6-754bdec3151f', '3edc651f-0323-4ccc-9bef-9492faa4aa80', '41bf274c-90aa-480c-a2e3-b54963424277', '6cee9a3b-02bb-4abd-8308-e669710ab3b7', '6fb9ec47-d9c5-4f63-9580-ad3c69628c73', '7f299854-bb57-4338-832f-1d00a4188133', '8020aede-0a1a-49d9-96f1-be46c7259665', '8628a1cf-e2af-4db1-b5b9-19019b97c0c1', '8c7a3036-6161-430c-8ff8-85b3b9cd8ad1', '9cae745e-3bef-43d5-8bab-14fa0153be58', 'c0cd2d54-da9a-44e4-a465-9b4413ca0cec', 'c2ce06ce-aae9-4eca-a175-11d33cffe64e', 'c7048f91-2cac-4f7b-a1a2-00957f9d78cc', 'cb43e76e-caeb-403d-b1d5-96503a362e3d', 'd8880787-ec65-4dee-b1a1-ecae387abf6f', 'dfa14a3c-185e-47b9-bd5d-573fc64a4cbe', 'e0c31065-d624-4c9c-90ef-52058dd662e7', 'e3819b61-fb1f-4eeb-9e06-c9e3239d61e9', 'ea1098f0-dd5f-4e2d-af36-fb9c14c86457', 'ee09f76c-3f16-4ec9-80a2-e2e6ee08c13c', 'ee57a054-9245-426f-8a30-996025842b8e', 'f602d276-cbb1-4429-bf3e-20561e8a0e7d', 'fb5fd18c-4b61-40bf-a87f-89c3be3df52f']",Cross-layer optimized Authentication and Error Control for Wireless 3D Medical Video Streaming over LTE,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017
608,"With the rapid development of science technology, finding prevalent spatial patterns from urban facility data has gradually become an important issue in smart city applications. Co-location pattern mining is a valid method for identifying patterns whose instances are prevalent in geographical proximity. However, existing methods treat the space as homogeneous and non-directional, and both the proximity levels and connecting directions of instances are neglected during the mining process, causing the minded patterns to be unsatisfactory. Tobler's First Law indicates that the contributions of instances to their pattern's significance diminish as the distance decreases. Moreover, the directions in which instances are connected should also be considered due to the distance decay effects. Following these threads, this paper proposes a novel co-location pattern mining algorithm mixed with a density-weighted distance thresholding consideration. Based on the framework of our previous SGCT algorithm, which concentrates on efficiency and storage issues, this solution comprises an extension called SGCT-K, which is mainly concerned with improving the effectiveness of the mined results. It adopts a kernel-density-estimation-based model to measure the proximity level of different instance types and respects their directions during the instance connecting process. We implement experiments using both synthetic and real-facility datasets in Beijing, China. The results provide sound evidence that the algorithm improves both accuracy and sensitivity compared to previous methods.","['Xiaojing Yao', 'Liujia Chen', 'Ling Peng', 'Tianhe Chi']",1170d80c-4751-43de-b405-1fc49fe2a87d,0,"['021e09e3-6001-4ce1-9bfd-0107ca1ba70d', '07488a8c-29ed-4f56-80c6-974a341a8a8e', '0a4cc173-14d2-4f3c-8b11-7061d83e7bda', '0ec5e0fd-60b2-4811-a3de-be325f271738', '10b4e85c-980b-4efe-93f4-6101b7b3e78b', '13acec43-448b-4908-9b3e-fc3b2bf467a6', '34b7e270-80d7-46d5-a6f1-e50087a8d045', '38644bfb-620c-436c-bda3-4448752972f7', '44af191c-4d0f-4451-ada0-344b83be82c3', '6a5273a3-c4b4-4bfa-9937-cb7f1ceb0bf8', '6b6b2732-1cf0-45f7-b539-561bd4e21af5', '7bedd95a-1e5c-4a4e-8bf6-b7e8249ea21b', '876da4cc-cca6-4919-8657-87b3b08dd8c5', '890010bc-f29b-4a60-8d80-b2fefdb01f5b', '921d7d95-7eec-4009-8f52-d9f38089c39b', '92629fd9-0e9c-434e-9c2e-4aa95956df73', '97d40811-cf9d-4193-8703-89e6eff322d5', 'a879c41a-24ad-4994-a8fa-1a7e4a5f4e95']",A co-location pattern-mining algorithm with a density-weighted distance thresholding consideration,Information Sciences,2017
609,"Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that integrates the Internet and physical objects belonging to different domains such as home automation, industrial process, human health and environmental monitoring. It deepens the presence of Internet-connected devices in our daily activities, bringing, in addition to many benefits, challenges related to security issues. For more than two decades, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been an important tool for the protection of networks and information systems. However, applying traditional IDS techniques to IoT is difficult due to its particular characteristics such as constrained-resource devices, specific protocol stacks, and standards. In this paper, we present a survey of IDS research efforts for IoT. Our objective is to identify leading trends, open issues, and future research possibilities. We classified the IDSs proposed in the literature according to the following attributes: detection method, IDS placement strategy, security threat and validation strategy. We also discussed the different possibilities for each attribute, detailing aspects of works that either propose specific IDS schemes for IoT or develop attack detection strategies for IoT threats that might be embedded in IDSs.","['Bruno Bogaz Zarpelão', 'Rodrigo Sanches Miani', 'Cláudio Toshio Kawakani', 'Sean Carlisto de Alvarenga']",43d35160-1aa6-4077-92ad-4e3e736f1369,0,"['049f6708-daf8-4284-98a6-9535c9d6e67e', '0766384f-3e0f-45ca-8e6a-bbe63b31679a', '0e2c6353-5775-4537-8c22-24a8f3266c0c', '0ed3ae9a-c994-4296-b0e5-12f74939b68c', '10891302-1c4f-4be0-a051-27fc30894b44', '12a338ed-522a-4915-9e52-2d6a69bef9e4', '12c8042e-46cf-4d78-b7af-c2f00cfc5542', '18c63586-b8ed-4ede-955e-3252a7fd8065', '1a9ebf9b-4969-4865-94c4-8ded35e60173', '1eec4f61-7302-4005-bbd2-ddab12a75d6d', '24f9fc97-cf1a-468c-a128-5ac8a9d6f104', '28571595-0965-49e9-b7f9-12d2df43a485', '28fa948e-8887-471b-9b79-8fc81bf96bd1', '2b221460-35a4-4d7f-bbcb-3937ca5340f7', '314c1b11-76f0-4d06-9c1b-1e9afd7aaf14', '47f46030-a298-4526-83c9-6d27cf361c64', '4e1d8d71-034f-41cd-9498-bc3c15130ba9', '4e4718ea-1600-4b01-b029-5dfe3be2031d', '5513cd6b-8f96-492b-8754-85ca7f3fa60c', '57333c29-19a5-4702-a39b-12c1c3ee8fc0', '5d958023-8893-4e41-ad99-99f1410f9684', '62fa83b8-b757-4f54-86a5-bf271219f7e7', '636f8d8b-c8ca-42b5-9fd9-e73781a75823', '6ef48f2a-3a73-4609-89ac-765d7cac7414', '78a447a9-ac6c-4022-b734-af43a26de603', '7f31f082-073b-47e8-bb56-13f03e160c5f', '812b2e15-bf7d-4011-ad04-4933d4fbb531', '813c1a5d-e999-40b2-a46e-ec56cea27e3d', '83258e06-eace-42c2-80eb-60f55d06a1d9', '83f109f6-46b0-4274-8d0c-6198a8cce21a', '8d372af4-9bbd-499c-a00d-c6cfd91f6dfb', '90e84700-a03a-476a-beab-a5b626c8ac57', '94654cff-0514-4c8f-a631-09a859310773', 'a07ff3a4-018a-48db-b4c5-016b95fb2530', 'a689d748-1e04-4097-a15d-cdaae9d1ffdb', 'ae8450ef-0ab8-4d65-934a-a057b44903ab', 'b562bf98-9a5e-43b1-b3f3-4224275295f9', 'be4da967-55be-4e19-b609-5b078e6ec090', 'c143fece-78d4-44cd-b481-4629501c21a0', 'c4381f4e-bfe2-406d-8511-1674211f2fd4', 'c94bbbab-ad9b-41ca-a74b-03c2b0844a14', 'c95ac61c-64af-4467-ac15-49982811b58c', 'c9a0954f-fe0c-40ce-907a-13eac3f1b186', 'cd496fff-b429-4552-b47c-18eb93345712', 'd0fa14bd-bb96-4b22-b0c1-b73d3814b761', 'd78a776c-b58a-4ff0-a3e9-be0554cc93ce', 'd9bfc7b5-45b9-4eb3-9c8b-c8a56b0e5c3e', 'dc626991-3b23-413b-9eb6-ad67eebe09d4', 'dd6c5712-8b46-48a9-b9c4-3de3f268d81b', 'e0799397-700f-4c81-b3a3-082ffaa04084', 'e56971d4-dbcd-4e93-ac76-b4c4b4210300', 'e6ff518c-bde9-40d7-a7c3-209f6612ec16', 'eff44ead-c7d1-4ed4-933a-fd2f463d947d', 'f06ae855-da58-4fa6-9c1c-863e6f1be1f2']",A survey of intrusion detection in Internet of Things,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017
610,"With advances in reverse vaccinology approaches, a progressive improvement has been observed in the prediction of putative vaccine candidates. Reverse vaccinology has changed the way of discovery and provides a mean to propose target identification in reduced time and labour. In this regard, high throughput genomic sequencing technologies and supporting bioinformatics tools have greatly facilitated the prompt analysis of pathogens, where various predicted candidates have been found effective against certain infections and diseases. A pipeline, VacSol, is designed here based on a similar approach to predict putative vaccine candidates both rapidly and efficiently. VacSol, a new pipeline introduced here, is a highly scalable, multi-mode, and configurable software designed to automate the high throughput in silico vaccine candidate prediction process for the identification of putative vaccine candidates against the proteome of bacterial pathogens. Vaccine candidates are screened using integrated, well-known and robust algorithms/tools for proteome analysis, and the results from the VacSol software are presented in five different formats by taking proteome sequence as input in FASTA file format. The utility of VacSol is tested and compared with published data and using the Helicobacter pylori 26695 reference strain as a benchmark. VacSol rapidly and efficiently screens the whole bacterial pathogen proteome to identify a few predicted putative vaccine candidate proteins. This pipeline has the potential to save computational costs and time by efficiently reducing false positive candidate hits. VacSol results do not depend on any universal set of rules and may vary based on the provided input.

611,"This paper presents contrast enhancement algorithms based on fuzzy contextual information of the images. We introduce fuzzy similarity index and fuzzy contrast factor to capture the neighborhood characteristics of a pixel. A new histogram, using fuzzy contrast factor of each pixel is developed, and termed the fuzzy dissimilarity histogram (FDH). A cumulative distribution function is formed with normalized values of an FDH and used as a transfer function to obtain the contrast enhanced image. The algorithm gives good contrast enhancement and preserves the natural characteristic of the image. In order to develop a contextual intensity transfer function, we introduce a fuzzy membership function based on fuzzy similarity index and coefficient of variation of the image. The contextual intensity transfer function is designed using the fuzzy membership function to achieve final contrast enhanced image. The overall algorithm is referred as the fuzzy contextual contrast-enhancement algorithm. The proposed algorithms are compared with the conventional and the state-of-the-art contrast enhancement algorithms. The quantitative and visual assessment of the results is performed. The results of quantitative measures are statistically analyzed using t-test. The exhaustive experimentation and analysis show the proposed algorithm efficiently enhances contrast and yields in natural visual quality images.","['Anil Singh Parihar', 'Om Prakash Verma', 'Chintan Khanna']",e9ea3a70-8153-4da5-a6b8-9259f99250ca,0,"['136c5afa-5802-4292-93ef-a975663a18dc', '14a80658-0561-4159-9dbf-182f9fd4f945', '15553b53-c234-4482-9ebc-c298cacbc335', '2a9cc45c-3eb3-49c2-a340-ecf50da8256e', '2e710388-c7cc-4125-ae59-459f8a599cc0', '309f11f3-0575-4787-9f2d-d3888c5db5b1', '4e30df77-54d8-461d-a93f-efcdffd9d244', '5c946b47-e44e-4cff-94df-4db20e2a5a80', '64979548-896e-4c92-b374-05808d032dfd', '66f75776-c7dd-4076-88f9-c3658d8934d8', '678e5eb1-a3b2-4903-82f2-5b0e9b631056', '80e92205-61c1-4a7c-a667-0313eb91409b', '9368c7ea-e810-41d2-b9e1-3d97d2f1578e', 'a680f695-8d53-4a29-8378-3a2631bd67df', 'ab44730f-f708-4be9-bfed-d585d23222d9', 'ac8da121-6c6f-4560-9440-13a17b8430f5', 'b3474bef-2248-4743-b71f-9e09114063b7', 'b5da632a-cb4a-4e2e-ae11-f2f3cffed6f9', 'b71fcea7-880b-4dc3-90aa-b7a7f725001c', 'fcd32ec7-8a0f-41bc-bcc2-417edc8cbc96']",Fuzzy-Contextual Contrast Enhancement,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
612,"This paper explores polynomial optimization techniques for two formulations of the energy conservation constraint for the valve setting problem in water networks. The sparse hierarchy of semidefinite programing relaxations is used to derive globally optimal bounds for an existing cubic and a new quadratic problem formulation. Both formulations use an approximation for friction loss that has an accuracy consistent with the experimental error of the classical equations. Solutions using the proposed approach are reported on four water networks ranging in size from 4 to 2000 nodes and are compared against a local solver, Ipopt and a global solver, Couenne. Computational results found global solutions using both formulations with the quadratic formulation having better time efficiency due to the reduced degree of the polynomial optimization problem and the sparsity of the constraint matrix. The approaches presented in this paper may also allow global solutions to other water network steady-state optimization problems formulated with continuous variables.","['Bissan Ghaddar', 'Mathieu Claeys', 'Martin Mevissen', 'Bradley J.

613,"Bundle protocol (BP) is the main protocol of delay/disruption-tolerant networking which is developed to provide reliable data delivery services in a stressed communications environment. A typical application of BP is for data delivery in a challenging deep-space communication environment. However, little work has been done in analyzing the performance of BP in deep-space communications, especially in presence of highly channel-rate asymmetry. In this paper, we present analytical modeling of the transmission performance of BP over deep-space communication channels characterized by highly asymmetric channel rates. The model is built to estimate the expected file delivery time (and goodput) of the protocol for reliable data delivery in a deep-space transmission scenario. The model is validated by conducting data transfer experiments using a PC-based experimental test bed.","['Alaa Sabbagh', 'Ruhai Wang', 'Kanglian Zhao', 'Dongming Bian']",60c72c43-e8cb-4a85-a021-2ef240534dfa,0,"['14a20dcc-f4c4-4308-bfb2-e90237ffa8bc', '15216010-16a7-4fd9-b316-a1d72301c4d6', '51562e39-ad44-4f16-ba60-62a308e22383', '62b00b7d-09de-4243-bab3-4589cd1f2f65', '701db771-4ced-4e5d-aa32-a9fc814ef41f', '74116139-086c-4dbc-9934-7defdf7c21d1', '75a2924d-e378-48ce-877e-c1d04a0fb3bf', '77cf9614-e90b-4dcd-b64b-4c2935c426a8', '9b717c1d-2d72-4ce9-9718-f1f6ba563bb0', 'b95070ea-5c39-4e93-ac05-533368079177', 'cefb7fa4-a5ff-43fb-92dc-b9973e4b3cc0', 'd24fe5ab-d8ca-4747-bb75-9360dfbab209', 'e60d19c3-ff49-4b71-95f9-7f674cd3eb6a', 'f3b431ca-f4a3-4e84-9af9-ff1dfea8a17b', 'f7e8833f-324c-4700-8b9a-2c1cfc210fb5', 'ff65451d-aa95-4e1c-864a-f0ba8f708897']",Bundle Protocol Over Highly Asymmetric Deep-Space Channels,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2017

Then, we describe incremental algorithms for constructing the probabilistic conflict, neutral, and allied sets in dynamic information systems, and their effectiveness is illustrated by experimental results.

615,"ABSTRACTThis paper is concerned with the design of a high-order repetitive control (RC) law for a class of discrete-time linear switched systems with repetition-varying reference trajectories. First, a high-order RC law, which embeds the characteristic of known variation of the reference trajectories, is proposed to the system, and a two-dimensional (2D) model is presented to describe the control and learning actions of the repetitive control system by using the lifting technique. By choosing appropriate multiple Lyapunov–Krasovskii functions, sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of the 2D system are derived in the form of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.","['Zhen Shao', 'Zhengrong Xiang']",37341c1b-f7a4-43c6-8329-ad33a6162fc2,0,"['08d746ab-4878-46a1-a5c9-a89769d853dd', '30881a72-2835-44d5-b1bb-2b7f5978ce80', '33c93126-576a-46cd-ab14-8a49208d4691', '3a7fad6f-213f-457b-aac2-cb89cb8df084', '4661dc44-ee24-4b04-8953-9aafe3eb5259', '507f03ba-14fc-4ef8-86cc-698b866da70d', '515ceded-bdbd-4f35-92c3-e66f58666cd5', '62ab545d-d197-46f8-b43a-ecc527e7c541', '6ba508d3-6280-437c-a598-dd06acf0f012', '6cfeda73-d8d9-4a89-885c-af9fe11d8b2f', '6f9901c9-455d-4eed-87b0-9f5890a1a417', '93135584-ab8f-4f79-b842-063b6589cbaa', 'c0cca070-a100-4104-8717-b9c0c2246353', 'c773c727-f512-4fad-9ada-bc07d2d8c2a5', 'd0519ebd-61d1-46c5-87f0-bbb0953b9365', 'eb6c1205-d6dc-49e9-a805-c21fcdce3bab']",High-order repetitive control for discrete-time linear switched systems,International Journal of Systems Science,2017

The Australian SedNet model represents a middle ground between process-based and empirical models and is being modified for New Zealand conditions by incorporating shallow landsliding.#R##N##R##N#We describe a method for implementing a model within SedNetNZ to provide the long-term annual average sediment contribution from shallow landsliding and its spatial distribution. The mass of soil eroded over a defined period is calculated from the landslide probability for each slope class, slope class area, failure depth, soil bulk density, and sediment delivery ratio. Landslide probability is derived from mapping a time series of landslides intersected with DEM-derived slope. The conceptual approach and methodology for parameterisation are suitable for landslide modelling where rainfall-triggered shallow landslides occur.","['Harley D. Betts', 'L. R. Basher', 'John R.

617,"Abstract   The tree-metric theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a dissimilarity matrix to be a tree metric, and has served as the foundation for numerous distance-based reconstruction methods in phylogenetics. Our main result is an extension of the tree-metric theorem to more general dissimilarity maps. In particular, we show that a tree with  n  leaves is reconstructible from the weights of the  m -leaf subtrees provided that  n  ≥ 2 m  — 1.","['Lior Pachter', 'David E Speyer']",94165c07-5d81-418e-912a-8f3302c1c8a8,69,"['0270a584-f399-4db0-82a6-5cf6dfc2a310', '92198643-75b6-4520-ac4f-225904f6371f']",Reconstructing trees from subtree weights,Applied Mathematics Letters,2004
618,"Low-cost radio-frequency identification tags are confronted with various security and privacy issues due to their limits in computational and storage capabilities. Many lightweight authentication protocols have been proposed so far to resist all possible attacks and threats. A revised Tree-LSHB+ protocol was recently proposed by Qian et al. [Wirel Pers Commun 77(4):3125–3141. doi:10.1007/s11277-014-1699-x, 2014] after a security analysis on the original Tree-LSHB+ protocol proposed by Deng et al.

In this paper, we present an active attack against it in a general man-in-the-middle attack where an adversary is capable of eavesdropping, intercepting, manipulating, and blocking the messages transmitted between a legitimate reader and a legitimate tag. The attack is proved to be efficient to disclose all the authentication keys shared between a reader and a tag. Additionally, we introduce another possible active attack which can even retrieve all the secrets in the tree-traversal stage.","['M.

619,"Visualization of literature-related information is common in scientometrics and related fields. Despite this, relatively little work has been done to visualize knowledge organization systems, such as controlled vocabularies or thesauri. In this paper we explore the creation and use of contextual visualizations based on thesauri. Two different methods are developed for creating maps of thesaurus terms that can then be used as templates or basemaps on which to display the contents of publication sets. The first example maps first-level terms from the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus into a wheel-like (hub and spokes) configuration. This circular map can then be used to show relative positions of clusters of astronomy papers from different cluster solutions based on the thesaurus terms assigned to the papers in the clusters. The second example triangulates the entire Public Library of Science (PLOS) thesaurus onto a global map of science, and then uses the resulting map of thesaurus terms as the basis for an overlay map. This map can be used for several purposes, including mapping of subsets of PLOS content, and the identification of thesaurus terms whose rule bases may need to be changed.",['Kevin W.

620,"In the context of the growth slowdown in China, it is important to accurately forecast the future economic trend to guide policy-makers the direction of adjusting their current economic policies. In this paper, we intend to predict Beijing's tertiary industry, whose datasets are small, irregular and non-stationary, leading to a difficulty of building an accurate prediction model. To this end, we present an improved grey model, named PRGM(1,1), which extends the grey prediction model by integrating two techniques, i.e., the particle swarm optimization algorithm for parameter optimization and the exponential preprocessing method for data cleaning. The experimental results show that PRGM(1,1) outperforms other variants of the grey prediction model in predicting Beijing's tertiary industry, and is viable to do reasonable prediction over short and fluctuated economic data sequences. In addition, we employ PRGM(1,1) in the economic prediction of Beijing's tertiary industry in the next five years, and conclude that the growth rate will decelerate. Our prediction result seems to be in line with the economic slowdown in China this year.","['Qianru Wang', 'Li Liu', 'Shu Wang', 'Jianzhou Wang', 'Ming Liu']",3bf097d4-c879-4cb6-ab55-e4f045ec5bc8,0,"['022541d5-1643-4944-ad21-33bc663882b8', '039ee267-feb4-45f5-8baa-e4d7d15b0ccf', '10409393-e904-4cdc-8cca-173681e477d2', '2ab7414f-4327-4539-902c-6be86947d1fb', '47bd9dd1-c2e5-4093-bc4b-dac9f44ef27e', '8bf054a6-76c2-476a-8214-a669940400fd', 'b00ae4a1-19d4-4d10-89fa-fc36fe6bfe92', 'f59b0361-892d-4f4e-9005-7acb5020c8da']",Predicting Beijing's tertiary industry with an improved grey model,Applied Soft Computing,2017
621,"Suggesting novel compounds to be made on the basis of similarity to a previously seen structure–activity relationship (SAR) requires a measure for SAR similarity. While SAR similarity has intuitively been used by medicinal chemists for decades, no systematic comparison of candidate similarity metrics has been published to date. With this publication, we attempt to close that gap by providing a statistical framework that allows comparison of SAR similarity metrics by their ability to rank series that provide the best activity prediction of novel substituents. This prediction is a result of a two-step process that involves (a) judging the similarity between series and (b) transferring the SAR from one series to the other. We tested several SAR similarity metrics and found that a centered RMSD (cRMSD) in combination with a lineaar-regression-based prediction interpolation ranks SAR profiles best. Based on that ranking we can, with a given confidence, suggest novel substituents to be tested. The superiority o...","['Emanuel S. R.

623,"Automation of the execution of computational tasks is at the heart of improving scientific productivity. Over the last years, scientific workflows have been established as an important abstraction that captures data processing and computation of large and complex scientific applications. By allowing scientists to model and express entire data processing steps and their dependencies, workflow management systems relieve scientists from the details of an application and manage its execution on a computational infrastructure. As the resource requirements of today’s computational and data science applications that process vast amounts of data keep increasing, there is a compelling case for a new generation of advances in high-performance computing, commonly termed as extreme-scale computing, which will bring forth multiple challenges for the design of workflow applications and management systems. This paper presents a novel characterization of workflow management systems using features commonly associated with extreme-scale computing applications. We classify 15 popular workflow management systems in terms of workflow execution models, heterogeneous computing environments, and data access methods. The paper also surveys workflow applications and identifies gaps for future research on the road to extreme-scale workflows and management systems.","['Rafael Ferreira da Silva', 'Rosa Filgueira', 'Ilia Pietri', 'Ming Jiang', 'Rizos Sakellariou', 'Ewa Deelman']",027f82ec-e493-40bb-9ef4-6fe02e0240b4,0,"['0153d0d9-39b7-41c9-9f21-b948a71320c8', '05e3cce5-9f61-4629-8379-b57956193a33', '14a89fb0-acf1-47d5-84bf-a4330c0f9829', '15d90928-ec43-49eb-bb4e-5be67866730b', '1a1f781c-6d86-448d-9d33-b8308b0f3344', '1eb428e2-037b-4c89-933d-0822f86adc89', '1f0b5450-c574-4c50-9d42-23fc8888db4b', '1f65fd3b-d793-4f62-9226-11d459cded77', '1f830777-ade3-43c6-a6b7-599955fa7c8c', '2cf94f5a-9b6b-4475-baeb-25ba86e3ed20', '2df98ccf-bd03-4b88-8652-e599ff037829', '2fb5e0c9-46b7-4352-aac5-26e3c37f5430', '3c25cac6-72be-4175-b909-8c6d540323e2', '42ae541f-c35b-4114-bf5f-dfc2ff993f40', '4581945d-845f-4081-a07d-24007a7308fc', '4878b54f-fbf1-4ec6-a26c-58ceb9d59dff', '4b25ec25-e04e-446b-a0d8-058581335cad', '4c78b6b2-80f7-4bcd-9426-b8a6fb4eff90', '509625c3-0fcd-44fe-aaa9-5726ae9bb09c', '5d221d7c-fe0c-4b15-96be-da8448a0b849', '5de27a29-aa04-47ac-944b-0b1b792197a7', '5df2c9b7-d7b6-4b22-b10a-aca63b96ae6c', '60c97ea5-caa2-4a23-95fd-6aa74cf9ccc3', '631f6315-eed2-4944-b58d-025cb31c1ee2', '63377bf0-0fa5-4af1-a426-adea3000c8ef', '7851b525-3356-4de8-aee9-01bb0985c943', '7c756d12-17d9-4896-a728-26bf3ee4e768', '7db2b197-8e01-4f45-b354-4a9aa5d3cb61', '7e99e3b1-c1e5-4230-aa59-2bc7b8741e09', '7f7fc265-785c-491c-b90f-f037a88f32ff', '80e23e30-826b-478e-a002-826781bb78a3', '88ae1748-f97b-494f-9bd1-910f5dc1fc48', '8c616a38-283b-4a98-9966-9c6574b8af53', '8d6466ce-65d0-4ccf-80f3-e9e8e9b4c383', '91bd5bed-21b6-4344-a446-917b483f5827', '9301ef29-0759-4c2b-a2b3-5bd2b90630f6', '94c15805-ea4d-483c-b6c4-46571adc00a6', '9793952f-8417-4caf-bf9f-d3c412b2f252', '9ad49e32-222b-4b6f-b396-fc0e95dc9730', '9cae3345-7ee3-4a48-ba73-a52e99dcff8c', 'a11fa10c-0a3f-43a4-9ad6-782c094f2c6b', 'a17cb13f-c869-42f1-a612-76d09e30c7ee', 'b0554ea8-da7d-4203-be8e-27f8a75a95dd', 'b6650996-c706-4a0a-b05b-a6546cce4c74', 'c4a47248-6f9f-4cb3-b2a9-0a866910388c', 'c880bce2-001a-4cbb-a34c-dff6fe4fedaf', 'dd19d498-b7c4-4173-8466-883d8cbecf9a', 'dfc7bfc6-9b05-4974-92c1-578d3f0ecb44', 'e3e10e0f-04d9-40b9-9e88-28be1a89aff1', 'e9b1a127-5201-4f75-a410-d78a307f3cb8', 'f1fcee01-0d20-4a1e-af8d-92002d10108f', 'fb0a382c-a1f1-4f0c-8e80-36fe5fbbfb86']",A characterization of workflow management systems for extreme-scale applications,Future Generation Computer Systems,2017

The answer to this question is important, since some published numerical studies use the time DQs, whereas other numerical studies do not. The criterion used in this paper to answer this question is the optimality of the convergence rate of the error of the reduced order model with respect to the number of POD basis functions. Since to the best of our knowledge a definition of the optimality of the convergence rate is not available, we propose one in Definition 3.1 in this paper. Two cases are considered: the no_DQ case, in which the snapshot DQs are not used, and the DQ case, in which the snapshot DQs are used.

626,"Tremendous traffic on the Internet exhibits ON/OFF patterns. In the past, the generation of such ON/OFF traffic was mainly attributed to TCP and application characteristics. Nowadays, however, much traffic is often intentionally shaped into an ON/OFF pattern for achieving certain optimized system performance or resulting from characteristics of some new applications. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on the ON/OFF traffic shaping in the current Internet. We first introduce the motivations behind ON/OFF traffic shaping in different fields based on different system optimization objectives and application characteristics. We then introduce the impacts of ON/OFF traffic on packet drop probability, real-time applications, and also its interaction with TCP's congestion control mechanism. We further present a survey on existing mechanisms for mitigating these impacts in various aspects. We introduce how each of these mechanisms works, and discuss their merits and deficiencies. Finally, we conclude this article with some future directions for ON/OFF traffic shaping in the Internet.","['Yongxiang Zhao', 'Baoxian Zhang', 'Cheng Li', 'Changjia Chen']",7f14f0a8-6e9b-4259-a753-0057bd302abe,0,"['0d9bdc70-9224-43b9-8968-a1b795fd75e2', '4920525c-7ad6-4ed5-b504-6c4e1e7dbb4d', '67fb7c8d-79f0-474a-ace8-b7b3ec26bd82', '760618b3-4331-425a-9232-b809d3f20b44', '8339ac27-c60b-456d-9ed9-f383c5b80cdf', 'a2344484-8601-4f7d-912e-2273a45c3dff', 'b232116c-0844-4ef1-818e-2348dde7b8c9', 'b718ec45-c2cf-44f7-9841-1a1cace98d57', 'bd64b16f-9a06-4202-a8c6-0243de4c6d71', 'c31a5981-05c1-4866-891b-f0a6b9f7ea58', 'c9e66649-559e-4dc8-bbff-b6c4c2385cfd', 'cac0e3d3-7f05-484b-b07f-5f4e57142b03', 'e11a962e-b72c-45f1-b217-7f19e0fd16c7', 'e24c78c7-5676-468f-b899-73d10fb517d0']","ON/OFF Traffic Shaping in the Internet: Motivation, Challenges, and Solutions",IEEE Network,2017
627,"In software-defined networks (SDN), most controllers do not have an established control function for endpoint users and access terminals to access network, which may lead to many attacks. In order to address the problem of security check on access terminals, a secure trusted access method in SDN is designed and implemented in this paper. The method includes an access architecture design and a security access authentication protocol. The access architecture combines the characteristics of the trusted access technology and SDN architecture, and enhances the access security of SDN. The security access authentication protocol specifies the specific structure and implementation of data exchange in the access process. The architecture and protocol implemented in this paper can complete the credibility judgment of the access device and user's identification. Furthermore, it provides different trusted users with different network access permissions. Experiments show that the proposed access method is more secure than the access method that is based on IP address, MAC address and user identity authentication only, thus can effectively guarantee the access security of SDN.","['Jing Liu', 'Yingxu Lai', 'Zipeng Diao', 'Yinong Chen']",9a94da7f-8f2a-41c5-b736-2b3916ab7fae,0,"['0f06676c-cbd6-4ca2-88e3-b3859ba07837', '191f6145-0932-444c-83f0-9ed359b0f614', '3d793899-7f30-43d5-a3de-a07655fbf3a2', '47aa4308-d1f9-4a7d-aaea-56302f430fce', '49853b10-b217-4d19-9a9b-61244ce873ba', '804cb992-d1ab-4d00-a6d4-db8f089f1c69', 'b276f063-d3d7-4489-8ce9-2b03aa7f88e2', 'cc02628a-6e09-444c-858e-d8e883250fdb']",A trusted access method in software-defined network,Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory,2017
628,"Purpose#R##N#There is no standard for measuring maximal diameter (Dmax) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from computer tomography (CT) images although differences between Dmax evaluated from transversal (axialDmax) or orthogonal (orthoDmax) planes can be large especially for angulated AAAs. Therefore we investigated their correlations with alternative rupture risk indicators as peak wall stress (PWS) and peak wall rupture risk (PWRR) to decide which Dmax is more relevant in AAA rupture risk assessment.#R##N#Material and methods#R##N#The Dmax values were measured by a trained radiologist from 70 collected CT scans, and the corresponding PWS and PWRR were evaluated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The cohort was ordered according to the difference between axialDmax and orthoDmax (Da−oDa−o) quantifying the aneurysm angulation, and Spearman's correlation coefficients between PWS/PWRR – orthoDmax/axialDmax were calculated.#R##N#Results#R##N#The calculated correlations PWS/PWRR vs. orthoDmax were substantially higher for angulated AAAs (with Da−o≥3mmDa−o≥3mm). Under this limit, the correlations were almost the same for both Dmax values. Analysis of AAAs divided into two groups of angulated (n=38) and straight (n=32) cases revealed that both groups are similar in all parameters (orthoDmax, PWS, PWRR) with the exception of axialDmax (p=0.024).#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#It was confirmed that orthoDmax is better correlated with the alternative rupture risk predictors PWS and PWRR for angulated AAAs (DA−O≥3mmDA−O≥3mm) while there is no difference between orthoDmax and axialDmax for straight AAAs (DA−O<3mmDA−O<3mm). As angulated AAAs represent a significant portion of cases it can be recommended to use orthoDmax as the only Dmax parameter for AAA rupture risk assessment.","['Kamil Novák', 'Stanislav Polzer', 'Tomas Krivka', 'Robert Vlachovsky', 'Robert Staffa', 'Luboš Kubíček', 'Lukas Lambert', 'J.

629,"Abstract  Clinical trials are typically conducted over a population within a defined time period in order to illuminate certain characteristics of a health issue or disease process. Cross-sectional studies provide a snapshot of these disease processes over a large number of people but do not allow us to model the temporal nature of disease, which is essential for modelling detailed prognostic predictions. Longitudinal studies, on the other hand, are used to explore how these processes develop over time in a number of people but can be expensive and time-consuming, and many studies only cover a relatively small window within the disease process. This paper explores the application of intelligent data analysis techniques for building reliable models of disease progression from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The aim is to learn disease ‘trajectories' from cross-sectional data by building realistic trajectories from healthy patients to those with advanced disease. We focus on exploring whether we can ‘calibrate' models learnt from these trajectories with real longitudinal data using Baum–Welch re-estimation so that the dynamic parameters reflect the true underlying processes more closely. We use Kullback–Leibler distance and Wilcoxon rank metrics to assess how calibration improves the models to better reflect the underlying dynamics.","['Allan Tucker', 'Yuanxi Li', 'David F.

630,"This paper studies how service providers can design social interaction among participants and quantify the causal impact of that interaction on service quality. We focus on education and analyze whether encouraging social interaction among students improves learning outcomes in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which are a new service delivery channel with universal access at reduced, if not zero, cost.We analyze three randomized experiments in a MOOC with more than 30, 317 students from 183 countries. Two experiments study large-group interaction by encouraging a random subset of students to visit the course discussion board. The majority of students treated in these experiments had higher social engagement, higher quiz completion rates, and higher course grades. Using these treatments as instrumental variables, we estimate that one additional board visit causally increases the probability that a student finishes the quiz in the subsequent week by up to 4.3%. The third experiment studies small-group interaction by encouraging a random subset of students to conduct one-on-one synchronous discussions. Students who followed through and actually conducted pairwise discussions increased their quiz completion rates and quiz scores by 10% in the subsequent week. Combining results from these three experiments, we provide recommendations for designing social interaction mechanisms to improve service quality","['Dennis J. Zhang', 'Gad Allon', 'Jan A.

631,"In the context of smart buildings, house energy consumption plays a significant role in the energy system. Since there are different billing rates, the aim of the smart grid system is to minimize the overall energy cost by appropriately selecting the best starting times for each household appliance. Further, the scheduler should guarantee that the instant energy request does not overcome the maximum threshold which depends on the customers contract.#R##N##R##N#Although the maximum threshold is a constant, the instant energy consumption may possibly exceed this value, whenever is available some renewable source such as, for instance, solar energy. In this work, we consider the problem of scheduling smart home appliances within a given time horizon respecting the threshold on the energy peak consumption with the objective of minimizing the overall cost related to the average energy consumption of each appliance at each time instant. A hybrid heuristic based on a mixed integer programming formulation of the problem and a particle swarm optimization approach are proposed. Computational results, applying these approaches to real life data are provided and discussed.","['Federico Della Croce', 'Michele Garraffa', 'Fabio Guido Mario Salassa', 'Claudio Borean', 'Giuseppe Di Bella', 'Ennio Grasso']",87096259-b34a-4918-8db2-41fa7111c00f,0,"['14411899-ca80-4380-b8d9-0d1c5bc89d2c', '1bf7d37c-f217-41b5-80f6-e6d9ec629ac0', '2c778db5-6630-470c-bcd8-01a765717652', '397c89d9-a223-436b-b171-f950ed55a62a', '42db0d04-d991-4b49-8c1b-053484b52023', '49237141-e969-4737-aae0-2236c753e3b3', '6e682d01-85a3-481c-834a-80b53ee2424d', '76b3b4a0-0c2a-46fa-9e04-f0e1307db2af', '8ff4858c-85d9-438d-ab1e-8d5eef5e070c', '97ae401a-26c7-4bd3-9a1a-e20686cf1f0b', '9b0d4e68-baf5-42f5-a3e1-179ee3977ee1', 'abc11499-ed4b-49c1-bc33-bfde7eaecd32', 'c3f7b225-71c1-4e9f-ada0-72ffdafdeeb3', 'dbdee23e-dcef-410d-b69a-0953da0f6bd5']",Heuristic approaches for a domestic energy management system,Computers & Industrial Engineering,2017
632,"Transfer learning has been proven to be effective for the problems where training data from a source domain and test data from a target domain are drawn from different distributions. To reduce the distribution divergence between the source domain and the target domain, many previous studies have been focused on designing and optimizing objective functions with the Euclidean distance to measure dissimilarity between instances. However, in some real-world applications, the Euclidean distance may be inappropriate to capture the intrinsic similarity or dissimilarity between instances. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a metric transfer learning framework (MTLF) to encode metric learning in transfer learning. In MTLF, instance weights are learned and exploited to bridge the distributions of different domains, while Mahalanobis distance is learned simultaneously to maximize the intra-class distances and minimize the inter-class distances for the target domain. Unlike previous work where instance weights and Mahalanobis distance are trained in a pipelined framework that potentially leads to error propagation across different components, MTLF attempts to learn instance weights and a Mahalanobis distance in a parallel framework to make knowledge transfer across domains more effective. Furthermore, we develop general solutions to both classification and regression problems on top of MTLF, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets on object recognition, handwriting recognition, and WiFi location to verify the effectiveness of MTLF compared with a number of state-of-the-art methods.","['Yonghui Xu', 'Sinno Jialin Pan', 'Hui Xiong', 'Qingyao Wu', 'Ronghua Luo', 'Huaqing Min', 'Hengjie Song']",5dd69cc5-57f9-4604-98b4-978ef9ca2404,0,"['0484b15e-ac40-47f1-9222-9f614c7302e6', '10ef7e12-fa90-42d2-800a-a1017c8d3900', '1b933d7c-5ad2-4875-9b19-74cc38747f67', '1c0f0053-1ec8-4ae2-9375-b515e4a61c4c', '1f96fea0-fca5-47e2-8deb-006770ec6b92', '2012cd0f-9806-4f22-a8b7-6cb68082a83f', '27138e4f-a3f9-435a-953f-dfad197027b3', '30ef957b-5455-4c00-856a-dd79624f89df', '36e0c7f2-26de-4b71-b5a3-3e06d3986be7', '38601d09-f56b-4a4a-ba08-b63fdd714cb0', '3d578e24-d4bc-4ccb-863d-e371c207d20e', '41b7180d-ebc7-40e9-9e29-960110af34cd', '54d4c20d-caa7-4bc9-9bbc-1731ea5ae264', '57f6b1f8-82f2-4072-bcae-5898c776e78e', '57fdc586-789d-4b38-94bd-3aad9259d1b7', '5aee6db3-7c39-4721-89f3-3a8c637b9d2f', '65032318-c010-475f-8cdd-67d50549456f', '65364f4c-f4f6-412a-8303-88386ece5121', '7b970453-2e8e-48b6-9469-1495d34f4d8f', '8375c581-f9bc-439f-991a-ca0164394154', '87f6b277-a7c0-4010-8852-395237281f9c', '94cf8509-1ef0-4a89-8ddb-ecc02b40a363', '9e9373eb-decd-4bfa-a31d-d9e8ed19e8f2', 'a2570f9a-e377-4d66-accf-72ebf46bf3f1', 'a955159c-3d20-4b43-abcb-0411ed1a5c02', 'b3cdf81a-65a2-458a-ac40-ac598a1729eb', 'bf2fc20c-191b-44c5-96d4-7fd9dc647f52', 'c0c6f8d0-ca71-4813-a271-065926bb2662', 'caa096ea-7072-461c-add6-bd1395740fbb', 'cd0bf8eb-2e6c-4272-ac4f-be26bcb40092', 'd0a24b88-3a63-4cf1-bb51-8161643082af', 'd9e00dd3-a08d-42ff-8b73-e60a26b9d348', 'e077afdb-f2cc-40f9-9869-174e33981374', 'e1f560b7-5852-4b4d-b04a-b9a5da00a994', 'e9f5e156-5766-4494-ae9a-33ffbc4ef53b', 'f6f6b46e-17f7-4dfe-9ef3-b20503b5464d', 'fce5c51f-3b1f-4a3f-869d-5bd95b73a82e']",A Unified Framework for Metric Transfer Learning,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017
633,"Channel state information at the transmitter side is an important issue for wireless communications systems, namely when precoding techniques are employed. Recent works explored random vector quantization (RVQ) as a solution for limited feedback for multi-user systems equipped with multiple antennas. Despite of being a good option for narrowband channels, this method requires large complexity and is not efficient for sparse channels. To overcome these drawbacks we consider a strategy based on uniform quantization, denoted partial uniform quantization (P-UQ), where just part of channel frequency response is quantized. This allows an efficient feedback of channel frequency response from the receivers to the transmitter, by using a reduced number of quantization bits. The comparison between the proposed P-UQ-based method and RVQ performed in this paper leads to the conclusion that the most advantageous method for sparse channels is the P-UQ.","['Sara Teodoro', 'Adão Silva', 'Rui Dinis', 'Atílio Gameiro']",516f20a6-29ef-4e40-8f34-d6de88890485,0,"['045b9b97-b59f-4fe2-9aac-48b2c369d823', '13723142-bc71-40b9-bcff-0f0032d73add', '3231f63a-ea0c-47c4-963a-d4488b24d685', '3b02234e-0326-454b-a7db-fe6a88f30958', '3d98b4b5-90e4-4ce0-a6f1-8b4e66e41053', '4296a611-0cd3-4c26-9229-22b591d59028', '52f5a00b-8598-4316-9694-2bf44fe65a60', '547521dd-57a0-40a9-9ceb-749e999ea265', '6857e70a-4967-4243-9060-0306a6190c9c', '6a9be9b9-b0fc-437c-a71d-32c27d6fa20e', '6b791ae7-224a-4665-a99d-ec1c366a0afc', '748a2ab3-8b5f-4d0a-9e2d-af685089843a', '7511c668-a178-4bea-88fc-7df38e0208e8', '7f9371f5-99df-41fc-a5dd-9979e219f79c', '81f3c4bb-29d9-43b2-92ab-0d196070c5bc', '9070d842-78d4-42f7-af99-fd7f4a6e18cc', '98dc3c3d-6c6d-4c79-b333-e06f42ab591e', 'b642bc78-d7b8-4ee6-9b67-e5286017099d', 'b649d182-b573-4185-9174-55b9f89c0e2a', 'bb92e52e-640c-4062-a5b6-317cbe4a55d9', 'be6ee677-48fc-4700-a4c6-765e36b4435d', 'd425c1f0-805c-413a-b548-faf673da6374', 'd7d6caa7-c00f-4f58-bec7-a043c5ff3c70', 'dc00221e-92c4-4ee4-8a7b-666ab5fd28c5', 'dccbb787-4eb1-44c3-b502-d2714e220f65', 'fe98632a-3545-42a7-9d01-0ec1ee211585']",Efficient Uniform Channel Quantization of Sparse CIR for Downlink OFDM Systems,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
634,"In this paper, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is used to visualize corrective actions of failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). SOM is a popular unsupervised neural network model that aims to produce a low-dimensional map (typically a two-dimensional map) for visualizing high-dimensional data. With regards to FMEA, it is a popular methodology to identify potential failure modes for a product or a process, to assess the risk associated with those failure modes, also, to identify and carry out corrective actions to address the most serious concerns. Despite the popularity of FMEA in a wide range of industries, two well-known shortcomings are the complexity of the FMEA worksheet and its intricacy of use. To the best of our knowledge, the use of computation techniques for solving the aforementioned shortcomings is limited. The use of SOM in FMEA is new. In this paper, corrective actions in FMEA are described in their severity, occurrence and detect scores. SOM is then used as a visualization aid for FMEA users to see the relationship among corrective actions via a map. Color information from the SOM map is then included to the FMEA worksheet for better visualization. In addition, a Risk Priority Number Interval is used to allow corrective actions to be evaluated and ordered in groups. Such approach provides a quick and easily understandable framework to elucidate important information from a complex FMEA worksheet; therefore facilitating the decision-making tasks by FMEA users. The significance of this study is two-fold, viz., the use of SOM as an effective neural network learning paradigm to facilitate FMEA implementations, and the use of a computational visualization approach to tackle the two well-known shortcomings of FMEA.","['Wui Lee Chang', 'Lie Meng Pang', 'Kai Meng Tay']",71442e3e-341a-4537-958a-5b22b9402253,0,"['17d3f800-4797-48db-9c2f-74209dc2d7fd', '1fc38984-da93-44e5-9d28-c88c71befce6', '20bc1438-9e2d-4907-88c8-c38265a09164', '32c5cd23-bcfc-4c4b-89a3-b29e93b6042c', '5f32771f-97b6-420d-abd2-732ceb21f610', 'ecb191e6-bf45-43b0-a6b1-79355621f22b', 'f22f0c69-3f42-46dc-8cad-895f99fccdab', 'f3a2e08c-34dc-455b-bce5-e3cd9bfd9b33']",Application of self-organizing map to failure modes and effects analysis methodology,Neurocomputing,2017
635,"Changes in land use affect the terrestrial carbon stock through changes in the land cover. Research on land use and analysis of variations in carbon stock have practical applications in the optimization of land use and the mitigation of climate change effects. This study was conducted in Baixiang and Julu counties in the Taihang Piedmont by employing the trend analysis method to characterize the variation in county land use and carbon stock. The findings show that in both counties, agricultural and unused land areas decreased while built-up land area increased, and the reduction in cropland was the main reason behind the agricultural land reduction. An inflection point appeared on the cropland curves of Julu, because the cropland area decreased by 1576.97 hm\(^{2},\) from 2004 to 2006. Cropland area in Baixiang decreased from 1996 to 1998 by a total of 129.89 hm\(^{2},\) and then remained relatively stable after 1998. The total carbon storage and variation in land use in the two counties displayed similar trends.

636,"Abstract#R##N#Interatomic exchange-correlation energies correspond to the covalent energetic contributions to an interatomic interaction in real space theories of the chemical bond, but their widespread use is severely limited due to their computationally intensive character. In the same way as the multipolar (mp) expansion is customary used in biomolecular modeling to approximate the classical Coulomb interaction between two charge densities ρA(r) and ρB(r), we examine in this work the mp approach to approximate the interatomic exchange-correlation (xc) energies of the Interacting Quantum Atoms method. We show that the full xc mp series is quickly divergent for directly bonded atoms (1–2 pairs) albeit it works reasonably well most times for 1– n (n > 2) interactions. As with conventional perturbation theory, we show numerically that the xc series is asymptotically convergent and that, a truncated xc mp approximation retaining terms up to l1+l2=2 usually gives relatively accurate results, sometimes even for directly bonded atoms. Our findings are supported by extensive numerical analyses on a variety of systems that range from several standard hydrogen bonded dimers to typically covalent or aromatic molecules. The exact algebraic relationship between the monopole-monopole xc mp term and the inter-atomic bond order, as measured by the delocalization index of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, is also established. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['Evelio Francisco', 'Daniel Menéndez Crespo', 'Aurora Costales', 'Ángel Martín Pendás']",8e88c97c-410c-412e-85bf-e615bf54dff6,0,"['31163f5c-c161-4bb7-a440-3510b1d45041', '5caee132-174d-4e3f-8b6f-440936ad18fa', '84e9fafc-868a-4a63-9eaa-a644c8d1ff08']",A multipolar approach to the interatomic covalent interaction energy,Journal of Computational Chemistry,2017
637,"This paper presents a novel approach to learning of relations among motions, objects, and language, and to generating sentences that describe human actions. Our approach categorizes human motions and the objects acted on those motions, and subsequently integrates the motion categories and object categories with their descriptive sentences. The integration consists of two steps. The first step stochastically learns the relations among the motions, objects, and words in the sentences. The second step stochastically learns the order of words in the sentences as the sentence structures. The model derived in the first step is referred to as “action language” model and that derived in the second step as “natural language” model. This framework for integrating an action language model with a natural language model can be applied to generating descriptive sentences from human actions, where each action is recognized as a pair containing a motion category and an object category, the words relevant to the action are generated via the contained motion and object categories, and the words to be arranged result in a descriptive sentence. More theoretically, our approach searches for multiple words likely to be generated from the motion and object categories by using the action language model; and subsequently searches for a sequence of these words that is likely to be generated from the obtained words, using the natural language model. We tested our proposed approach for sentence generation by applying it to human action data captured by an RGB-D sensor, and demonstrated its validity.","['Wataru Takano', 'Yoshihiko Yamada', 'Yoshihiko Nakamura']",7aa9ef0a-9b7d-426f-8259-c82be747a086,0,"['076d42d7-8290-4382-a334-5e9c77f8d7d3', '110ff665-e4aa-4659-8c91-da572911f686', '1268112c-a3a5-411d-9469-c9937aed533e', '164525c5-f66f-4128-b913-4a2c5b028acb', '1846e33e-cb41-46f4-904d-9bbed8abf5fc', '1952ca1a-7c6b-44de-a603-03428dbcad45', '43b4aa28-fd1a-4be8-8cc0-e1c196494b2b', '45c38972-4dfa-4291-88b8-e2114a78e300', '4a11d0fd-d5e0-4c2e-8302-0ec82e11a3f1', '4b4c59f7-6cb0-477c-95c1-cf2c1e3f1822', '50dd56db-151d-4d62-8576-65f0ef6f381b', '522321c2-7c42-4a7d-9ba9-947988e424f8', '5e564353-6b49-4846-b65e-06b0b7f62a2b', '6018a516-8149-4bce-bc33-5449d86e58c2', '64dd7d1b-14fb-41a8-a451-4b10aa7102d2', '9c0a3986-8f4c-4ff4-a8c1-4a068c7e9217', '9f1c57c9-ae6c-4e00-b3ee-10256adb3cb1', '9f958ec9-f850-490a-958c-97e8d8dcbda8', 'a04f76d5-d951-4418-9156-24a2be00879b', 'a7a8373e-f99e-42f9-b5d1-718733650250', 'a86c8743-36d8-443a-956a-36f0d4bec8ef', 'ac5e3fe4-3b1d-412d-a03b-3247d39f62d5', 'ba2fcc5b-b581-4ae3-ad6c-1c0f5a2e5240', 'f1f1154c-1d52-446f-9382-160e3ed2f636', 'f64b4ead-83c4-41f2-9326-b3f9faed8106']",Generation of action description from classification of motion and object,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2017

One of the coordination systems is formed by the collaboration of aerial ad hoc network and ground ad hoc network that performs cognitive coordination to form an effective guidance system despite operating with different configurations and dynamics. For guidance system, unmanned aerial vehicles form a cognitive map and relay them effectively to the intended node which is a part of ground ad hoc unit. The data sharing is difficult between the networks operating under different circumstances and configurations. An efficient approach is required to provide low-complex relaying for faster communications in these coordinated networks. One of the solutions can be found from the fuzzy formation of the problem that can be applied to some optimization algorithms to efficiently select the cognitive corridors intended for enhanced transmission. In this paper, a fuzzy-based bee colony optimization algorithm is proposed which operates over cooperative trust value, cognitive relaying value and situational awareness to provide efficient cognitive relaying between the two ad hoc units, and uses a cloud server to provide coordination between the nodes.

640,"A cashback website (CW) is a type of reward website that pays its members a rebate when they purchase goods via affiliate links. The website receives a commission from an e-shop when a customer makes a purchase by following a link instead of visiting the e-shop directly. With the rapid rise in e-shops, CWs are becoming increasingly popular. However, these CWs’ value to e-shops is still somewhat unclear, in both theory and practice. To clarify the process, we consider a system in which an e-shop sells a product to consumers and a CW provides the link to the e-shop. Based on consumers’ utility, we develop a model to study the value of the CW to the e-shop in both centralized and decentralized settings, and demonstrate and compare the two parties’ optimal strategies and their corresponding profits in both settings. Our main findings are as follows: (1) The CW can always bring the e-shop more profits, whether the setting is centralized or decentralized, by playing the role of price discrimination. (2) In contrast to the centralized setting, the decentralized setting does not lead to a higher sales price; in many cases, it offers a lower sales price, which is opposite of the case typically seen in traditional supply chain literature. (3) Compared with the decentralized setting, the centralized setting does not allow all consumers to have more consumer surplus—which, again, differs from traditional supply chain literature—but rather yields more total profit to the system, which implies that it is better for the e-shop to have its own CW than to use a third-party CW. (4) The degree of decrease in utility for consumers who buy via the CW significantly influences both parties’ pricing strategies. More interesting is that a smaller degree of decrease in utility for consumers who buy via the CW is always beneficial to the e-shop, but may be detrimental to the CW.","['Yong-Wu Zhou', 'Bin Cao', 'Qinshen Tang', 'Wenhui Zhou']",b98ae5dd-4ed8-4a18-a772-f1fa4e4eef75,0,"['5077abb8-e5b5-4b88-b547-23e27e004596', '5307eef0-d682-4d46-b04e-e83c8f532032', '65d4744f-728b-456f-875c-4e187f56660e', '67f460c4-de5e-43e7-ae53-bdc0c0972c55', 'ee63d662-88ad-45f3-a992-2552845e91ac']",Pricing and rebate strategies for an e-shop with a cashback website,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
641,"Why do researchers on the verge of breakthrough sometimes miss the discovery? While extensive literatures have modeled the course of successful discovery and pinpointed factors associated with groundbreaking discoveries, I focus on understanding why near misses occur by interviewing scientists who were very close to discovering the ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference breakthrough in biology but ultimately missed out. I identify three mechanisms rooted in paradigmatic rigidity that led to the seminal discovery being missed several times: not noticing or recognizing anomalies, actively resisting solutions, and failing to make the link between communities. These findings shed light on the process of breakthrough by clarifying that a better understanding of the mechanism behind near misses is crucial to mitigating them, saving time, and, consequently, boosting productivity and impact. They also have implications for boosting creative breakthrough performance in academic institutions and science-based firms, a...",['Sen Chai'],27185f24-6c94-4ef9-b84f-cc39f73dd09f,0,"['791e2ccb-1be9-488f-8814-7e68adc13542', 'db6c56f8-2566-4afa-8d83-ccb202f91432', 'f6fd8641-a966-4686-935b-5d28ee1dd605', 'f9a1d5de-3404-40c0-adba-4342ee7a64a7']",Near Misses in the Breakthrough Discovery Process,Organization Science,2017

643,"We model the priority sequencing problem in a Make-to-Order (MTO) production system where the customers specify the amount of time they are willing to wait for their orders to be fulfilled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The objective function is the sum of a fixed and a variable cost of tardiness that combines two external customer-related criteria: “on-time probability of orders” and “expected tardiness of orders”. We benchmark several simple rules against the optimal policy and analyze the efficient frontier of on-time probability and expected tardiness. Our numerical results show that it is possible to obtain near optimal performance by employing simple rules. Whenever a fixed cost of tardiness is involved, the optimal priority sequencing policy deviates from the earliest-due-date (EDD) principle, however, an adjusted EDD rule performs well. Furthermore, postponement of priority sequencing decisions until the next completion improves performance.","['Miray Öner-Közen', 'Stefan Minner']",db830199-b302-46b2-9058-c496c67e9c44,0,"['04e76bac-4244-46db-8bd2-ac7fa2b8f710', '19d7c67f-fb50-4485-bec7-5204c883efc7', '38d32ea0-4225-486d-9bd0-c6de5967e597', '6d055c12-27e7-46de-8696-178025edffef', '821d3dca-5973-444f-aec7-488a1c543b92', 'acb84815-9737-4903-a1ce-ae4878cb2cb6', 'afb38502-2cb8-438f-833a-7d8fd4fbbea0', 'b0727fc6-b2ba-497e-ab75-69e2bddc4997', 'b66a7576-d31a-48e4-88dc-2239f9f51af6', 'c4c104a6-d72e-43be-a775-d25bbd23b77f', 'f2f82c18-e45a-4aa5-b888-04dcdfa40f77']",Impact of Priority Sequencing Decisions on On-Time Probability and Expected Tardiness of Orders in Make-To-Order Production Systems with External Due-Dates,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
644,"Despite extensive studies on the Internet topology, little is still known about the AS level topology of the African Internet, especially when it comes to its IXP substrate. The main reason for this is the lack of vantage points that are needed to obtain the proper information. From 2013 to 2016, we enhanced the RIPE Atlas measurement infrastructure in the region to shed light on both IPv4 and IPv6 topologies interconnecting local ISPs. We increased the number of vantage points in Africa by 278.3% and carried out measurements between them at random periods. To infer results that depict the behavior of ISPs in the region, we propose reproducible traceroute data analysis techniques suitable for the treatment of any set of similar measurements. We first reveal a large variety of ISP transit habits and their dependence on socio-economic factors. We then compare QoS within African countries, European countries, and the US to find that West African networks in particular need to promote investments in fiber networks and to implement traffic engineering techniques. Our results indicate the remaining dominance of ISPs based outside Africa for the provision of intra-continental paths, but also shed light on traffic localization efforts. We map, in our traceroute data, 62.2% of the IXPs in Africa and infer their respective peers. Finally, we highlight the launch of new IXPs and quantify their impacts on end-to-end connectivity. The study clearly demonstrates that to better assess interdomain routing in a continent, it is necessary to perform measurements from a diversified range of vantage points.","['Roderick Fanou', 'Pierre Francois', 'Emile Aben', 'Michuki Mwangi', 'Nishal Goburdhan', 'Francisco Valera']",4eafeffb-b71d-4359-8872-d801ff18d716,0,"['0231b21d-378b-4c64-b6d3-efa3c9eaad90', '08657f09-0713-42dd-8b5e-e13d0adaaaf8', '18fec6d5-477d-4570-9061-5e5b5f018a10', '28999773-9697-4226-8b0a-5fbc51217708', '2bab04c8-e9b8-4da1-88eb-abd2e99aa4d5', '3ef3d3a4-6a5a-411a-8796-a061329dcb33', '644e2e6c-7466-4d5f-bb95-1c61b5a88819', '65984a21-ec7f-4fa7-b36b-75684e8939a6', '71c34cf6-9ba3-4148-9ccc-cd9e548bb44c', '75adaa1f-3b3c-41db-a036-39a3c8cb37d4', '76327ac6-3492-4459-922f-5dd5423264e5', '9bd33641-9e51-48a4-a0a7-e5919e9c34ed', 'a5945816-688b-4848-884e-391f5e8daf38', 'b11fa79b-cf47-407e-8b64-cdce369f8145', 'cd5e11b1-760c-47f3-abb3-254bfd67f47c', 'd8d45f06-8f07-4d67-919d-46071c69593f', 'ed59559c-48ae-4422-b414-c0e9cb10e6c4', 'f606223f-1993-4565-a808-560a601e1a07']",Four Years Tracking Unrevealed Topological Changes in the African Interdomain,Computer Communications,2017
645,"The rise in the cases of motor impairing illnesses demands the research for improvements in rehabilitation therapy. Due to the current situation that the service of the professional therapists cannot meet the need of the motor-impaired subjects, a cloud robotic system is proposed to provide an Internet-based process for upper-limb rehabilitation with multimodal interaction. In this system, therapists and subjects are connected through the Internet using client/server architecture. At the client site, gradual virtual games are introduced so that the subjects can control and interact with virtual objects through the interaction devices such as robot arms. Computer graphics show the geometric results and interaction haptic/force is fed back during exercising. Both video/audio information and kinematical/physiological data are transferred to the therapist for monitoring and analysis. In this way, patients can be diagnosed and directed and therapists can manage therapy sessions remotely. The rehabilitation process can be monitored through the Internet. Expert libraries on the central server can serve as a supervisor and give advice based on the training data and the physiological data. The proposed solution is a convenient application that has several features taking advantage of the extensive technological utilization in the area of physical rehabilitation and multimodal interaction.","['Huijun Li', 'Aiguo Song']",6378b5da-5785-4939-9d6a-b22527a6805a,0,"['1c6066c3-06ac-4378-a320-85ef3afb4889', '525e4b51-adbf-46b6-8120-d038b00fa3d3', '8d619940-0214-4173-9a81-931b6fbda236', 'c3f3fc3e-6225-4381-b780-c184080ebc4d', 'f1b9d961-61bd-4ac8-a33c-d46b704f1c6b', 'f73ae390-684d-46cc-affd-6a1e59353200']",Architectural Design of a Cloud Robotic System for Upper-Limb Rehabilitation with Multimodal Interaction,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,2017

Conditions for passivity of discrete-time two-dimensional switched systems are obtained without the requirement of passivity of subsystems. When the system states are completely available, state feedback controllers and switching laws are designed. In the case of partial state measurements, dynamic output feedback controllers and switching laws depending only on the state of the output feedback controllers are constructed to guarantee passivity of the closed-loop switched system. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the results.","['Jingbo Gao', 'Weiqun Wang']",e937118e-4c12-4aed-9faf-47a704a85f87,0,"['08d8436c-5ce8-4798-b446-00217f2e025a', '10aa53d2-4774-49a1-a80c-b557d70c2f8a', '1da8c816-1167-4035-8490-96f5f6e74c4c', '2b0b410b-1b89-4acd-9774-c413a915d1f5', '2e3012a6-4d16-43aa-8b52-376fb5523e59', '422f323e-ecba-4f81-98b7-3a5badcc2e6d', '43c2580c-6cf6-4cf6-95ef-79abe7980230', '4e90c8e6-82f5-43a1-9bc8-0eb8b3f5b075', '59fd6645-ff39-473f-b1a0-9e2dc68f33b3', '693f198b-432b-4b98-be98-dc2ee0154209', '77a97d5a-b1bb-4cab-8cb4-4def1a6a4b44', '9cd0c48c-c95f-4898-8144-c710a7987d2a', 'ef9bb9cf-50b7-4848-8890-f3085560cf8a', 'f5390b26-7dfe-4264-8d1b-c8a9bea2a328', 'f6106706-6995-4990-acee-8fa1466911e3']",Passivity analysis and control for discrete-time two-dimensional switched systems in Roesser model,International Journal of Systems Science,2017
647,"A new combinatorial model for clustering is proposed for all applications in which individual and relational data are available. Individual data refer to the intrinsic features of units, they are stored in a matrix D, and are the typical input of all clustering algorithms proposed so far. Relational data refer to the observed links between units, representing social ties such as friendship, joint participation to social events, and so on. Relational data are stored in the graph G=(V,E), and the data available for clustering are the triplet G=(V,E,D), called attributed graph. Known clustering algorithms can take advantage of the relational structure of G to redefine and refine the units membership. For example, uncertain membership of units to groups can be resolved using the sociological principle that ties are more likely to form between similar units. The model proposed here shows how to take into account the graph information, combining the clique partitioning objective function (a known clustering methodology) with connectivity as the structural constraint of the resulting clusters. The model can be formulated and solved using Integer Linear Programming and a new family of cutting planes. Moderate size problems are solved, and heuristic procedures are developed for instances in which the optimal solution can only be approximated. Finally, tests conducted on simulated data show that the clusters quality is greatly improved through this methodology.","['Stefano Benati', 'Justo Puerto', 'Antonio M.

648,"Urban travel times are rather variable as a result of a lot of stochastic factors both in traffic flows, signals, and other conditions on the infrastructure. However, the most common way both in literature and practice is to estimate or predict only expected travel times, not travel time distributions. By doing so, it fails to provide full insight into the travel time dynamics and variability on urban roads. Another limitation of this common approach is that the effect of traffic measures on travel time reliability cannot be evaluated. In this paper, an analytical travel time distribution model is presented especially for urban roads with fixed-time controlled intersections by investigating the underlying mechanisms of urban travel times.

Enhancing the engagement of citizens within these communities is a focus of attention for researchers and practitioners who want to amplify the impact on learning, science and society. This study investigates the relationship between engagement factors and behaviour patterns in an online community that requires high levels of citizen participation.

Data were collected from log files and questionnaires, and multiple measures of engagement were examined: engagement metrics, roles, motivation, attitude, satisfaction and belonging to the community. The results allowed comparison of the engagement levels among different types of citizen participation communities and categorised members in engagement profiles, according to their behaviour patterns. Findings indicate a need for differing design approaches based on the type of citizen participation community and individual engagement profiles.","['Maria Aristeidou', 'Eileen Scanlon', 'Mike Sharples']",9b5eaa96-5819-4d36-b66c-793a5e5cf6d3,0,"['04194f02-2618-45e3-adfa-d3d481d9dc24', '0ae9cc53-1e52-462d-a223-00a15bd14c13', '25a8bab5-b514-444f-8ec4-01b478dc866e', '267abc3e-6b44-4643-bb4d-e1e7a4ec9aec', '2d0f74a5-1f51-4aa7-b909-78cec4d64971', '34c43a88-ad0f-4a6f-bcd4-28f0d7fa37ba', '38135245-8eff-4078-af6a-ea559ffa660b', '4f0c5c37-3e75-4fa3-b56a-c79ea4f2720d', '561b6563-d46f-407e-a4fc-7991bc0e01cd', '60eb3710-3c67-4a82-9f94-990ce9f05e67', '66666a89-b004-4e9e-ba61-be541b14acef', '73e63ef6-23e5-4cc3-a4f3-894c8b74ffe0', '7f4ba950-45fe-4e76-b5b0-8146cc801a30', '7f93cdfc-c3b0-4ad7-8959-ccc830dac38d', '8763e9d1-5c0e-43dc-8082-adba05a37b6b', '8dad19f4-9e86-4fbb-8150-e6653cff1c2c', 'a48daa07-7f4f-4cb5-ae9a-5fa009cf7d21', 'aa08d40f-2000-4828-bfc5-fba0fb064fc2', 'bad502e2-69d9-416e-b38d-080208bf2af2', 'bb4b3e89-f152-489d-8df8-3267906eb44c', 'cac90094-2806-46d6-ac96-8caa9a8c3df6', 'f215677a-820b-4806-8785-591c1351841e', 'f9a7f521-13e9-4570-89f6-2737ec9aa5dc', 'fffcaa8c-7ea9-4f15-99fe-6982b6eef109']",Profiles of engagement in online communities of citizen science participation,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
652,"Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a de-facto standard for practitioners working in the Business Process Management (BPM) field. The BPMN standard [1] offers high-level modeling constructs, such as subprocesses, events, data and message flows, lanes, and is widely used to model processes in various domains. Recently several BPMN-based process mining techniques [2, 3, 4] were introduced. These techniques allow representing processes, discovered from the event logs of process-aware information systems, in a convenient way, using the BPMN standard. To test these mining approaches an appropriate tool for the generation of event logs from BPMN models is needed. In this work we suggest such a tool. We propose a formal token-based executable BPMN semantics, which takes into account BPMN 2.0 with its expressive constructs. The developed tool is based on these semantics and allows simulation of hierarchical process models (including models with cancellations), models with data flows and pools, and models interacting through message flows. To manage the control flow, script-based gateways and choice preferences are implemented as well. The proposed simulation technique was implemented on top of existing plug-ins for ProM (Process Mining Framework) [5], and was verified on models created by practitioners from various domains.","['Alexey A.

654,"In artificial intelligence, it is important to handle and analyse inconsistency in knowledge bases. Inconsistent pieces of information suggest questions like “where is the inconsistency?” and “how severe is it?”. Inconsistency measures have been proposed to tackle the latter issue, but the former seems underdeveloped and is the focus of this paper. Minimal inconsistent sets have been the main tool to localise inconsistency, but we argue that they are like the exposed part of an iceberg, failing to capture contradictions hidden under the water. Using classical propositional logic, we develop methods to characterise when a formula is contributing to the inconsistency in a knowledge base and when a set of formulas can be regarded as a primitive conflict. To achieve this, we employ an abstract consequence operation to “look beneath the water level”, generalising the minimal inconsistent set concept and the related free formula notion. We apply the framework presented to the problem of measuring inconsistency in knowledge bases, putting forward relaxed forms for two debatable postulates for inconsistency measures. Finally, we discuss the computational complexity issues related to the introduced concepts.","['Glauber De Bona', 'Anthony Hunter']",56a927c9-c859-4098-81ef-9a439f88c624,0,"['0ac69b3d-a3fa-4eea-9ca2-f1cda4f73a24', '0e527168-ea83-4e7d-9230-166a8abbf3d1', '156e77ce-cb57-4ced-bcea-c99b7dfb5d3b', '16873e8f-5ab5-479d-853a-1efc34319d02', '25b00128-9f92-408a-9994-d6c512558029', '2a2ae9ef-426a-4fa1-9feb-7765c9b51277', '2a73f987-98cc-4d8b-bf27-9d8d0834c57c', '2ae95c3b-0e6d-4445-9528-f303f4e8aaea', '3f47bada-7469-4be6-b1bb-22c9fa914e8f', '4a7336f5-320b-42fe-a628-ca1f4e391ad2', '4af99581-618b-45a3-8e55-6d508a9cebd6', '525fad4d-8c5e-4777-9ba8-5ea716d89af0', '5ad1a801-f2c6-4ba4-b8f7-95b96744b069', '5e1cad30-6c4f-4917-aa9b-6e33fba035a6', '68aacd92-21b5-4aa5-b12c-0064846dc215', '7be872ed-cafa-4eee-a93d-ba45a8b5f2f3', '91ce18c5-23fd-41a1-9d5b-d38878f182fd', '9e12f133-d971-49f7-bf93-41f389eff446', 'a2ccf0aa-fecd-4e2c-b5be-5cb267fec4eb', 'a5667528-bd88-4dee-a271-44458606a527', 'a6356615-36c4-49f7-8564-b2d71c2cd6c7', 'afc6c2c5-ab0b-411a-9498-61deb2b4d3c5', 'b3a6f742-8207-4274-b7d6-cdbefa3e8938', 'b3ffa522-253e-4f0d-80a6-057ac4f82465', 'b9190bc8-b5a9-431b-ae63-b95263c7f397', 'bc37a48b-5169-4f48-997d-faa045858af8', 'c5cad88f-3a5b-4a4f-8c03-c80f89ff6769', 'c8b82b67-6751-43bb-a6c5-aaf27146bcb6', 'd1f4ddc8-7dda-4683-a1fe-4062ba68d5a8', 'd8467c08-cc63-4bcf-af4b-04d45f047dfa', 'dcfb9601-f022-435a-92ca-cebd8d448d25', 'fbdde38f-d962-4da8-a383-5ac5001c8ad4']",Localising iceberg inconsistencies,Artificial Intelligence,2017

657,"The human brain’s ability to efficiently detect patterns from the continuous streaming sensory stimuli has been a source of constant intrigue for naturalists, and has set the course for the development of research into artificial intelligence. Efficient encoding of such input stimuli into discrete timing of events play a decisive role in the ability of the spiking neurons inside the human brain to compress, transmit and recognise information presented by the external environment. In this article, we introduce the spike-time or temporal encoding paradigm as an efficient general approach to data compression for the purpose of pattern recognition. The data compression through spike-time encoding not only dramatically reduces the volume of data required to capture discriminatory information leading to economical storage and transmission, but can also be used for pattern recognition in streaming data domain. We experimentally show that the spike-time data produced by the temporal encoding techniques achieve comparable (superior in some cases) performance of pattern recognition in comparison to the use of the whole raw data. This article also introduces a generalised background knowledge driven optimisation based temporal encoding framework for encoding time series data and as an illustration of this approach, further formulates a temporal encoding algorithm, namely GAGamma, designed to efficiently compress fMRI data using discrete spike-times. We have evaluated the temporal encoding algorithms on the benchmark Starplus fMRI dataset, and the results demonstrate the temporal encoding algorithm’s ability to achieve significant data compression without sacrificing the performance of the pattern recognition in the compressed space. We also show that the GAGamma algorithm provides enhanced flexibility and control (compared to the state of the art temporal encoding algorithms) within the design framework of the temporal encoding problem for fMRI, leading to better quality of spike-time data. The proposed approach, by the use of efficient brain-like encoding mechanism, opens up new possibilities in information compression, communication and pattern recognition and thus is applicable to a range of new applications.","['Neelava Sengupta', 'Nikola Kasabov']",f1ed4223-69a5-4b07-9160-a38df3a730b5,0,"['0c0404b0-f23d-4b86-9097-d718a166ca06', '293971a9-15e0-4a32-9c76-8a9704e304c2', '64da2748-6705-4ea8-be42-9e3337c298e8', '690935d1-963b-4f34-950c-016c5b91723d', '69801ff8-7d5d-4067-aaf4-acc6735a7953', '6cbcb9df-b871-424c-9518-73606819b52b', '726bfb7e-d62c-4830-9975-0faba184dbcc', '84596c71-8827-42fd-8fba-ab8afedadc16', '95b3cde7-32c2-42bd-85b7-3cf6015f44f6', '9b8c8ff0-7fe2-4cb3-a6fd-94f91b6a5d36', 'b0dbd57d-b349-4c31-a5b7-042c5654e1e3', 'd3569a19-f7c2-4a91-8f1f-ef9e92b9ba94', 'fd421f52-8004-496b-8262-790d8d069f8a', 'ff381e42-12ca-48d8-ade1-d8f0738ba187']",Spike-time encoding as a data compression technique for pattern recognition of temporal data,Information Sciences,2017
658,"In this paper, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based approach is proposed to solve the optimal tracking control problem (OTCP) for continuous–time (CT) affine nonlinear systems using general value iteration (VI). First, the tracking performance criterion is described in a total-cost manner without a discount term which can ensure the asymptotic stability of the tracking error. Then, some mild assumptions are assumed to relax the restriction of the initial admissible control in most existing references. Based on the proposed assumptions, the general VI method is proposed and three situations are considered to show the convergence with any initial positive performance function. To validate the theoretical results, the proposed general VI method is implemented by two neural networks on a nonlinear spring–mass–damper system and two situations are considered to show the effectiveness.","['Geyang Xiao', 'Huaguang Zhang', 'Yanhong Luo', 'Qiuxia Qu']",2c30df27-0ebb-4c11-9713-a73846e97902,0,"['058d2fdd-5fce-4c44-b4be-68a2f501db7b', '08298542-c6c8-4956-902a-b3c68716950a', '085cac06-1d5a-44ad-bde4-6f27fe9bbc2f', '0a859f44-c6b0-4847-ab15-ad0080f9b5dd', '0c8f3458-fbab-4a9c-a222-fed8e5762941', '10fbf462-52a0-48ec-9123-1b394edb772c', '12164024-0161-4044-8c9a-9ebc86e649bd', '15aaa03d-bbd3-4874-9734-49d14669b0a1', '163d38aa-b245-4170-92a1-8d889b7cb6bb', '1b16e6db-0e01-45f6-881b-317e9a937bde', '1ee1a6f7-cac2-49c9-ae07-06b4029b5e90', '22877775-b41f-47f0-888e-eabd61665470', '29aab996-1d10-49cb-8a6a-0ecf0ad946fe', '2a60d061-578b-41ee-9d23-1416a39df603', '2f0df1e6-4801-45f6-a592-f7d33dd97b1d', '3087e6ed-0e7f-4c99-bdb9-13ac9a2b718c', '31e24dcb-ab9e-4db5-aba0-2d473fe17c57', '36560d30-24e6-40df-9cb3-32b38980312d', '5b0e482c-5e15-4008-aa86-e9143ec25572', '6d9b0dfe-5a81-41d0-9f95-13fe1e3f459c', '6fa5c40c-1435-451f-a06d-a4981085e7cb', '7218fb82-090a-4fb6-bb58-55abc3ef6db9', '75fe0cb4-6e4a-4af8-88af-e4034152cc33', '777089ed-bc42-430a-82e7-f541f28f5009', '789a3055-baca-42df-8814-d5be42a7c5ff', '8621c7a5-12ec-4c7c-b0b8-f8bed354efb9', '86c392d3-764e-42ff-b2fe-c8f020e6fa06', '8712a494-25bc-4526-b8a2-3108e3306748', '9e85475f-9d83-4d38-b66a-84c2f845d113', 'a3177134-5122-422b-88ce-afcabb4c78cf', 'ac20299a-8f6a-451a-bf49-8391b72f37d0', 'ad2892fa-1f01-4810-8215-9820cd22a413', 'bdf64955-b076-47c3-bd95-203369685712', 'c37ee891-e5b4-4ff7-a246-7834fed202ed', 'caabf683-5747-4671-a480-862f95d17a6f', 'dfcf776f-5b9c-4302-9907-70046186a74d']",General value iteration based reinforcement learning for solving optimal tracking control problem of continuous–time affine nonlinear systems,Neurocomputing,2017

661,"In this paper, the role of unidirectional limited rate transmitter cooperation is studied for the two-user symmetric Z interference channel (Z-IC) with secrecy constraints at the receivers, in achieving two conflicting goals simultaneously:  mitigating interference  and  ensuring secrecy . First, the problem is studied under the linear deterministic model. A novel scheme for partitioning the encoded messages and outputs based on the relative strengths of the signal and interference is proposed. The partitioning reveals the side information that needs to be provided to the receiver and facilitates the development of tight outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region. The achievable schemes for the deterministic model use a fusion of cooperative precoding and transmission of a jamming signal. The optimality of the proposed scheme is established for the deterministic model for all possible parameter settings. The insights obtained from the deterministic model are used to derive inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region of the two-user Gaussian symmetric Z-IC. The achievable scheme for the Gaussian model uses stochastic encoding in addition to cooperative precoding and transmission of a jamming signal. For the Gaussian case, the secure sum generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF) is characterized and shown to be optimal for the weak/moderate interference regime. It is also shown that the secure sum capacity lies within 2 bits/s/Hz of the outer bound for the weak/moderate interference regime for all values of the capacity of the cooperative link. Interestingly, in the deterministic model, it is found that there is no penalty on the capacity region of the Z-IC due to the secrecy constraints at the receivers in the weak/moderate interference regimes. Similarly, it is found that there is no loss in the secure sum GDOF for the Gaussian case due to the secrecy constraint at the receiver, in the weak/moderate interference regimes. The results highlight the importance of cooperation in facilitating secure communication over the Z-IC.","['Parthajit Mohapatra', 'Chandra R.

After considering a more general case of the predictor feedback controllers, the design procedure is transformed into the stabilisation problem of the system controlled by a dynamic output feedback controller. By proposing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, the predictor feedback gains are then synthesised from the stability conditions which are obtained in form of linear matrix inequalities. Such design approach is more flexible and extendable in comparison to one used by the conventional predictor feedback control. As a simulation example, the designed extended predictor feedback controller is applied on an active suspension system and is used to stabilise an unstable system with input delays.

663,"Numerical models of fluid flows calculate the resolved flow at a given grid resolution. The smallest wave resolved by the numerical scheme is deemed the effective resolution. Advection schemes are an important part of the numerical models used for computational fluid dynamics. For example, in atmospheric dynamical cores they control the transport of tracers. For linear schemes solving the advection equation, the effective resolution can be calculated analytically using dispersion analysis. Here, a numerical test is developed that can calculate the effective resolution of any scheme (linear or non-linear) for the advection equation.#R##N##R##N#The tests are focused on the use of non-linear limiters for advection schemes. It is found that the effective resolution of such non-linear schemes is very dependent on the number of time steps. Initially, schemes with limiters introduce large errors. Therefore, their effective resolution is poor over a small number of time steps. As the number of time steps increases the error of non-linear schemes grows at a smaller rate than that of the linear schemes which improves their effective resolution considerably. The tests highlight that a scheme that produces large errors over one time step might not produce a large accumulated error over a number of time steps. The results show that, in terms of effective-resolution, there is little benefit in using higher than third-order numerical accuracy with traditional limiters. The use of weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, or relaxed and quasi-monotonic limiters, which allow smooth extrema, can eliminate this reduction in effective resolution and enable higher than third-order accuracy.","['James Kent', 'Christiane Jablonowski', 'Jared P.

664,"Kinship verification is receiving increasing attention among computer vision researchers due to interesting applications ranging from family album management to searching missing family members. Existing approaches have focused on using face images to decode kinship information. In contrast, this paper explores the effectiveness of periocular region in verifying kinship from images captured in the wild. Further, we also propose a block-based neighborhood repulsed metric learning (BNRML) framework, an extension of NRML, to yield more discriminative power. The proposed method learns multiple local distance metrics from different blocks of the images represented by local ternary patterns. Moreover, to contemplate diversity in discrimination power of different blocks, weighted score-level fusion scheme is used to obtain a similarity score of image pair.

665,"ABSTRACTThis paper presents an adaptive neural tracking control scheme for strict-feedback stochastic nonlinear systems with guaranteed transient and steady-state performance under arbitrary switchings. First, by utilising the prescribed performance control, the prescribed tracking control performance can be ensured, while the requirement for the initial error is removed. Second, radial basis function neural networks approximation are used to handle unknown nonlinear functions and stochastic disturbances. At last, by using the common Lyapunov function method and the backstepping technique, a common adaptive neural controller is constructed. The designed controller overcomes the problem of the over-parameterisation, and further alleviates the computational burden. Under the proposed common adaptive controller, all the signals in the closed-loop system are 4-Moment (or 2 Moment) semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the prescribed tracking control performance are guaranteed under arbitrary switchi...","['Wenjie Si', 'Xunde Dong', 'Feifei Yang']",b0b56860-f08a-4b44-bafa-fe04f75d5bc1,0,"['03bfd5ef-5224-4de9-91f6-d5b5a5917e8b', '051c9f57-4bf4-4d4a-9bc3-63424d180c55', '0c94c5c3-01f3-4785-94b3-cfccf723630b', '1edba8b1-3af3-4333-8f1c-eee37a2b39a6', '2289a9a5-7781-4545-a10d-1063359bc66a', '231aca4a-7c4f-468a-a7eb-f5cb5fc330fc', '29606d2a-e0c2-483f-a2dd-55425aac1d4f', '30123dad-6927-4199-8d1e-f71b29376ae7', '3c3ed4e1-52c6-460b-8e8f-5f9b82c778b8', '3e04f8f8-d8e3-4122-943c-dc5b858b55ec', '3f326635-79ae-49de-bf38-9a1881dbe41a', '4490d3ae-df15-49cf-8a01-f33136ef18b9', '4586d0e7-de22-4b43-becf-adc2e5f7aa8e', '4ed7c2ff-a9e3-40e2-9100-ae50288d5436', '55b2e002-1648-48f3-81cb-d6187d898fdc', '6afa1eec-9266-4177-a60e-02032f6c9772', '7693bf0e-ee7e-45d2-9257-8c07406f69e1', '7aefdb89-17c9-4d16-96ee-5eb44e82cf81', '7e15f4c6-ad41-4843-9c08-acf331192d17', '8457f0a3-5316-40f4-9088-a347f1cd39d4', '98d011f5-3d5b-4e2f-9eac-eb533140d6f3', 'a41160c6-3fb1-4bac-979d-3cc001b7b809', 'a445e70e-d5ea-4741-a01e-e55427a027b5', 'b05c1ca8-c699-4dfa-ad6a-0d1c417234e3', 'c0e7ecf7-80be-4e04-a704-0b24dccfc08b', 'ccc33d39-72da-48d2-a921-26d360ea8814', 'd7181982-6044-4aa1-8238-19d997b446be', 'da97fba5-f37d-4b50-9ab4-abbeda04fc31', 'f6654905-1dd8-4760-bf9f-b4c39b081a57', 'fae741f1-0c78-4892-a946-cdf08e7310fc']",Adaptive neural prescribed performance control for a class of strict-feedback stochastic nonlinear systems under arbitrary switchings,International Journal of Systems Science,2017
666,The clustering of customer transaction data is very important to retail and e-commerce companies. The authors propose a local PurTree spectral clustering algorithm for massive customer transaction data that uses a purchase tree to represent customer transaction data and a PurTree distance to compute the distance between two trees. The new method learns a data similarity matrix from the local distances and the level weights in the PurTree distance simultaneously. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the proposed model. The authors conducted experiments to compare their method with four commonly used clustering method for transaction data on six real-life datasets. The experimental results show that the new method outperformed other clustering algorithms.,"['Xiaojun Chen', 'Si Peng', 'Joshua Zhexue Huang', 'Feiping Nie', 'Yong Ming']",e5223ee7-c24c-4a62-a228-96d79808af7d,0,"['15f521cc-944e-43cc-8162-d49a326be357', '1e3fe185-0e17-4494-a226-d3b5ce6af500', '5f08276a-5b31-4517-88b5-70672876f765', '6e8022d7-46dc-4933-a579-8c111e68a8ae', '9c30e1f0-a39a-4a98-8f2e-b91c6420944c', '9f573ca4-84f7-4ddb-81cc-6a7b3a13e162', 'd3e9c534-c1e7-45d2-b34b-b064462edcac', 'ef05dedb-b88b-4772-9762-2b6a6c94bfbb']",Local PurTree Spectral Clustering for Massive Customer Transaction Data,IEEE Intelligent Systems,2017
667,"File systems that employ write-optimized dictionaries (WODs) can perform random-writes, metadata updates, and recursive directory traversals orders of magnitude faster than conventional file systems. However, previous WOD-based file systems have not obtained all of these performance gains without sacrificing performance on other operations, such as file deletion, file or directory renaming, or sequential writes.   Using three techniques,  late-binding journaling ,  zoning , and  range deletion , we show that there is no fundamental trade-off in write-optimization. These dramatic improvements can be retained while matching conventional file systems on  all  other operations.   BetrFS 0.2 delivers order-of-magnitude better performance than conventional file systems on directory scans and small random writes and matches the performance of conventional file systems on rename, delete, and sequential I/O. For example, BetrFS 0.2 performs directory scans 2.2 × faster, and small random writes over two orders of magnitude faster, than the fastest conventional file system. But unlike BetrFS 0.1, it renames and deletes files commensurate with conventional file systems and performs large sequential I/O at nearly disk bandwidth. The performance benefits of these techniques extend to applications as well. BetrFS 0.2 continues to outperform conventional file systems on many applications, such as as rsync, git-diff, and tar, but improves git-clone performance by 35% over BetrFS 0.1, yielding performance comparable to other file systems.","['Jun Yuan', 'Yang Zhan', 'William Jannen', 'Prashant Pandey', 'Amogh Akshintala', 'Kanchan Chandnani', 'Pooja Deo', 'Zardosht Kasheff', 'Leif Walsh', 'Michael A.

668,"Stereo matching algorithms attempt to estimate depth from the images obtained by two cameras. In most cases, the arrangement of cameras (their locations and orientations with respect to the scene) is determined based on human experience. In this paper, it is shown that the camera arrangement can be optimized using the concept of correspondence field (CF) for better acquisition of depth. Specifically, this paper demonstrates the relationship between the CF of a pair of cameras and depth estimation accuracy and presents a method to optimize their arrangement based on the gradient of the CF. The experimental results show that a pair of cameras optimized by the proposed method can improve the accuracy of depth estimation by as much as 30% compared with the conventional camera arrangements.","['Shichao Fu', 'Farzad Safaei', 'Wanqing Li']",792141ec-69b2-4c35-bda2-d946c583234e,0,"['0e5936eb-3bec-40c4-92f3-40df3a74601c', '1ac99581-6b62-48d0-a3dd-a55b96dd3b91', '1da134dd-cb05-40c8-a872-ee8a92e920df', '1e883184-4ab0-45a9-9e8e-d9a56b8cc115', '1f520d1a-5870-477d-85d7-0f50be690ea7', '29dea5f2-0909-4e30-a1cc-37005cf5e179', '32068750-6426-4e8f-8279-9e810b6211b9', '33e37bf9-56af-4f21-8c0f-8e07d363fdb9', '488e7c28-7c9f-4ff3-9f82-e70cd72cb415', '4b14896c-cc68-49bc-a9be-76f0dbdd8f6e', '4d0e34be-c78f-4d30-a74e-9790523b20a2', '5e146681-068f-47b8-99b9-90589f85109c', '617da901-5260-443f-abb6-51ff073ded26', '6d5c6ccc-0eb1-4390-86c3-540f95568c4c', '86dc6f26-774f-4027-be2a-cf8720c5c102', '892a5a23-469c-4806-9a34-57d5b3f8c302', '894e6710-2aa8-413e-bb5e-06b04889307b', '96b94b90-3de3-4512-8a83-6d5df73539bc', 'b0b1fe69-89a7-4d70-ad62-15ddcbd767c2', 'bba08d7d-c141-4f7a-bcf0-3fc5c2d48299', 'c7e1dee0-ad2d-4356-86ad-25e55517f4e7', 'c8e70567-3cbb-405d-bdc7-16aab4ded4fd', 'cda74be9-e60b-4aa0-a3dd-924206ff27d9', 'ce71a075-0d85-4ac7-9f7f-180ed18d9f3a', 'd6e692b3-4ccb-49cc-8ded-a85bed679450', 'd6fd51c6-d1a9-4477-b36b-d2d1fdeec591', 'e3a40536-5580-4c24-b273-4fa4dab2579e', 'e802578d-5fee-4b9e-9055-8fdfd87b7aee', 'f394ab98-a4ea-4c90-b2ae-e354639a59e3']",Optimization of Camera Arrangement Using Correspondence Field to Improve Depth Estimation,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
669,"In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) of mobile education (such as mobile learning), in order to keep a better and lower energy consumption, reduce the energy hole and prolong the network life cycle, we propose a novel unequal clustering routing protocol considering energy balancing based on network partition & distance (UCNPD, which means Unequal Clustering based on Network Partition & Distance) for WSN in this paper. In the design model of this protocol, we know that all the network node data reaches the base station (BS) through the nodes near the BS, and the nodes in this area will use more energy, so we define a ring area using the BS as the center to form a circle, then we partition the network area based on the distance from node to the BS. These parts of nodes are to build connection with the BS, and the others follow the optimized clustering routing service protocol which uses a timing mechanism to elect the cluster head. It reduces the energy consumption of cluster reconstruction. Furthermore, we build unequal clusters by setting different competitive radius, which is helpful for balancing the network energy consumption. For the selection of message route, we considered all the energy of cluster head, the distances to BS and the degrees of node to reduce and balance the energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the protocol can efficiently decrease the speed of the nodes death, prolong the network lifetime, and balance the energy dissipation of all nodes.","['Degan Zhang', 'Si Liu', 'Ting Zhang', 'Zhao Liang']",41613086-70bf-4049-ad0f-3528b2aee7bb,0,"['13c33d81-d19d-4056-8cf3-148b0c95db1d', '199cef83-72e3-48b2-8bd0-ab4d45cac01a', '1ad9438d-5dd3-434d-a28c-86a09c5499f3', '1ee4b656-7d2c-45e8-b2e8-b5633b992eeb', '2d807ca2-276e-45f1-924c-5265abb293f6', '53977b82-192d-4ded-a5e0-836e2c75ecf7', '5549c651-ae3d-4acc-a132-54feaadcafa7', '5b8ddc3f-b63c-4fd1-98b2-0472f37a4a15', '5c3d4123-b950-4016-b9a5-a0d123be2674', '69364296-0289-44a9-aa38-f06612593dee', '77741856-1d25-490a-ad05-ec4116c1065c', '7b1c55ef-7558-4825-bf5a-4fc9a9d31320', '8966ac0b-ff51-442d-80bb-08766cc9aeaa', 'c2f49464-5a12-49b9-901c-a7215a0968d6', 'c54aaa73-6c1a-48db-a8c1-4e7f90112132', 'c81a6aa5-5685-4753-bb11-1fefbf7b82f6', 'dfd5f2b6-bcdf-4068-b642-99461207f67e', 'e5c2bc4c-e792-421a-8942-835f2f42f81d', 'e9757bf3-aa07-4db9-973f-8b0564018ad2', 'f6d1ad29-9f0a-4e2c-a120-9bd118e53cd4']",Novel unequal clustering routing protocol considering energy balancing based on network partition & distance for mobile education,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017
670,"Copy-move forgery (CMF) is a popular image manipulation technique that is simple and effective in creating forged illustrations. The bulk of CMF detection methods concentrate on common geometrical transformation attacks (e.g., rotation and scale) and post-processing attacks (e.g., Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compression and Gaussian noise addition). However, geometrical transformation that involves reflection attacks has not yet been highlighted in the literature. As the threats of reflection attack are inevitable, there is an urgent need to study CMF detection methods that are robust against this type of attack. In this study, we investigated common geometrical transformation attacks and reflection-based attacks. Also, we suggested a robust CMF detection method, called SIFT-Symmetry, that innovatively combines the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)-based CMF detection method with symmetry-based matching. We evaluated the SIFT-Symmetry with three established methods that are based on SIFT, multi-scale analysis, and patch matching using two new datasets that cover simple transformation and reflection-based attacks. The results show that the F-score of the SIFT-Symmetry method surpassed the average 80% value for all geometrical transformation cases, including simple transformation and reflection-based attacks, except for the reflection with rotation case which had an average F-score of 65.3%. The results therefore show that the SIFT-Symmetry method gives better performance compared to the other existing methods.","['Nor Bakiah Abd Warif', 'Ainuddin Wahid Abdul Wahab', 'Mohd Yamani Idna Idris', 'Rosli Salleh', 'Fazidah Othman']",5e2f6480-d88b-4e06-a2f8-2f8021a22ec8,0,"['08727293-f38c-43b7-9cb5-0995457e58b9', '15f65df0-d242-4f15-bce5-b7e27de0ae7e', '298daba3-15c7-428c-b068-a079e9df20ca', '2e9dc44f-ebb6-4236-8757-185c7bb3cd20', '723c2174-684f-4445-b91a-60a87fbac992', '735b5ed7-4e90-43a9-b21c-fdd24a49b86a', '8b8d4e2f-8e36-4308-a529-3e0433d4a706', '942bed44-61c6-4415-b0aa-417494b4cc1d', '976d68e3-5bd3-4cc3-8b39-31ac61c701a6', 'ab9d49c1-b45d-46fb-be5f-ed2abec56ccb', 'b4c79885-4bb9-44d8-84ec-64415fd150f7', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'c0cd729d-c5e1-4204-9252-4d1106b478d7', 'c4169c98-e0b0-46be-900c-6b0c5a50b239', 'daba55bb-7834-4bec-9a25-3874e4c02b9d', 'e0d4da0e-4baf-4a2a-b3cc-254e9634a1c6', 'e86b6f1c-7a58-4ca4-8c05-b8e27b0decad', 'ebfca554-7a3c-4597-954b-07336a2e3030']",SIFT-Symmetry: A robust detection method for copy-move forgery with reflection attack ☆,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017

The PVO strategy realizes hiding data in each block. Additive homomorphism guarantees the performance of PVO in encrypted domain is close to that in plain domain. Besides, the homomorphism encryption does not cause data expansion, and the payload can be further improved. With the watermarked encrypted image, if the receiver has only the data hiding key, he can extract the additional data. If the receiver has only the encryption key, he can obtain a decrypted image similar to the original one. If the receiver has both the data hiding key and the encryption key, he can extract the additional data without any error and recover the original image losslessly.","['Di Xiao', 'Yanping Xiang', 'Hongying Zheng', 'Yong Wang']",98eecc23-a7f9-4812-9b06-52421e0322b8,50,"['025bc3ba-4aee-4f93-8fad-ce1c91566e44', '094337f5-80af-498c-af22-048e90e01112', '15a1f406-81cb-4fb9-9f26-9808b7b45ce6', '2c33bdb1-6f8e-4453-8e10-5153056ae70f', '33d72eda-3c83-4883-94ae-3691dcf8c27d', '35415ca1-7c6a-4415-868c-717414173f60', '436bd6b8-78bc-480d-8988-6df8e8ca4b17', '43dc825b-4ea4-47ec-90f0-b29b990cc0b1', '5adfb916-a456-436a-b15a-ff640ae6fc10', '5f638893-e240-4336-bf85-a516dfe2051b', '7a1624d7-9b8e-44fd-a778-e0d3179b509a', '7fcd5504-d0f4-4807-b0d0-ef5940f2c26b', '83dd4552-f05e-4388-a928-bcaa1f4deb81', '8b29cd82-9434-4618-9330-886b81b33cc4', '8d87eb33-9f62-4351-94e7-e8c446766f6d', 'a593c001-4fe4-45d6-b4a6-0e1b59933e27', 'b30b4689-a847-4be4-a1b8-b9cc5a46e12c', 'b3f390f3-0a97-407a-b1f4-96761d6bee19', 'b44a64c6-db82-42de-a5e3-3e2492d01cc2', 'b5ff0abf-1959-4c04-a375-364730a1d916', 'b6ed2509-f129-417b-9b70-fcb2b067e42c', 'bce08f2e-3299-4503-8f8f-7ec33150a7af', 'c4ab7f16-144f-4eb7-9695-4a5b4c1616be', 'd6a8c1e8-b38d-4d2d-9cb1-53a9cdb6d7f9', 'd9f9b811-e05e-40cd-ad58-0173715eb5a6', 'f938a439-f364-435e-a9c5-581ff043a7a0']",Separable reversible data hiding in encrypted image based on pixel value ordering and additive homomorphism,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017
672,"The backhaul forwards aggregated traffic from massive users, machines, and sensors to the core network, and is the key infrastructure to facilitate a smart city. The beamforming and spatial multiplexing technologies enable the wireless multipoint-to-point backhaul to connect dense small cell eNodeBs (eNBs) and macrocell eNBs. Because the spatial characteristics of the backhaul channels, such as the angular power spectra and spreads, determine the interference and capacity performance of the backhaul links, accurate 3D channel modeling is vital for the evaluation and comparison of candidate proposals. In this article, the concepts and methodology of spatial channel modeling are first introduced, and the state-of-the-art models developed by the standardization bodies in recent years are surveyed. Then we present a field measurement campaign on the 3D backhaul channels in an urban street, including the channel sounder implementation, field measurement, multipath parameter estimation, and propagation modeling. The Rx of the sounder (emulating a donor eNB) was installed on the rooftop of a five-story building, and the Tx was located along a street and at different altitudes to emulate a relay eNB. The channel angular power spectra in the elevation and azimuth domains were measured, and the impact by the relay�s distance and altitude on the angular spreads was evaluated. In addition, a Laplace model is proposed for the power spectra in both domains. This article not only explains the methodology and implementation of the spatial channel measurement, but also reveals the urban wireless backhaul channel characteristics which are useful for the design and deployment of wireless backhaul for a smart city.","['Ruonan Zhang', 'Xiaohong Jiang', 'Tarik Taleb', 'Bin Li', 'Heng Qin', 'Zhimeng Zhong', 'Xiaomei Zhang']",9ee348e9-08a4-49dd-8dda-c1f492fe8ec0,0,"['01aa149b-7f77-411c-86af-6c522e6f8e89', '6e2e5d7d-81ab-4b4d-95f6-5255342cb460', 'abe74ce5-646d-4eef-86bf-b34ff2d5b7fe', 'bbc27ef3-0d43-4de2-af0b-d7b7d8e3dc8f', 'f149f371-b8bf-48cb-9e7e-6d72de164e70']",Connecting a City by Wireless Backhaul: 3D Spatial Channel Characterization and Modeling Perspectives,IEEE Communications Magazine,2017
673,"This paper introduces the problem of scheduling a dual-spreader crane when lifts are subject to a weight limit. A mathematical model is formulated and a fast method for computing a lower bound on the optimal value is proposed. An efficient heuristic approach is designed and subsequently built into a simulated annealing framework to solve the problem. The optimization and heuristic approaches are tested on problem instances of various sizes. The results indicate that the optimization approach produces proven optimal solutions to small-sized instances but fails to solve instances of practical meaning. The heuristic approach can easily match the performance of the optimization approach for small instances and outperforms the optimization approach when tackling larger instances. On average, the heuristic approach produces solutions whose objective values are within 6% of the lower bound.","['Shabnam Lashkari', 'Yong Wu', 'Matthew E. H.

However, its use in image hashing is rarely discussed yet. In this study, we investigate the use of MDS in image hashing and propose an MDS-based hashing algorithm resistant to any-angle rotation. The proposed algorithm extracts a rotation-invariant feature matrix with log-polar transform and discrete Fourier transform from the normalized image, and learns a compact and discriminative representation from the feature matrix by MDS. Experiments with 3845 images are carried out and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust to many content-preserving operations, including any-angle rotation, and reaches good discrimination. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve comparisons illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms in classification with respect to robustness and discrimination.","['Zhenjun Tang', 'Ziqing Huang', 'Xianquan Zhang', 'Huan Lao']",25225b1a-edf7-4c9e-bbf6-4767d29b0baf,0,"['03463023-6682-4154-9b15-b2c5de413af0', '05692914-e141-474f-8e0b-6d81a1eef556', '0650fb20-d07d-4c24-b4b9-b18574d85660', '13663ced-a187-42c4-b12c-fcfcf278f03b', '14c71cb3-67b9-4a9b-8a36-5c6e60eae196', '14eb49dd-a390-468b-9f93-ef1b73c411ab', '159d418c-22ae-4b87-a2b1-f811dc0350e8', '16491725-f273-4409-aa23-c662d07e7335', '1eef42ad-1eaf-4e71-a8c0-a75e7277ee6c', '2d647db4-553b-4e39-b3d2-98c2a0acba22', '2e039a57-0910-40a7-80cb-27410812ef4d', '3795f9f1-853b-4e0d-8688-2107bcd24619', '390aab8c-be9e-463c-ab2b-8164410b9887', '3f4637c0-1b89-45ec-b19a-84e8aadc6a48', '40e4846c-6d89-4695-94ec-9471998f392f', '51fc3fe8-76ca-4a98-b424-c839295a6654', '52ac21a4-58a2-4b04-b552-4a8346568904', '53a00b8a-9c53-4320-8132-67a208eebea8', '698adea0-9e7b-43b0-a573-c5e0636b5901', '6b9dc0e5-a826-492e-8e9e-d03aa636fb04', '72138b23-2022-4e31-be38-453419477a8d', '7289235d-b1e1-4ea5-b4c3-12959aed62e9', '79cd82b8-4125-444c-bd92-c723f3e70071', '7d74001b-6942-49f3-8b46-947da4a3a8f5', '828966d8-1bba-43cb-9f67-48021e444068', '864e2490-a4ec-4aed-85e9-afebdfb087aa', '890fc4ab-11c9-4b7e-b2c6-19282ed09bdf', '8e5de836-8da8-4b27-a490-3fa82c2de8ef', '97df29a4-cfb5-45b0-97ba-02646fc89d09', '97df8184-d1a2-42d0-9b01-1cbc753c587c', 'a48c4b7d-158f-46ba-bd22-8f14544a4814', 'ac154f5c-3320-44f7-8b9d-c7b12d4977e4', 'ae46bc38-32f5-49ae-9862-ad5606eb1089', 'b71730fe-3a9b-4335-b85f-a5d0126c3887', 'bd39863e-67f4-48aa-9b4e-79167131e6ca', 'c169bdbf-6f09-454a-9cec-f1b9a22155f9', 'cb97bbeb-7686-417b-b93e-87e7d71f9259', 'e02d905a-6223-470d-bbbf-9fd65c7d1bba', 'e2fe3f82-f627-49b1-966e-de23412fbc11', 'ecd22398-5d0e-464e-8c9a-28136b8359f0', 'fabb1f68-0799-4470-af54-ae7c400294f7']",Robust image hashing with multidimensional scaling,Signal Processing,2017
675,"The measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series is typically corrupted by instrumental drift and physiological noise due to respiration and heartbeat giving rise to temporal correlation in the signals. Most methods proposed so far for nonparametric hemodynamic response function (HRF) estimation in fMRI data do not account for these confounding effects, and thus produce biased and inefficient estimates. The aim of this paper is to address this issue by modeling the noise in fMRI time series using an autoregressive model of order  p    (  AR(p)     A  R  (  p  )       ). Making use of a semiparametric model to characterize the fMRI time series and the   AR(p)     A  R  (  p  )        to model the temporally correlated noise, a generalized least squares (GLS) estimator for voxelwise consistent nonparametric HRF estimation is derived. The proposed estimation method is a three-stage procedure that relies on first-order differencing to remove drift and a novel structured covariance estimator for the AR noise based on Cholesky decomposition to derive the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the HRF. We also establish the asymptotic consistency of the proposed estimator. Simulation results show that the proposed method generates more accurate HRF estimates compared to existing methods. When applied to real fMRI data, it demonstrates the effectiveness in uncovering the brain response temporal dynamics for both event-related and block-design paradigms. Our approach removes the two types of noise in fMRI data simultaneously, thus providing efficient estimation of brain hemodynamic responses, while allowing for flexible characterization of the shape and timing of the voxelwise HRF.","['Abd-Krim Seghouane', 'Adnan Shah', 'Chee-Ming Ting']",d8a5201f-a2f7-4592-84b2-f3bd69195da8,0,"['49265eeb-53fc-4e0f-a523-64a6cd089f7d', '4d77a76b-0d39-4722-aa0e-da67ef266b41', '7b8a314c-7899-47cc-ac89-fc7fcd0679dd', '8a746885-5745-4d5a-81f8-2e49205f363b', 'aa2474dc-09c5-4ac6-b62d-51de238b2c88', 'b73db596-e270-42ac-b720-9aa6272a3126', 'bc284847-d2b2-48d7-b09d-873eecd6ae11', 'd665b0ac-5f1c-433a-a8a5-25d718a08d1d', 'dbb5cfad-e7a7-4a7c-ab09-be7296eff2be', 'e35c0037-4726-465d-b2c3-47bd14c25faa', 'f72694e8-39e4-4f87-90b7-e1ea2a9decb9', 'ff5594ed-3a94-44aa-afa6-3c698b3beb61']",fMRI Hemodynamic Response Function Estimation in Autoregressive Noise by Avoiding the Drift,Digital Signal Processing,2017
676,"Gamification has a clear influence on software design, development and plays an important role in the motivation and intention of users to use a website and buy online. Nevertheless, in the case of e-banking, the influence of gamification in software design and on the user's intention to use are still very unclear. We intend to verify how game design elements and mechanics combined in the design of a bank website, influence the intention of customers to use e-banking. To explore and analyze the effects of gamification on a bank website, we propose a conceptual model considering the interaction between six variables: gamification, ease of use, information, design, web page characteristics, and intention to use the website. To test this model we develop a quantitative study involving 219 bank customers as participants who interacted with a gamified e-banking website to manage their financial investments. Participants then responded to an online questionnaire (including items related to the main variables), in order to measure their reactions to gamified software and their intentions. All data were statistically analyzed and results indicate that gamification has a significant influence on the ease of use and the intention to use e-banking, as well as on the web design, information, and webpage characteristics. We find that gamification may motivate customers to use e-banking, and that it improves their financial literacy and facilitates online processes and transactions.

677,"Recently, high-performance mobile computer devices such as smart phones and tablet devices spread rapidly. They have attracted attention as a new promising platform for parallel and distributed applications. Based on the background, we are developing a cluster computer system using mobile devices or single board computers running Android OS. However, since mobile devices can move anywhere, node computers might leave from the cluster and new nodes might join the cluster. In this paper, we present an Android Cluster system that can reconfigure the system’s scale dynamically. Our system can automatically detect the change in the number of computation nodes and reconfigure the cluster’s nodes, even while parallel and distributed application is running. Furthermore, we show preliminary performance results of our system. The results show that our cluster provides the scalable performance to the number of nodes in parallel computation. Finally, it is confirmed that the mechanism of load balancing per process basis and the mechanism of switching to efficient data communication method can reduce the execution time of parallel applications. Our evaluation result shows that the execution time can be reduced up to 11.8% by load balancing per process basis, as compared to the load balancing per node basis, and shows that the execution time can be reduced 68% at maximum, by switching the communication method between processes to efficient one.","['Yuki Sawada', 'Yusuke Arai', 'Kanemitsu Ootsu', 'Takashi Yokota', 'Takeshi Ohkawa']",7514d46a-214a-4ece-8ae0-1accffa7aa83,0,"['031fca4c-e649-4248-8ac6-38db842dfb87', '158d79c5-21a9-4da2-8102-31cfe7e01ea3', '1bb1fd09-e7fb-42f2-8486-b3b0578fc3cc']",Performance of Android Cluster System Allowing Dynamic Node Reconfiguration,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
678,"Prognostics and health management (PHM) is widely applied to assess the reliability, safety and operation of systems particularly in spacecraft systems. However, spacecraft systems are very complex with intangibility and uncertainty, and it is difficult to model and analyze the complex degradation process, and thus there is no single prognostic method for solving the critical and complicated problem. This paper presents a novel hierarchical multi-class classification method using deep neural networks (DNN) and weighted support vector machine (WSVM) in order to achieve a highly discriminative feature representation for classifying the multimodal spacecraft data. First, the stack auto-Encoder (SAE) or deep belief network is adopted to initialize the initial weights and offsets of the hierarchical multi-layer neural network in order to reduce the dimension of the original multimodal data, and the optimal depth of multi-layer neural network and the discriminative features are also obtained. Second, in order to make the high dimensional spacecraft data more separable, the initialization parameters are online monitored by using a gradient descent method. Finally, a flexible hierarchical estimation method of a multi-class weighted support vector machines (MCWSVM) is applied to classify the multimodal spacecraft data. The performance of the proposed work is evaluated by the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and execution time, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed DNN with MCWSVM is efficient in terms of better classification accuracy at a lesser execution time when compared to K-nearest neighbors (KNN), SVM and naive Bayes method (NBM).","['Ke Li', 'Yalei Wu', 'Yu Nan', 'Pengfei Li', 'Yang Li']",8264496a-0961-4526-811b-b53b9f4513db,0,"['0295ded5-1ac1-41ef-b68f-7c622036479e', '13336963-1835-48ba-acec-77c933d7052d', '1f0bedf2-a6b2-4a1c-a1f9-895e54f760d8', '2825212d-c69e-44e3-9732-9bdc469d9279', '292affa8-105f-4ce0-95fd-b8826c4b29f0', '2938c3be-2d13-47a3-a1fe-8a72c15dacce', '2a9ff48e-4484-4cd6-985c-bda95fc598bd', '2f18813b-f2ba-431c-867d-bbe8e3eb90d2', '30c6705c-310b-48e4-a7af-c39ce5bd43da', '3c94ed85-3d8c-48ee-b5fb-b1580d535382', '430ab1cd-6287-40cd-aee7-274fad353489', '4f8ce322-d324-4670-8067-62161b24e4c7', '649279e5-dde4-4edd-b13b-aafbc4ff0f70', '69f6c0bf-9dc5-44ca-ab61-d71ab4c8832e', '810f7115-00c6-42b2-bf8c-142b2a35ed57', '89f10062-acf1-4171-b882-f3222c3a357e', '8e3135ba-f70f-416b-9617-5ab4b4821c7e', '96c5d21b-e0fa-4dbd-8f16-9650b6fa43d8', '96d6d9b9-6d69-4c9a-b3f5-c8083966d55c', '9ab99b2b-79fe-4ee0-a605-f61a1a011204', 'ab116822-2953-4a17-8409-07e6e8e53186', 'acdc4754-27f2-4dbf-a91c-7af48a42c4cb', 'bda74b99-b5f4-4041-829b-c1c2a31235f2', 'caaff64a-e3cb-4f06-a292-34994f34417c', 'cd949231-0d5f-4b1f-8aaa-752a198c2142', 'e29bd8a3-2f0f-4de9-9377-2b438ba22539', 'e7a60454-bb0e-4d8c-9f38-56fece2f1913', 'ed39f617-d941-48d3-b0bf-d17bafcd49ec']",Hierarchical multi-class classification in multimodal spacecraft data using DNN and weighted support vector machine,Neurocomputing,2017
679,"Various methods and techniques have been proposed in past for improving performance of queries on structured and unstructured data. The paper proposes a parallel B-Tree index in the MapReduce framework for improving efficiency of random reads over the existing approaches. The benefit of using the MapReduce framework is that it encapsulates the complexity of implementing parallelism and fault tolerance from users and presents these in a user friendly way. The proposed index reduces the number of data accesses for range queries and thus improves efficiency. The B-Tree index on MapReduce is implemented in a chained-MapReduce process that reduces intermediate data access time between successive map and reduce functions, and improves efficiency. Finally, five performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of proposed index for range search query in MapReduce, such as, varying cluster size and, size of range search query coverage on execution time, the number of map tasks and size of Input/Output (I/O) data. The effect of varying Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) block size and, analysis of the size of heap memory and intermediate data generated during map and reduce functions also shows the superiority of the proposed index. It is observed through experimental results that the parallel B-Tree index along with a chained-MapReduce environment performs better than default non-indexed dataset of the Hadoop and B-Tree like Global Index (Zhao et al., 2012) in MapReduce.","['Hari Singh', 'Seema Bawa']",5fdf64bb-3334-4930-9428-c48d89f2adbe,0,"['29820112-b2b6-4304-8058-1838e0a2643e', '300c9a42-a682-4fdc-b2a2-ac210a170a68', '3028bf0f-26d5-4275-9f03-038683080f39', '5002dd27-9ce6-4abb-a3d0-2ac112f58c37', '5757b5e3-a62b-411d-9b5d-705777d8bd35', '5aade45e-8b50-4cfe-8966-20b41cb698fa', '6175a7ae-1474-449a-bb4c-8e5c81f3d1e1', '66d033c4-7d3c-4e06-8d5e-f1841d4d5c3b', '70dfdec4-4c00-4097-a19c-b7424d306910', '7e6ddc6a-6dbf-4b4c-af32-5bbcc32dffb9', '7f69ed09-fcf4-42c3-a4eb-fbeb0f731112', '902e2658-9244-4111-b7e5-9697c74806a5', '9353a793-8815-4d33-9437-81884f4bc051', '9558f1d8-969d-41b4-bcff-d1d0faa61595', '96df9701-c10b-4d6b-8c85-54907cf1c0d6', 'aee2ef1c-2388-4da9-9221-b184dff29e4e', 'b003c72d-690b-49de-bd8d-d155f6acaa5f', 'b10cfac7-0d20-4c49-afe3-9ccfbe435ef9', 'b7adcdae-1933-457b-b226-9c0abcfcca41', 'bf3aa48f-04fc-4d4a-8820-2f9b260f4d51', 'c1f13d21-9542-4877-b2c3-28e364c68b0a', 'c363bc5a-64b0-4f41-82ce-ce89aac580ac', 'c5e9ece5-db9b-4914-a6e5-e9bf821f4dc7', 'd88f4bfe-042e-4d15-a2e3-de57c499b388', 'e8ba4ccd-81dc-4542-a5ca-f164cfb05d0b', 'e9430141-a2e3-47b4-b0f0-c4361ca0499c']",A MapReduce-based scalable discovery and indexing of structured big data,Future Generation Computer Systems,2017
680,"In unstructured wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which consist of a dense collection of sensor nodes deployed randomly, the communication and processing capabilities of sensor nodes can be limited owing to their small embedded batteries and available bandwidth. Power management is therefore one of the most important issues to consider in the implementation of WSNs. As a result, decentralized detection, in which the fusion center makes the final decision to use data partially processed by local nodes, is more attractive than centralized detection in unstructured WSNs. This paper proposes a more efficient and effective method for solving the power allocation problem as a constrained optimization problem: to schedule power allocation in a distributed WSN using correlated observations and amplify-and-forward local processing at sensor nodes so that the WSN detects a constant signal while maintaining a sufficient fusion error probability threshold. To accomplish this goal, this paper proposes using Deb’s method, which does not require a penalty parameter when handling the constraints of the optimization problem. Additionally, representative optimization algorithms based on swarm intelligence are used, i.e., particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization for continuous domains (\(\hbox {ACO},_{\mathbb {R},},\)), and artificial bee colony. Through a simulation, their performance is compared for several different WSNs to determine the best algorithm for solving the power allocation problem.",['Joonwoo Lee'],42d78b09-a733-4007-9794-3a74ee93120f,0,"['11d745d4-1d11-4f29-938c-938d28b809ed', '14dd092f-656e-40ce-a9d1-8332704f7e03', '284e03cf-c589-4cea-b8b1-9412708081b5', '293971a9-15e0-4a32-9c76-8a9704e304c2', '2c8142b2-1605-471d-877a-7fe0b3dffbf2', '3b2902a1-9128-42eb-a1a9-d95ec8ea701b', '5cd92b48-acc7-4822-a0f7-ba04a9c7b51e', '690d3071-d418-4b5a-89a1-8c8e98aa42e9', '6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3', '6c9166a8-e5bf-47a8-a3dd-29cd0b28d659', '8351f465-a4e2-4d9c-8782-3e780071aaab', 'a2a0d7ee-8fa9-46fe-9e0b-a2f3702e9af4', 'c281e71d-0b9b-44a6-8bb4-2635d55f9df6', 'cc58c216-c124-4d9b-b4b7-6273f7c27d58', 'd4ebfd72-1c9b-44ec-8bbd-af0766e91f13', 'e0d208ca-f58b-4180-b4a6-5a4b719cd53d', 'e47f4a17-8810-4db4-92fa-823711eeeb63', 'eb60926c-77ad-4bed-aa3c-d3bc3fb64a43', 'efc16f21-f739-4172-9fd8-c33106195726', 'f2b5eb54-b872-4cc6-92f0-49890e792199', 'f91ef229-19b7-4387-bff7-21f7448d7219']",Optimal power allocating for correlated data fusion in decentralized WSNs using algorithms based on swarm intelligence,Wireless Networks,2017
681,"Decompression sickness (DCS) is a disease caused by gas bubbles forming in body tissues following a reduction in ambient pressure, such as occurs in scuba diving. Probabilistic models for quantifying the risk of DCS are typically composed of a collection of independent, perfusion-limited theoretical tissue compartments which describe gas content or bubble volume within these compartments. It has been previously shown that ‘pharmacokinetic’ gas content models, with compartments coupled in series, show promise as predictors of the incidence of DCS. The mechanism of coupling can be through perfusion or diffusion. This work examines the application of five novel pharmacokinetic structures with compartments coupled by perfusion to the prediction of the probability and time of onset of DCS in humans. We optimize these models against a training set of human dive trial data consisting of 4335 exposures with 223 DCS cases. Further, we examine the extrapolation quality of the models on an additional set of human dive trial data consisting of 3140 exposures with 147 DCS cases. We find that pharmacokinetic models describe the incidence of DCS for single air bounce dives better than a single-compartment, perfusion-limited model. We further find the U.S. Navy LEM-NMRI98 is a better predictor of DCS risk for the entire training set than any of our pharmacokinetic models. However, one of the pharmacokinetic models we consider, the CS2T3 model, is a better predictor of DCS risk for single air bounce dives and oxygen decompression dives. Additionally, we find that LEM-NMRI98 outperforms CS2T3 on the extrapolation data.","['F. Gregory Murphy', 'Hada Ea', 'David J. Doolette', 'Laurens E.

682,"This article aims at analyzing the impact of implementing a product configuration system (PCS) on the increased accuracy of the cost calculations and the increased profitability of the products. Companies that have implemented PCSs have achieved substantial benefits in terms of being more in control of their product assortment, making the right decisions in the sales phase and increasing sales of optimal products. These benefits should have an impact on the company’s ability to make more accurate cost estimations in the sales phase, which can positively affect the products’ profitability. However, previous studies have not addressed this relationship to a great extent. For that reason, a configure-to-order (CTO) manufacturing company was analyzed. A longitudinal field study was performed in which the accuracy of the cost calculations and the products’ profitability were analyzed before and after a PCS was implemented. The comparison in the case study revealed that increased accuracy of the cost calculations in the sales phase and consequently increased profitability can be achieved by implementing a PCS.","['Anna Myrodia', 'Katrin Kristjansdottir', 'Lars Hvam']",482070c1-c868-4881-92fb-c56498b7db25,0,"['1640ee13-80e8-4a07-9b3a-dee91d3d42f3', '189b922b-20fb-4103-a932-b4d80e8a7172', '55579581-e4d7-49f4-8855-c294e182d633', '8325147e-8b8d-4708-814d-836cb0cbe082', 'a16b60ea-ad58-40ce-a21c-b3bb2f08a220', 'a77bf088-179a-40da-89e8-0e1f74e737d7', 'dbd81718-f87d-4f20-a106-bd835111b670', 'fa117f71-9cb6-47e4-adb3-2cb808bc05c2']",Impact of product configuration systems on product profitability and costing accuracy,Computers in Industry,2017
683,"Extracting biomedical entities and their relations from text has important applications on biomedical research. Previous work primarily utilized feature-based pipeline models to process this task. Many efforts need to be made on feature engineering when feature-based models are employed. Moreover, pipeline models may suffer error propagation and are not able to utilize the interactions between subtasks. Therefore, we propose a neural joint model to extract biomedical entities as well as their relations simultaneously, and it can alleviate the problems above. Our model was evaluated on two tasks, i.e., the task of extracting adverse drug events between drug and disease entities, and the task of extracting resident relations between bacteria and location entities. Compared with the state-of-the-art systems in these tasks, our model improved the F1 scores of the first task by 5.1% in entity recognition and 8.0% in relation extraction, and that of the second task by 9.2% in relation extraction. The proposed model achieves competitive performances with less work on feature engineering. We demonstrate that the model based on neural networks is effective for biomedical entity and relation extraction. In addition, parameter sharing is an alternative method for neural models to jointly process this task. Our work can facilitate the research on biomedical text mining.","['Fei Li', 'Meishan Zhang', 'Guohong Fu', 'Donghong Ji']",bd20bcb8-b540-4225-841d-96e17d176e5e,0,"['0057d416-7b31-47a5-bc49-c1c84a0da44c', '006bc093-ed6b-49bf-bca9-8d65b79a7b1e', '03ec40ae-43cc-4570-83aa-c32b70230257', '07e88ff8-8f96-45e7-97be-1583b238d49d', '09d58384-8518-4b89-a584-c14d6c19b4b4', '09ec02cf-f20b-4d05-bd84-2034f55112d5', '0eab0a8d-7e31-4687-a4f5-dfc90be76d1b', '15da2bd9-6a66-4af4-9d88-24e55cd9e229', '31751a06-95f4-4982-bcd1-36de239485a5', '3715c870-6569-4d20-8797-af8569e5fde5', '381ed64a-3ba1-43a0-b1ed-c24dbd696e54', '51f3382e-e4c9-475f-a9ba-aeda411c029b', '5cf21bc5-1d26-4705-9b59-0a6200928a9f', '6761a92a-2f9b-4689-8fa3-b913cfb326cd', '69d348cf-973b-44c7-9ede-a21a0480c888', '70345d11-ba46-4a0b-b2c8-c42b53adab6d', '720f97a2-f22c-4024-b5e9-1692d16412e6', '72edb3c4-d1a1-44bf-b70e-1fbce90f377d', '8506cd58-8b05-4f02-a6bb-369110d5c503', '893ae06a-87e4-4b4e-b0a0-c0e892c03cc4', '8aae68cd-14fe-4444-9a0b-735fe7255886', 'aa191ff5-5949-4ca5-b9a9-b26bed0b10e8', 'adee63a7-1b65-49e5-b727-6e2f2889404b', 'b08ad313-96d8-44d5-9760-837a543a388e', 'b689bade-e560-4be0-b0de-660fe153c4cb', 'b87ea21f-9553-4c45-b012-9589ebdab197', 'c9ed4689-da7e-4382-a8eb-a8487a85f9b5', 'ceed2e0c-d8cd-4d54-a4eb-3d62c6b26d8a', 'd074b3e6-83f9-4fbc-b6ba-392fd4829e72', 'd34584d4-44fd-4172-a54b-ec903cbe1584', 'd58cbe65-2411-4e55-b92e-67201b6e9c1d', 'def67193-6555-432c-b42f-c92cf5cb7ffd', 'e4164748-7827-424d-bc38-a50f7db080ae', 'eb57f2f6-f95f-4800-ab20-ab280f81ef2b']",A neural joint model for entity and relation extraction from biomedical text,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
684,"Face recognition from image sets has numerous real-life applications including recognition from security and surveillance systems, multi-view camera networks and personal albums. An image set is an unordered collection of images (e.g., video frames, images acquired over long term observations and personal albums) which exhibits a wide range of appearance variations. The main focus of the previously developed methods has therefore been to find a suitable representation to optimally model these variations. This paper argues that such a representation could not necessarily encode all of the information contained in the set. The paper, therefore, suggests a different approach which does not resort to a single representation of an image set. Instead, the images of the set are retained in their original form and an efficient classification strategy is developed which extends well-known simple binary classifiers for the task of multi-class image set classification. Unlike existing binary to multi-class extension strategies, which require multiple binary classifiers to be trained over a large number of images, the proposed approach is efficient since it trains only few binary classifiers on very few images. Extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods show that the proposed approach achieves state of the art performance for image set classification based face and object recognition on a number of challenging datasets.","['Munawar Hayat', 'Salman Hameed Khan', 'Mohammed Bennamoun']",079b4a01-458a-4de8-9b81-c1721acba1c4,0,"['01ec9388-a235-438e-85a2-416f057878f6', '061dcb4c-d98f-40a9-9c4a-aecb23fa078a', '06546bec-4d27-4ecf-a0ff-c96571dfec5f', '08a8ff17-204d-40d3-990e-62fa605467bb', '0cb270ef-ebc6-4a2c-bafd-4cd729ddc787', '15d53247-c854-4c9c-95ce-b8e5c066de34', '1bb39b41-b763-4648-b877-7c2ae6bdb0d7', '22ebb916-bab4-45ea-80b5-42bea948a7bf', '2e872d60-b156-4aea-ae48-d14b3c9cb167', '3218c05a-786f-4161-bc1f-290ba46c2f0c', '359c33e3-313b-4c2e-9ff9-5caacfd9ea31', '35b1ddab-817e-4ffa-ba0a-b94b7d76e7d9', '37031566-2033-44cb-a87e-91a9bb37996f', '3b23400e-aa6d-4ee3-b17c-82c04d98d157', '3b992dca-81b7-426e-8faf-3a3cd03572e0', '40d38cfa-21bc-40d6-a947-01d0e9d9908f', '493f502b-b1b8-412c-95fd-3c1103480f1d', '4a4b7055-350a-439b-ae66-68ba8154cc2f', '4cbd7765-c47a-4004-a5f8-c2da7c7d1c7b', '4fd03d6e-1754-49b0-b4d1-309668a670f8', '52f907d7-b2ce-4e34-8212-c54f1f0eec75', '5a7128e2-4298-44aa-9c39-31cbe9cd8d6e', '63807984-38a3-49ab-9e69-5add7e9690a7', '7102b1d7-679e-4503-82d3-028097d2ca43', '722927db-0a8d-43e1-bf5c-699515720e42', '770cd83d-2690-436c-8489-f3c602904404', '791b68f3-0bd8-43eb-b1fc-67698f601e48', '830450bd-b8f2-40fd-872f-e44a8e33bfd3', '8b8a2247-bd77-4736-b493-449734f56b9a', '8d2f6ae6-fdf7-4d4b-b596-36b11910ea83', '910a223b-1f53-4100-a600-6cce47c85f1d', '97e7da7b-f6f6-4927-9b6e-99edf4751e76', '9ec0d4e8-8b5d-476b-9b8f-137e09705d10', 'a1e0a9b2-f21d-47d5-a740-15f829153d89', 'a4b0349f-c3e5-4309-84e6-afed682e4143', 'a87e5134-ff93-484f-b13f-448f565e7fad', 'b1de2cc8-3f1b-4260-9c76-b26d1c702ee7', 'b79701df-f818-4edc-8e78-1b1ebef2d941', 'bf248c6c-2c05-4101-9a38-35460518f9d7', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'c892ced6-894d-4f54-b1e1-5612cbe7d1bb', 'cada56c7-5ba9-4e80-ac7c-988bc66ed6de', 'cf4a3510-35b2-42a2-bba4-894f15eacd14', 'd0563309-0497-4bad-8abe-79f96a19a617', 'd0c26ab4-fc4d-4eb1-aee3-022773c54d12', 'e0544d06-6066-4290-b92a-ba322257cd9c', 'e2204e92-e6dc-4884-9bbc-200029491fc7', 'e2f7a74a-8430-4463-94ce-fe85dfd309f9', 'e9d34f82-74ad-480f-89d3-1452cbf7be20', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6']",Empowering Simple Binary Classifiers for Image Set Based Face Recognition,International Journal of Computer Vision,2017
685,"Multi-class classification problems can be addressed by using decomposition strategy. One of the most popular decomposition techniques is the One-vs-One (OVO) strategy, which consists of dividing multi-class classification problems into as many as possible pairs of easier-to-solve binary sub-problems. To discuss the presence of classes with different cost, in this paper, we examine the behavior of an ensemble of Cost-Sensitive Back-Propagation Neural Networks (CSBPNN) with OVO binarization techniques for multi-class problems. To implement this, the original multi-class cost-sensitive problem is decomposed into as many sub-problems as possible pairs of classes and each sub-problem is learnt in an independent manner using CSBPNN. Then a combination method is used to aggregate the binary cost-sensitive classifiers. To verify the synergy of the binarization technique and CSBPNN for multi-class cost-sensitive problems, we carry out a thorough experimental study. Specifically, we first develop the study to check the effectiveness of the OVO strategy for multi-class cost-sensitive learning problems. Then, we develop a comparison of several well-known aggregation strategies in our scenario. Finally, we explore whether further improvement can be achieved by using the management of non-competent classifiers. The experimental study is performed with three types of cost matrices and proper statistical analysis is employed to extract the meaningful findings.","['Zhong-Liang Zhang', 'Xing-Gang Luo', 'Salvador García', 'Francisco Herrera']",cc0a6712-3d8c-4e10-80d1-fa6df03d62a5,0,"['01ec7aff-c4ea-4844-91fe-04e8009033bd', '0f908018-53db-408d-adb3-408c2a0b8cbc', '11887e48-ec02-4303-b681-23bba3c56282', '18cd45de-4a16-430b-97c9-0280f93447f8', '1ac8c203-9ce1-4419-907f-eabf515220f8', '2864d346-7936-411e-ab63-89ca26e68e9c', '29256780-b88c-483d-9e56-69ec63741886', '2d7fe689-6090-4e71-bc18-131ed46d5525', '2f69b7c5-d83b-4088-ba60-6503c67f9d48', '36ff7f92-b997-4843-8aff-ff82dffca4d6', '4ec29d6b-fb27-4bb1-8926-e70de71cbebe', '52c8b528-b197-4c7c-b936-684906f53b9c', '6311c293-aa3a-4441-bb11-e3b4418f6099', '859cb1a1-e5a9-400c-8bc7-0b707265fcaf', '8f41e2ee-85d2-4a2b-970c-272872b301d0', '8ff31792-42ac-43aa-b3cb-a2b1a52d44df', '9075487a-8183-4565-ac94-0197da31e056', 'a5e94b3b-1248-4063-883b-d2c0c7729e7b', 'a8e38db2-2dfd-470b-b8fa-beaf36f6cebf', 'aa767a83-de19-4421-bfb4-f63808992758', 'b2292ab0-98c2-4dbe-a132-5d528251a029', 'b322d531-6671-4a49-baee-669f070ebafb', 'b89566a9-a192-4aa4-8338-5dd99f394454', 'c57bf348-d1f3-4b34-bd88-d01e9946f2de', 'c6c6c335-5f34-4439-9ab9-5b8913f58586', 'ce6e3243-b71e-43bd-ace3-b99f2e278918', 'd46dd797-5e43-4cc4-87c1-3531621ae415', 'e4209f92-6f22-406c-9d10-10ebccb8bbc2', 'e5647db2-f367-4050-a0e9-46665ad4e1fd', 'e56d8d68-0feb-4420-8d47-2dddeec5d08a', 'e7116945-6723-4da8-85e3-80e7ef1b762e', 'e7a9e05d-c05b-4f0d-a820-1e8e9dedf9d2', 'ecf9323f-99a0-4202-983c-99204e5412a8', 'f630a9f5-8c54-4f28-9a80-026974f48600', 'f6d414e2-c137-43dc-843e-aea0c9d4eb11']",Cost-Sensitive back-propagation neural networks with binarization techniques in addressing multi-class problems and non-competent classifiers,Applied Soft Computing,2017

687,"Learning effective relevance measures plays a crucial role in improving the performance of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Despite extensive research efforts for decades, how to discover and incorporate semantic information of images still poses a formidable challenge to real-world CBIR systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid textual-visual relevance learning method, which mines textual relevance from image tags and combines textual relevance and visual relevance for CBIR. To alleviate the sparsity and unreliability of tags, we first perform tag completion to fill the missing tags as well as correct noisy tags of images. Then, we capture users’ semantic cognition to images by representing each image as a probability distribution over the permutations of tags. Finally, instead of early fusion, a ranking aggregation strategy is adopted to sew up textual relevance and visual relevance seamlessly. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets well verified the promise of our approach.","['Chaoran Cui', 'Peiguang Lin', 'Xiushan Nie', 'Yilong Yin', 'Qingfeng Zhu']",147a311e-5f91-4164-986a-cc0962983b09,0,"['0d580cd2-341b-4bd1-b2fc-7cb1d9b721da', '104e96e0-906b-459d-a4e4-e0ff1b5705b2', '10dc987f-bdce-48dd-b4a5-d036387ed1ce', '12b8a509-4e1d-4373-a883-a93771ef967b', '14ae7409-fe15-4635-9548-3860b0643901', '1fd20325-58fc-4947-b381-f5f126183379', '2b4911ca-d61d-43b9-b527-7af1b67d0054', '2c4c35f1-3777-4606-b5d2-3a8383ab0df9', '2e6abbcc-e5f7-4d66-8d19-d74f1e7f9cc7', '30d8f379-03fa-468d-9041-4e153faf087e', '30da015e-fc53-4de5-91b8-18e28f1281d2', '35214339-66a1-4f0f-aecf-eb574190454b', '39cf1186-c0e0-4b9e-8477-09b89c250488', '3d53e087-f9d2-4d67-ac6f-2be0b36ad2a2', '432cca1f-bfbf-47a5-90fc-3cfd00bca630', '47be13e3-8eb5-4a1a-8720-90a913da4173', '4cc790a6-5d16-4d7f-ac28-625a2a8eaca4', '4d22a47f-a0c8-4bc2-8afc-e89c71ab720f', '4ea99a52-c2f7-4d6a-a2a8-6e6c5bdb1d95', '51667250-5e75-4c49-b63e-04abf461baa4', '5635786c-5e0d-4be0-9261-b04dfa0e6643', '57faca92-1a32-45de-8397-1ae103d80445', '59f95429-0ca7-4201-96e6-fcbda59fbeec', '5c3bca94-0f83-42fd-8b03-a032e1eb3999', '5dca91b1-5167-49c5-866f-83de92ff5362', '5f730c75-c986-495e-9708-cfedcd028617', '6178fe43-369d-4bcd-b97b-66cc00f68e2c', '638ae38d-2880-4c40-8bfc-86510ec17c96', '6ab9cf91-e427-4432-87fa-04771a91788c', '7493ca82-8397-44fa-b752-0a780225981e', '7a163786-53d1-47a5-89fc-b1795140e442', '7b597fb8-8ceb-4150-90e6-c21c913b55b9', '8408ccfb-71d7-4827-bd6c-de6502d219c2', '987f0e8c-43ec-4b04-9c3e-0eef6cdd1265', '9d804773-d0d5-4f01-94b1-8a98d5468727', '9f79053a-28e0-4a34-892a-f3fcecfb65ee', 'a648a38c-3003-4ba0-8c31-ee77b834fcae', 'b3cf3b08-645a-45ae-b908-e6b205ebb413', 'c8f294f4-4cb8-4daf-a850-8f1f105e0c5d', 'cde8a98a-debf-4bb3-98b8-9e556fe78442', 'e3a1658d-bcfe-4580-b652-830cabfbb881', 'f1b15c34-09ec-4413-87a2-23da9fe9e61e']",Hybrid textual-visual relevance learning for content-based image retrieval ☆,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017

By using Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method, some new sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of (1) the smallest possible outer bound of forwards reachable sets; and (2) the largest possible inter bound of backward reachable sets. These conditions are delay dependent and in the form of linear matrix inequalities, which therefore can be efficiently solved by using existing convex algorithms. A constructive geometric design of switching laws is also presented.

689,"The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the de facto standard international classification for mortality reporting and for many epidemiological, clinical, and financial use cases. The next version of ICD, ICD-11, will be submitted for approval by the World Health Assembly in 2018. Unlike previous versions of ICD, where coders mostly select single codes from pre-enumerated disease and disorder codes, ICD-11 coding will allow extensive use of multiple codes to give more detailed disease descriptions. For example, “severe malignant neoplasms of left breast” may be coded using the combination of a “stem code” (e.g., code for malignant neoplasms of breast) with a variety of “extension codes” (e.g., codes for laterality and severity). The use of multiple codes (a process called post-coordination), while avoiding the pitfall of having to pre-enumerate vast number of possible disease and qualifier combinations, risks the creation of meaningless expressions that combine stem codes with inappropriate qualifiers. To prevent that from happening, “sanctioning rules” that define legal combinations are necessary. In this work, we developed a crowdsourcing method for obtaining sanctioning rules for the post-coordination of concepts in ICD-11. Our method utilized the hierarchical structures in the domain to improve the accuracy of the sanctioning rules and to lower the crowdsourcing cost. We used Bayesian networks to model crowd workers’ skills, the accuracy of their responses, and our confidence in the acquired sanctioning rules. We applied reinforcement learning to develop an agent that constantly adjusted the confidence cutoffs during the crowdsourcing process to maximize the overall quality of sanctioning rules under a fixed budget. Finally, we performed formative evaluations using a skin-disease branch of the draft ICD-11 and demonstrated that the crowd-sourced sanctioning rules replicated those defined by an expert dermatologist with high precision and recall.

690,"The preparation of probability distribution maps is the first important step in risk assessment and wildfire management. Here we employed Weights-of-Evidence (WOE) Bayesian modeling to investigate the spatial relationship between historical fire events in the Chaharmahal-Bakhtiari Province of Iran, using a wide range of binary predictor variables (i.e., presence or absence of a variable characteristic or condition) that represent topography, climate, and human activities. Model results were used to produce distribution maps of wildfire probability. Our modeling approach is based on the assumption that the probabilities reflect the observed proportions of the total landscape area occupied by the corresponding events (i.e., fire incident or no fire) and conditions (i.e., classes) of predictor variables. To assess the effect of each predictor variable on model outputs, we excluded each variable in turn during calculations. The results were validated and compared by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) using both success rate and prediction rate curves. Seventy percent of fire events were used for the former, while the remainder was used for the latter. The validation results showed that the area under the curves (AUC) for success and prediction rates of the model that included all thirteen predictor variables that represent topography, climate, and human influences were 84.6 and 80.4%, respectively. The highest AUC for success and prediction rates (86.8 and 84.6%) were achieved when the altitude variable was excluded from the analysis. We found slightly decreased AUC values when the slope-aspect and proximity to settlements variables were excluded. These findings clearly demonstrate that the probability of a fire is strongly dependent upon the topographic characteristics of landscapes and, perhaps more importantly, human infrastructure and associated human activities. The results from this study may be useful for land use planning, decision-making for wildfire management, and the allocation of fire resources prior to the start of the main fire season.","['Abolfazl Jaafari', 'Davood Mafi Gholami', 'Eric K.

692,"Abstract This contribution studies the technological capabilities of Central and Eastern European (CEE) economies based on priority filings for the period of 1980–2009. From a global perspective, the indicators suggest a division of labour in technological activities among world regions whereby Europe, Latin America and the former USSR are specializing in sectors losing technological dynamism (Chemicals and Mechanical Engineering) while North America, the Middle East (especially Israel) and Asia Pacific are increasingly specializing in Electrical Engineering, a sector with significant technological opportunities. Regarding priority filings, CEE reduced its technological activities drastically after 1990. The recovery of CEE economies regarding technological capabilities is unfolding very slowly. The results speak for the ability of CEE countries in contributing to a limited number of fields with growing technological opportunities. The technological profile of the CEE region will more likely than not complicate the technology upgrading process towards activities at the technological frontier.","['Iciar Dominguez Lacasa', 'Alexander Giebler', 'Slavo Radosevic']",be7f00ea-fb80-48c8-961d-e8bb9c5e88d4,0,"['06be599a-fea7-4853-9b35-67aa4627aafb', '142a089b-7e54-48a5-8bf9-6a6553ece439', '1ce96b62-4820-4246-b276-672188c4741d', '6df672ce-352e-4dce-9db6-11249ecf11ff']",Technological capabilities in Central and Eastern Europe: an analysis based on priority patents,Scientometrics,2017

694,"Electronic medical records (EMRs) are being increasingly used for “risk” prediction. By “risks,” we denote outcomes such as emergency presentation, readmission, and the length of hospitalizations. However, EMR data analysis is complicated by missing entries. There are two reasons—the “primary reason for admission” is included in EMR, but the comorbidities (other chronic diseases) are left uncoded, and many zero values in the data are accurate, reflecting that a patient has not accessed medical facilities. A key challenge is to deal with the peculiarities of this data—unlike many other datasets, EMR is sparse, reflecting the fact that patients have some but not all diseases. We propose a novel model to fill-in these missing values and use the new representation for prediction of key hospital events. To “fill-in” missing values, we represent the feature-patient matrix as a product of two low-rank factors, preserving the sparsity property in the product. Intuitively, the product regularization allows sparse imputation of patient conditions reflecting common comorbidities across patients. We develop a scalable optimization algorithm based on Block coordinate descent method to find an optimal solution. We evaluate the proposed framework on two real-world EMR cohorts: Cancer (7000 admissions) and Acute Myocardial Infarction (2652 admissions). Our result shows that the AUC for 3-month emergency presentation prediction is improved significantly from (0.729 to 0.741) for Cancer data and (0.699 to 0.723) for AMI data. Similarly, AUC for 3-month emergency admission prediction from (0.730 to 0.752) for Cancer data and (0.682 to 0.724) for AMI data. We also extend the proposed method to a supervised model for predicting multiple related risk outcomes (e.g., emergency presentations and admissions in hospital over 3, 6, and 12 months period) in an integrated framework. The supervised model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.","['Budhaditya Saha', 'Sunil Gupta', 'Dinh Q.

695,"People undertake various brand-related activities on social media that differ in levels of engagement. Companies, however, want to know how to motivate consumers to become involved in the relatively more engaging activities, as such activities are more likely to lead to increased sales. In this article, we focus on activities that are highly engaging (such as writing product reviews) or moderately engaging (such as rating products). Based on self-determination theory, the present research identifies different motivations for engaging in different brand-related activities on social media. We provide evidence indicating that the motivations of self-expression and socializing play primary roles in leading people to participate in highly engaging activities (i.e. creating one’s own content online) and in moderately engaging activities (i.e. collaborating with others to contribute to content). These findings have implications for both theory and practice insofar as they specify how to stimulate consumers to perform relatively more engaging brand-related activities on social media.","['Lisette de Vries', 'Alessandro M.

697,"Segmentation is one of the crucial steps for the computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of skin cancer with dermoscopy images. To accurately extract lesion borders from dermoscopy images, a novel automatic segmentation algorithm using saliency combined with Otsu threshold is proposed in this paper, which includes enhancement and segmentation stages. In the enhancement stage, prior information on healthy skin is extracted, and the color saliency map and brightness saliency map are constructed respectively. By fusing the two saliency maps, the final enhanced image is obtained. In the segmentation stage, according to the histogram distribution of the enhanced image, an optimization function is designed to adjust the traditional Otsu threshold method to obtain more accurate lesion borders. The proposed model is validated from enhancement effectiveness and segmentation accuracy.

698,"Abstract  Objective  The aim of this study was to propose features that evaluate pictorial differences between melanocytic nevus (mole) and melanoma lesions by computer-based analysis of plain photography images and to design a cross-platform, tunable, decision support system to discriminate with high accuracy moles from melanomas in different publicly available image databases.  Material and Methods  Digital plain photography images of verified mole and melanoma lesions were downloaded from (i) Edinburgh University Hospital, UK, (Dermofit, 330 moles/70 melanomas, under signed agreement), from 5 different centers (Multicenter, 63 moles/25 melanomas, publicly available), and from the Groningen University, Netherlands (Groningen, 100 moles/70 melanomas, publicly available). Images were processed for outlining the lesion-border and isolating the lesion from the surrounding background. Fourteen features were generated from each lesion evaluating texture (4), structure (5), shape (4) and color (1). Features were subjected to statistical analysis for determining differences in pictorial properties between moles and melanomas. The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifier, the exhaustive search features selection, the leave-one-out (LOO), and the external cross-validation (ECV) methods were used to design the PR-system for discriminating between moles and melanomas.  Results  Statistical analysis revealed that melanomas as compared to moles were of lower intensity, of less homogenous surface, had more dark pixels with intensities spanning larger spectra of gray-values, contained more objects of different sizes and gray-levels, had more asymmetrical shapes and irregular outlines, had abrupt intensity transitions from lesion to background tissue, and had more distinct colors. The PR-system designed by the Dermofit images scored on the Dermofit images, using the ECV, 94.1%, 82.9%, 96.5% for overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, on the Multicenter Images 92.0%, 88%, 93.7% and on the Groningen Images 76.2%, 73.9%, 77.8% respectively.  Conclusion  The PR-system as designed by the Dermofit image database could be fine-tuned to classify with good accuracy plain photography moles/melanomas images of other databases employing different image capturing equipment and protocols.","['Spiros A.

700,"We present a first formal analysis of specific and complete local integration. Complete local integration was previously proposed as a criterion for detecting entities or wholes in distributed dynamical systems. Such entities in turn were conceived to form the basis of a theory of emergence of agents within dynamical systems. Here, we give a more thorough account of the underlying formal measures. The main contribution is the disintegration theorem which reveals a special role of completely locally integrated patterns (what we call ι-entities) within the trajectories they occur in.

Furthermore, we construct the least upper bound and provide a candidate for the greatest lower bound of specific local integration.

701,"A revenue-maximizing monopolist is selling a single indivisible good to buyers who face a loss if any of its rival buyers obtain it. The rivalry is modeled through a network, an arc between a pair of buyers indicates that a buyer considers another buyer its rival, and the magnitude of the loss is the private information of each buyer. This loss-exposure due to competitive considerations can be viewed as a negative externality. First, using a Myersonian approach we derive the monopolist’s optimal mechanism for any given network. Second, we show that revenues depend on the network structure. Thus, in applications where it is possible, the monopolist might consider designing not only the mechanism but also the network (if not fully, at least partially). Third, we provide and fully describe the solution to the monopolist’s market design problem; that is, the joint network and mechanism design problem. Specifically, despite the nonmonotone impact of additional competition on the monopolist’s revenues, we deter...","['A.

702,"Software watermarking is a defence technique used to prevent software piracy by embedding a signature, i.e., an identifier reliably representing the owner, in the code. When an illegal copy is made, the ownership can be claimed by extracting this identifier. The signature has to be hidden inside the program and it has to be difficult for an attacker to detect, tamper or remove it. In this paper we show how the ability of the attacker to identify the signature can be modelled in the framework of abstract interpretation as a completeness property. We view attackers as abstract interpreters that can precisely observe only the properties for which they are complete. In this setting, hiding a signature in the code corresponds to inserting it in terms of a semantic property that can be retrieved only by attackers that are complete for it. Indeed, any abstract interpreter that is not complete for the property specifying the signature cannot detect, tamper or remove it. The goal of this work is to introduce a formal framework for the modelling, at a semantic level, of software watermarking techniques and their quality features.","['Mila Dalla Preda', 'Michele Pasqua']",ac203904-efcc-4c0f-8cf0-240f4c877c01,0,"['05fefbba-b84c-470a-9865-65403d4165f4', '13319371-cf85-4369-9d5a-df7b4d67e892', '173c7986-a6b4-49d6-82f5-b874d23f0955', '1b5bab9a-7b15-4d2b-9690-fe7ea9469e07', '577155bc-1086-432b-968d-c72800914ea2', '635e2014-6579-4acf-9737-49593bc74701', '6d0e89c7-dde0-4e23-bf72-903365210d8c', '715f42bb-6ff9-4a93-8869-7b2c09657251', '793a919a-eed2-4385-a63f-f6950a53ea15', '9a4984f9-27d4-47eb-8bc8-0469bf540f94', 'cc98aeb3-e9cc-46ba-b4bf-9b957f633183', 'ef4a6cf6-1255-406c-a76f-a3b07cb7f56c']",Software Watermarking: A Semantics-based Approach,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2017
703,"A new frontier of assistive devices aims at designing exoskeletons based on fabric and flexible materials for applications where kinematic transparency is the primary requirement. Bowden-cable transmission is the widely employed solution in most of the aforementioned applications due to advantages in durability, lightweight, safety, and flexibility. The major advantages of soft assistive devices driven by bowden-cable transmissions can be identified in the superior ergonomics and wearability, allowing users to freely move and allocating the actuation stages far from the end-effector. However, control accuracy in bowden-cable transmission presents some intrinsic limitation due to nonlinearities such as static and dynamic friction, occurring between the cables and the bowden sheaths, and backlash hysteresis. Friction and backlash effects are known to be related to the curvature of the flexible sheath, which is not directly measurable and can vary during human motion. In this paper we describe our new wearable exosuit for upper limb assistance and in particular we introduce a mathematical model for backlash hysteresis compensation. The implementation of a nonlinear adaptive controller is described in detail and experimentally tested on the proposed design as a backlash compensation strategy: results report that the adaptive controller improves the accuracy in position tracking (i.e. RMSERMSE in trajectory tracking ≈1∘≈1∘) by compensating for time-varying backlash and continuously updating the model parameters. The backlash hysteresis model and the proposed control scheme are validated first on a custom-designed test bench and then applied to control the soft exoskeleton worn by a subject affected by bilateral brachial plexus injury.","['Binh Khanh Dinh', 'Michele Xiloyannis', 'Leonardo Cappello', 'Chris Wilson Antuvan', 'Shih-Cheng Yen', 'Lorenzo Masia']",ca51ac4f-f621-40e9-8544-0cb7c7c3d13c,0,"['08db2348-b608-42f3-b65e-75a2605959ea', '19805ee0-7d86-4534-9dce-0da9902223bf', '1d1bd7c1-8a72-447e-b31c-3f8dc611c1cb', '55c69505-f24d-402e-9f00-33d4b0c79823', '5b15f439-4cc9-45eb-b028-1522db6d51af', '5df114fb-065f-49ef-9b31-b6b3f90aea34', '7efba1f1-b6fd-40ff-a1f0-3e787063ab64', '95dfadda-d204-496e-a135-f514cd021219', 'a38864ad-c64b-45b8-81a9-4cb7878ac2ee', 'ba536cc4-fbdc-491b-939d-0454bcb71bd5', 'bf825495-0b02-42cd-ab90-79ee42828787', 'c18fa47b-8013-4b41-a5e4-f181099db181', 'c98f4334-50b8-49e4-a186-c4fef3407bbc', 'd5050764-b526-4df0-8823-424101a93306', 'ea8ed0d8-ece8-4558-baaf-71c2a37a0f76']",Adaptive backlash compensation in upper limb soft wearable exoskeletons,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2017

From a government perspective they are also strategic stakeholders of information products and services, which government agencies deliver to school communities in order to achieve higher levels of quality and equity in education. In the context of user-centered ICT developments, public organizations find online surveys to be a reliable and cost effective means for gathering information on the needs and perceptions of its citizens. This study aims to understand the influence of email scheduling on the response rate and response time for an online survey, focusing on a representative sample of 1000 school principals at public and private schools in Chile. It also adds an exploratory inquiry (n = 100) into embedding a survey in an email, as opposed to sending it via a link. In line with previous research, the findings reveal the non-significant effect of weekday and daytime emails on response rate and response time. They also reveal that a reminder message can have a significant effect on response rate and that there was no difference in response rate between surveys embedded in an email and surveys sent via a link. Significant differences are found in the response rate and response time between urban and rural schools. The implications for bridging the information gap in online consultations are discussed.","['Leonardo Andres Madariaga', 'Miguel Nussbaum', 'Isabelle Burq', 'Faustino Marañón', 'Daniel Salazar', 'Luis Maldonado', 'Cristóbal Moreno Alarcón', 'María Naranjo']",973686b7-16f1-4742-8ccf-99fae0645f0d,0,"['0b7bfa65-af17-4671-b56b-92b43ab6ef97', '3fef8d84-6d98-4829-a75a-ab4d18b9c61d', '4058b308-3592-4314-8ff6-9d0ce6672eef', '5003af9c-bb39-4baa-a909-33b902401fa7', '62b3810d-db34-447f-adaf-1e5bba676372', '6d5f2f9e-ba00-4c01-a233-6e5d1326267e', '73cb42df-b158-4d21-85e8-e7cacb86a9bc', '7a06f3ce-02e4-4f2e-b26c-2bb5200a6e36', '99fdeb0c-0d4b-4776-94f2-5243536d36f1', 'a4564862-9d0c-40e4-b4bf-721c4d77242b', 'aadec6e7-8706-4a5c-a85c-adeb1c2147b6', 'b7878bcf-f42a-4050-afac-f94fd959a375', 'd984f562-b529-44d2-b27c-3c209c1d0a5d']",Online survey: A national study with school principals,Computers in Human Behavior,2017

707,"Effective categorization of the millions of aerial images from unmanned planes is a useful technique with several important applications. Previous methods on this task usually encountered such problems: (1) it is hard to represent the aerial images’ topologies efficiently, which are the key feature to distinguish the arial images rather than conventional appearance, and (2) the computational load is usually too high to build a realtime image categorization system. Addressing these problems, this paper proposes an efficient and effective aerial image categorization method based on a contextual topological codebook. The codebook of aerial images is learned with a multitask learning framework. The topology of each aerial image is represented with the region adjacency graph (RAG). Furthermore, a codebook containing topologies is learned by jointly modeling the contextual information, based on the extracted discriminative graphlets. These graphlets are integrated into a Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation for predicting aerial image categories. Contextual relation among local patches are taken into account in categorization to yield high categorization performance. Experimental results show that our approach is both effective and efficient.","['Zhijun Meng', 'Yan Wang', 'Xinyu Wu', 'Yating Yin', 'Teng Li']",6606fd66-b97a-4802-bc97-bf6c89283349,0,"['100a5357-5ee0-4f40-984a-d708229315d6', '1a291952-11c1-4415-9752-2ba6617171b5', '1ca38791-fd1e-4428-98a2-43856a4306a3', '26316adf-569e-49bc-a289-c1ba311624f6', '2ea9e12f-efb2-437f-b037-3acd9f3c6deb', '367c86a5-13a3-44b2-9732-9fea4848f264', '36b0e41f-9676-47a0-bd10-ec08b3884772', '3b87ada8-4b3d-4a5e-8a02-4561f816ff3e', '3dedfe96-bf8c-47fb-ad4e-075e54b48ec6', '42563120-0f32-4bb8-b10f-6e9a6c4f00ab', '4b9c17d1-9a08-48a2-95e0-47d3d4452a96', '5b5c6cba-ed45-4649-aceb-499f1b7dc5cb', '6692d3e1-f6a0-48c0-8733-7b1f72587fd0', '6b0fceab-aa89-41d1-a12b-7fa47fc69b88', '6c38b3b4-7562-493d-a40c-fe70abf039a7', '7cdd68ef-876b-4214-bd85-38dd01ac99c9', '81d6c2f8-26e9-40ed-ac2a-3ead6a271295', '893c5c69-c7c7-4aad-a03c-560e899940ce', '8de9f75d-5ea6-4be6-9cc8-21e1a326c817', '9175053a-0887-4de2-9244-2f3235914017', '96e6e379-df16-4a2f-8ba8-f2141b30f001', '98916c1f-4030-4ac0-a186-2e2e60188701', '9aea2ad1-64c1-4e32-b991-1333e5b60a13', '9d82c8dd-bab3-42bc-ba0f-d0c4e0c6cdeb', 'c87ccd2c-b3f2-4533-a039-b28c70851a59', 'd420b434-26c6-4c2d-88bc-6e10d44149e7', 'd4a45f7c-d5b8-4968-bc4d-3291a258fa07', 'dabef33b-b466-426a-9e5c-0ad6ee819bd6', 'e0ac4812-7729-4a2d-8a1f-74b1b7c8eb5d', 'e79d3bed-e506-462c-bd86-504e94dfad33', 'f4d140eb-8c47-4d0a-87d5-ad917e8c5d26', 'f592195b-ced2-408d-a5c0-86a57aba9947', 'f6578d91-30cc-4c79-8d53-92041fa9b95b', 'fb88c17b-d2bb-47ef-aff6-eb04f100b457']",Contextual aerial image categorization using codebook,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017
708,"Information spreading is often analyzed comparatively on small-world and random networks. Topological differences between small-world networks and random networks are believed to be main reasons that lead to various different spreading behaviours on these two types of networks. Besides those differences, the heterogeneity of spreading abilities of network ties is often overlooked. In this study, we analyze the impacts of the heterogeneity on information spreading over small-world networks and random networks. Through simulations on both artificial and realistic networks, we find that the strong heterogeneity leads to lower efficiency of spreading over small-world networks. The heterogeneity not only slows down the spreading pace, but also lengthens the life span of the information spread over small-world networks. Under such strong heterogeneity, random networks, which are affected little, are better for information spreading. However, as the heterogeneity decreases, small-world networks finally exceed random networks when regarding information spreading. We also conduct experiments to review the weak ties assumption in small-world networks. We find that the heterogeneity forces information to bypass weak ties and travels along strongly connected nodes.","['Chengeng Ou', 'Xiaolong Jin', 'Yuanzhuo Wang', 'Xueqi Cheng']",26eda535-af52-48b6-94fd-d3ca2bdea56d,0,"['0be5f1b9-3895-4592-b24d-d667047e3a4c', '24dedf25-aea6-4da5-8475-13b19c690a77', '29974572-73f0-45bf-a23d-c54b308cec5f', '2ec46b47-6b16-4659-aa88-2082ac7ebc97', '33824d44-b5fd-4134-b89d-b3af25d2828d', '3577aea8-e56f-4a23-8d9f-d1ba623e8019', '38699cb5-4466-47b5-bc20-24a84848acbd', '39c17ca4-27eb-498a-9e5f-606fcaa8a6cf', '456d4837-f250-4e98-839c-c81dded12804', '556effa9-58de-41f6-8943-e078a5a17929', '8c73e922-7ce0-4bcc-bd64-3a8f273b4fe6', '95d9f950-34c1-47ea-95a8-af11915625c6', '9605bba5-e72f-4ee1-bdaf-f866a1cd8565', 'a6645ecc-38ab-45da-a369-ff6d75e9199d', 'dd6b15ee-6010-4991-be6b-54fd0d4dc2a0']",Modelling heterogeneous information spreading abilities of social network ties,Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory,2017
709,"Land-cover change, a major driver of the distribution and functioning of ecosystems, is characterized by a high diversity of patterns of change across space and time. Thus, a large amount of information is necessary to analyse change and develop plans for proper management of natural resources. In this work we tested MaxEnt algorithm in a completely remote land-cover classification and change analysis. In order to provide an empirical example, we selected Italian southern Alps as test region. We classified two Landsat images (1976 and 2001) in order to forecast probability of occurrence for unsampled locations and determining the best subset of predictors (spectral bands). A difference map for each land cover class, representing the difference between 1976 and 2001 probability of occurrence values, was realised. In order to better address the analysis of change patterns, we put together difference maps and topographic variables, since, in the study area, they are considered as the main environmental characteristic driving the land-use change topographic variables, in connection with climate change. Our results indicate that the selected algorithm, applied to land cover classes, can provide reliable data, especially when referring to classes with homogeneous texture properties and surface reflectance. The performed models had satisfactory predictive performance, showing relatively clear patterns of difference between the two time steps considered. The development of a methodology that, in the absence of field data, allow to obtain data on land use change dynamics, is of extreme importance for land planning and management.","['Valerio Amici', 'Matteo Marcantonio', 'Nicola La Porta', 'Duccio Rocchini']",5440ae9a-e448-4f67-9e03-eb0049aad22f,0,"['003b501f-bfc4-4ed8-8896-24ab0ad5b12d', '01e05960-cbf1-423e-b6fa-4c0487614cbe', '1f20bf25-de57-4fb9-83aa-2b4790e0c386', '57bd2acc-4969-42db-9701-71f7c17e8902', '5b699cea-3bef-4e4e-9541-28333449164c', '897ea81a-48a8-41d6-9a67-2d404750c000', 'db424069-9b03-4551-ba3d-d4aeeec8b4d4']",A multi-temporal approach in MaxEnt modelling: A new frontier for land use/land cover change detection,Ecological Informatics,2017
710,"The inherent riskiness of large-scale information technology (IT) outsourcing led us to investigate what motivates large-scale IT outsourcing decisions. We employed fixed-effects logistical regressions to examine publicly available data for 51 firms that announced their decisions to outsource all or a large portion of their IT function during the 1993-2001 period. Results suggest that incentives created by CEO stock options and overall compensation mix significantly influence decisions to outsource. We thus provide the first evidence of a relationship between managerial self-interest and IT outsourcing. Additional results suggest that poor overall firm performance, poor cost control, and short-term cash needs also drive large-scale IT outsourcing, but provide no evidence that firms outsource IT to reduce leverage.

711,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators which bind to target to regulate protein expression by repressing translation or promoting degradation of the target mRNA. Studies have shown that deep sequencing is a powerful tool for the identification of miRNAs, and it is believed that may more miRNAs remain to be discovered in grass carp. In the present study, a pool of equal amounts of RNA obtained from 8 different adult grass carp tissues (spleen, liver, muscle, kidney, skin, testis, gut and heart) was sequenced using deep sequencing technology. A total of 16.579.334 raw reads were yielded from the pooled small RNA library. Using bioinformatics analysis, we identified 160 conserved miRNAs and 18 novel miRNAs in grass carp. Randomly selected 6 conserved and 2 novel miRNAs were confirmed their expression by stem-loop qRT-PCR assay. Furthermore, the 1212 potential targets of these miRNAs were predicted using miRNA target prediction tool. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses indicated relevant biological processes. Our study provides the first genome-wide investigation of miRNAs from 8 mixed tissues of grass carp, and the data obtained expand the known grass carp miRNA inventory and provide a basis for further understanding functions of grass carp miRNAs.","['Wangbao Gong', 'Yong Huang', 'Jun Xie', 'Guangjun Wang', 'Deguang Yu', 'Xihong Sun']",c4815b30-7e22-4369-9133-a34aa206fa41,0,['05d7ece9-f743-4a9a-ac7b-2a250d14ac34'],Genome-wide identification and characterization of conserved and novel microRNAs in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) by deep sequencing,Computational Biology and Chemistry,2017
712,"Abstract  Background  Since the 1990s many hospitals in the OECD countries have introduced electronic health record (EHR) systems. A number of studies have examined the factors impinging on EHR implementation. Others have studied the clinical efficacy of EHR. However, only few studies have explored the (intermediary) factors that make EHR systems conducive to quality management (QM).  Objective  Undertake a narrative review of existing studies in order to identify and discuss the factors conducive to making EHR support three dimensions of QM: clinical outcomes, managerial monitoring and cost-effectiveness.  Method  A narrative review of Web of Science, Cochrane, EBSCO, ProQuest, Scopus and three Nordic research databases. Limitation: most studies do not specify the type of EHR examined.  Results  39 studies were identified for analysis. 10 factors were found to be conducive to make EHR support QM. However, the contribution of EHR to the three specific dimensions of QM varied substantially. Most studies (29) included clinical outcomes. However, only half of these reported EHR to have a positive impact. Almost all the studies (36) dealt with the ability of EHR to enhance managerial monitoring of clinical activities, the far majority of which showed a positive relationship. Finally, only five dealt with cost-effectiveness of which two found positive effects.  Discussion and conclusion  The findings resonates well with previous reviews, though two factors making EHR support QM seem new, namely: political goals and strategies, and integration of guidelines for clinical conduct. Lacking EHR type specification and diversity in study method imply that there is a strong need for further research on the factors that may make EHR may support QM.",['Peter Triantafillou'],22b91fc9-feab-4cf9-b60c-43120d249426,0,"['121a34f1-b67d-4ceb-a958-cb66b7b3318d', '16573321-29e4-4da1-99c4-61302a9adaec', '2be0e234-9612-4c9b-8570-df2cd3a574f6', '35693097-97fc-41d9-af9c-722a5f2f1158', '4c35f985-efac-4616-a204-79430c7417ff', '50acf203-7106-4310-8705-496943d84bb0', '565c5491-b01c-432c-ba88-3d94160958aa', '56b06f72-1b03-470a-bbdc-3f1ece9eff55', '7c900511-6f70-4da6-b445-714fb0ac098c', '7d9a5308-2138-4233-be6f-3df2a78f0da9', '85b37dbc-7292-4444-a525-f87f3ee68cdb', '9553a7a7-552a-4ea2-972e-fce14c89227e', 'cc920596-7b5f-41c7-967d-5471397d285f', 'd073082e-80e7-41aa-83f6-80f40adca402', 'd74ea209-fd0e-4365-b9cb-9b84253b1df4']",Making electronic health records support quality management: A narrative review,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2017

715,"The present article deals with fast transient phenomena involving fluids and structures undergoing large displacements and rotations, associated with non-linear local behavior, such as plasticity, damage and failure. In this context, classical Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian approaches reach a limit where it is not possible to update the fluid grid to follow the structural motion without encountering entangled fluid cells forcing the simulations to stop. So-called immersed boundary approaches are thus frequently preferred in this situation, since they allow breaking the topological connection between the fluid and structural meshes and retrieve the expected level of robustness to handle complex structural motions. Their potential for efficient, robust and accurate simulations at the industrial level has been proven. However, it appears that the classical implementation of such approaches still imposes some constraints over the fluid mesh with respect to the structural mesh in terms of cell sizes, due to the expression of the kinematic links between fluid and structural velocities, which must be improved. It is demonstrated in the present article that an extended regularized framework can be designed to overcome the current drawbacks, but it comes with a significant increase of computational complexity and requires an extension of the classical software features encountered in fast transient dynamics simulation programs.","['Olivier Jamond', 'Vincent Faucher']",45e6d4e6-30a6-4e20-80c3-d3fb8fa5af72,0,"['24a741ae-9903-45f8-9a9e-3b95e6a6a1f9', 'fd116e81-a480-4974-8544-1bafdd00ff6e']",Regularized immersed boundary-type formulation for fast transient dynamics with fluid-structure interaction,Advances in Engineering Software,2017

719,"Timely completion of projects is an important factor for project success. However, projects often exceed their predefined deadline, which results in a late project delivery and an increase in the total project cost. In order to increase the probability of timely completion, a project buffer can be planned at the end of a project. During project execution, an assessment of the total buffer consumption at the project completion date can be made in order to periodically monitor the project progress. When the expected buffer consumption is higher than 100%, the project deadline is expected to be exceeded and the project manager should take corrective actions to get the project back on track.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, a new buffer monitoring approach is introduced, which sets tolerance limits for Earned Value Management/Earned Schedule (EVM/ES) schedule performance metrics by allocating the project buffer over the different project phases. The purpose of these tolerance limits is to provide the project manager with accurate and reliable information on the expected project outcome during the project execution. A computational study is carried out to assess the performance of the proposed approach and to compare its performance with traditional buffer consumption monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing performance metrics for tolerance limits have been put into a hypothesis testing framework, and new metrics have been developed in order to fill the detected gaps in performance measurement. Results have shown that the proposed tolerance limits improve the performance of the monitoring phase, especially for parallel projects. Consequently, the underperformance of EVM/ES for parallel projects is mitigated by these limits.","['Annelies Martens', 'Mario Vanhoucke']",2d9243ad-0568-4920-b0c9-1e65a7de3ef5,50,"['0064da1c-ba6d-41dd-9b5c-83714881e284', '0c584145-466b-42e2-adef-beff9cf1b1ca', '190f33c3-65b1-4731-9c47-56da4aa354d6', '4e645a6c-4e18-4dcf-bf39-a45a6862966b', '56bd079e-15b2-40e5-9db1-3ef73f0f057d', 'aeba6ad8-57ff-44f4-9a48-4afb46c1ac73', 'd7c21de6-6ce7-4f9a-a49b-e0829ff0248f', 'd85f0f39-3c20-48fc-ab56-42539effeb88', 'df671766-769c-4a1b-beed-9c4254d66c8d', 'f3d6ec76-7b8a-4631-b4f2-7713ebedaa9f']",A buffer control method for top-down project control,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
720,"Width is crucial to the performance of circulation network in urban rail transit station. However, poor performance has been observed in most existing circulation systems. In fact, randomness and state-dependence exist in circulation network where blocking and feedback cannot be ignored. In this paper, we develop a PH(n)/PH(n)/C/C state-dependent queuing network model with an analytical solution. This model describes the random and state-dependent arrival interval as well as service time by phase-type distribution. Feedback is also taken into account. The existing M/M(n)/C/C is a special case of the proposed PH(n)/PH(n)/C/C queuing network model, and the existing M/G(n)/C/C and D/D/1/C models can be approximated by the proposed network model. Then we present a programming formulation for circulation network design with blocking probability control based on the queuing network model. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed design method by comparing it with the existing design methods. The results show that: 1) the blocking probability is quite small and evenly distributed in the network designed by the new method, while much bigger and fluctuating blocking probabilities exist in networks designed by the other two methods; 2) other performance measures, like area per passenger, dwell time and throughput, are also considerably improved in the new method; 3) performance measures of the proposed method enjoy high performance-cost elasticity compared with the other two methods. An interesting insight is also obtained that the squared coefficient of variation for arrival interval plays an important role in determining the optimal width for circulation network.","['Juanxiu Zhu', 'Lu Hu', 'Yangsheng Jiang', 'Afaq Khattak']",cbe21029-3b44-46f0-ade1-5925822daaf0,50,"['0aaf1791-282a-474e-bafb-c1b48565e441', '1ce03bd4-86ee-4532-a11f-b427f809953c', '1e958491-8fe7-4856-9c9e-f657cfb5cc3d', '2f4bf601-19ee-4a47-9895-2ca92aa06551', '3db70cd5-25c4-434e-9d01-d349bf3e4a45', '4b50b2b4-9d5a-4606-bc9f-a6aefe5b2954', '5ea156bc-44d5-4a71-ad90-fdbad26168b2', '7575eab2-e938-46ef-8a4d-f04ef6ab4f09', '848a1f8b-5fef-40cc-9239-753d9d66969f', '89f120b6-382a-4e0a-8d2a-561482192ee7', '9be3ab4e-4e6f-4a58-b3cc-1a52fd66d32d', '9ff8012d-ca0d-4ee0-8a7d-81e1799a7a17', 'a05b5574-4600-47ee-a848-1ac2f606096d', 'b6cbc46e-6136-4014-a965-5fb97b18fd58', 'c7aecec6-f0a8-448b-b165-adf7111a799e', 'e08ecfe1-7508-4371-bf44-b71a2769238b', 'f638f359-03d0-475b-9f4c-44279b0c6b2a']",Circulation network design for urban rail transit station using a PH(n)/PH(n)/C/C queuing network model,European Journal of Operational Research,2017

723,"The salient region is the most important part of an image. The salient portion in images also attracts the most attention when people search for images in large-scale datasets. However, to improve image retrieval accuracy, considering only the most salient object in an image is insufficient because the background also influences the accuracy of image retrieval. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel concept called the extended salient region (ESR). First, the salient region of an input image is detected using a Region Contrast (RC) algorithm. Then, a polar coordinate system is constructed; the centroid of the salient region is set as the pole. Next, the regions surrounding the salient region are determined by the neighboring regions, moving in a counterclockwise direction. The resulting combination of the salient region and its surrounding regions is defined as the ESR. We extract the visual content from the ESR using the well-known Bag of Words (BoW) model based on Gabor, SIFT and HSVH features and propose a graph model of the visual content nodes to represent the input image. Then, we design a novel algorithm to perform matching between two images. We also define a new similarity measure by combining the similarities of the salient region and the surrounding regions using weights. Finally, to better evaluate the image retrieval accuracy, an improved measure called the mean label average precision (MLAP) is proposed. The results of experiments on three benchmark datasets (Corel, TU Darmstadt, and Caltech 101) demonstrate that our proposed ESR model and region-matching algorithm are highly effective at image retrieval, and can achieve more accurate query results than current state-of-the-art methods.","['Jing Zhang', 'Shengwei Feng', 'Da Li', 'Yongwei Gao', 'Zhihua Chen', 'Yubo Yuan']",d24ef774-d6db-4acd-af4a-245cf50dbe61,0,"['1978940d-1072-48b0-aaf9-fec4192b9e71', '1ea5e7e1-b1ac-4b50-ad75-d882e4627317', '26518937-43b0-4183-9750-9377b1be9a70', '26ab03bd-0d0a-428b-a176-9cacb85678ae', '332da7ae-1b1a-4fe3-aeb4-29586fedfba2', '357d870e-6832-4f0e-8bcc-5dbcf2ee8134', '42deee0b-cb3d-4267-b6a8-47d482f57c76', '45beeef2-a57d-436d-8fc4-56136234b4b9', '4d0beed2-fc4c-46bd-9108-1c470f5e329c', '4f24ebe5-751f-42b0-86b4-71b9b5bc55f4', '58986749-f7f2-4c0c-a0f8-37180df48756', '5c5a8a37-8cd1-4082-b92a-ec4c0f54e4c5', '6018a516-8149-4bce-bc33-5449d86e58c2', '6a000fd7-4ca4-48b0-a255-f60249fc336e', '750b0ac1-2ac9-4273-a9c8-baad11e26fcd', '7a315347-a6ad-4895-accf-6599e78be574', '86b626a6-f948-45ea-8e92-8102e0dc5ef8', 'a81078ed-9cf5-4ddf-bbfb-8d8677338729', 'b7e49c62-0e4d-486b-84d2-bf27f817ecc2', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'be387792-07f8-438b-8da3-b494d3ddb72f', 'c4b5b65f-f0e5-4f43-9c4b-f4804c76597f', 'c5f6be4e-4dd3-46c5-bd40-af1466dd2081', 'c7f8ad49-99d3-4c1c-a2f5-adf9691128ff', 'c8f80ea6-4602-458c-9a70-daf1c646c89b', 'dac0843c-6b1f-4799-8a24-ff8e21ae61af', 'e46a78d1-a202-471e-b46e-a8876e8a9139', 'ed37ee82-6315-41d0-bb2a-336629947921', 'fd14fab9-2ad3-4bb8-9d1b-285c62bbeeb2']",Image retrieval using the extended salient region,Information Sciences,2017

The widely used 3D-IAEA benchmark problem is selected as the typical PWR core and the neutron flux field is solved. Besides, some additional thermal parameters are assumed to obtain the temperature distribution. Then the total and local entropy production is calculated to evaluate the energy dissipation. Using RSM, three directions of optimization are taken, which aim to determine the minimum of power peak factor Pmax, peak temperature Tmax and total entropy production Stot. These parameters reflect the safety and energy dissipation in the core. Finally, an optimization scheme was obtained, which reduced Pmax, Tmax and Stot by 23%, 8.7% and 16%, respectively. The optimization results are satisfactory.","['Yi-Ning Zhang', 'Hao-Chun Zhang', 'Haiyan Yu', 'Chao Ma']",a52aaf7f-6927-4286-bde0-22085fb5168c,0,['6fb63b25-5d8a-4daf-b0cb-a6626a31860a'],Response Surface Methodology Control Rod Position Optimization of a Pressurized Water Reactor Core Considering Both High Safety and Low Energy Dissipation,Entropy,2017
726,"This paper studies codes that correct a burst of deletions or insertions. Namely, a code will be called a    $b$    -burst-deletion/insertion-correcting code  if it can correct a burst of deletions/insertions of any    $b$    consecutive bits. While the lower bound on the redundancy of such codes was shown by Levenshtein to be asymptotically    $\log (n)+b-1$   , the redundancy of the best code construction by Cheng  et al.  is    $b(\log (n/b+1))$   . In this paper, we close on this gap and provide codes with redundancy at most    $\log (n) + (b-1)\log (\log (n)) +b -\log (b)$   . We first show that the models of insertions and deletions are equivalent and thus it is enough to study codes correcting a burst of deletions. We then derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the size of    $b$   -burst-deletion-correcting codes and extend the burst deletion model to two more cases: 1) a deletion burst of at most    $b$    consecutive bits and 2) a deletion burst of size at most    $b$    (not necessarily consecutive).

727,"In many machine learning applications such as computer-aided diagnosis, gene sequence analysis or natural language processing, categorical data appears. For small-scale data set with high dimensions, since relatively small proportion of possible categorical configurations are covered by training samples, conventional methods based on frequency information such as Dirichlet Compound Multinomial distribution usually runs into problems of over-fitting. Latent gaussian process is an effective bayesian non-parametric technique for categorical data modeling, which was proposed as an unsupervised method to embed unlabelled categorical data into a continuous and low-dimensional space through gaussian process. As a probabilistic generative model, latent gaussian process owns the ability of density estimation. In this paper, we propose a generative classification model as a supervised method for labelled categorical data, in which we use latent gaussian process to estimate the class-conditional densities. Since the complexity of gaussian process model can adapt to the size of training data, our method is able to effectively model small-sale categorical data. Experimental results show that our proposal can achieve better classification performance compared with other classification models for categorical data.","['Fengmao Lv', 'Guowu Yang', 'William Zhu', 'Chuan Liu']",2b9957d3-4bc0-47bf-a7ae-36344b9e1fcf,0,"['0df33660-1849-4adf-9af3-5d3d8ebee840', '1cc573b3-84fb-4e92-b23e-1ef73d3331a7', '282e028c-d751-4985-aecb-6db8126ac1a0', '3715c870-6569-4d20-8797-af8569e5fde5', '4ed5406a-0b46-4103-bce0-7ceab8b401bb', '505bfde2-60d3-4926-bdd1-506578a6eb60', '873a56c8-2030-4205-9842-4f8c81ab3060', 'a121a49b-23be-4764-bedc-0c267be47812', 'a66c42eb-c498-45d0-8868-3cac0fd8e4b5', 'cba3fc5b-b95f-451d-bb76-fc2f3bc09095', 'cf016c44-f474-4ada-bea3-6295725c6405', 'd28acb36-5766-4c1e-8d57-a55c2630bd90', 'eb2e2ff2-997e-4edd-8afc-3a3d3297dcb2', 'f70b9a91-f4cd-453a-9e31-1f9d4918f949', 'f7b7042b-4eab-4329-96d2-f92ccde24d0c']",Generative classification model for categorical data based on latent Gaussian process,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017

An adaptive control law is proposed to establish a fuzzy-gain update law for the AOFSC and a parameter tie for the NDO such that the convergence of system's dynamic response is a Lyapunov asymptotically stable process.

731,"In this paper we establish conditions under which uniqueness of market equilibrium is obtained in a setup where prior to trading of electricity, transmission capacities between different market regions are fixed. In our setup, firms facing fluctuating demand decide on the size and location of production facilities. They make production decisions constrained by the invested capacities, taking into account that market prices (partially) reflect scarce transmission capacities between the different market zones. For this type of peak-load pricing model on a network we state general conditions for existence and uniqueness of the market equilibrium and provide a characterization of equilibrium investment and production. The presented analysis covers the cases of perfect competition and monopoly—the case of strategic firms is approximated by a conjectural variations approach. Our result is a prerequisite for analyzing regulatory policy options with computational multilevel equilibrium models, since uniqueness of the equilibrium at lower levels is of key importance when solving these models. Thus, our paper contributes to an evolving strand of literature that analyzes regulatory policy based on computational multilevel equilibrium models and aims at taking into account individual objectives of various agents, among them not only generators and customers but also, e.g., the regulator deciding on network expansion.","['Veronika Grimm', 'Lars Schewe', 'Martin Schmidt', 'Gregor Zöttl']",2a5b7126-1a32-477c-809d-0a973b4ef567,0,"['1977df15-1a4e-4ae0-8217-a437de488e6c', '25694def-94c6-4948-9829-92b7524534fc', '31ed1a68-5db5-42e7-91e9-1c5747f0c6bf', '332e72d5-688a-46fa-96aa-279b5509a2ec', '3d7069c0-4b66-472a-a2db-716bb523bee4', '3fd9b4e2-7c00-4064-918a-a1a557ab8863', '4e6c6162-f864-42c1-9e16-e82b79d83d7c', '61026984-cbfb-4a42-b22d-a6cf07453c1e', '61c7f23c-6e56-44b6-af49-23abac3114cd', '73a29bf8-52e2-4d1b-84f0-ec5a8d5e2b54', 'bc4ad2cc-42a5-4e61-bc9e-7f083bc40fe5', 'e092bff2-98e2-4a5b-896b-1ccde292a013']",Uniqueness of market equilibrium on a network: A peak-load pricing approach,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
732,"Nonconvex variants of support vector machines (SVMs) have been developed for various purposes. For example, robust SVMs attain robustness to outliers by using a nonconvex loss function, while extended -SVM (E-SVM) extends the range of the hyperparameter by introducing a nonconvex constraint. Here, we consider an extended robust support vector machine (ER-SVM), a robust variant of E-SVM. ER-SVM combines two types of nonconvexity from robust SVMs and E-SVM. Because of the two nonconvexities, the existing algorithm we proposed needs to be divided into two parts depending on whether the hyperparameter value is in the extended range or not. The algorithm also heuristically solves the nonconvex problem in the extended range. In this letter, we propose a new, efficient algorithm for ER-SVM. The algorithm deals with two types of nonconvexity while never entailing more computations than either E-SVM or robust SVM, and it finds a critical point of ER-SVM. Furthermore, we show that ER-SVM includes the existing robus...","['Shuhei Fujiwara', 'Akiko Takeda', 'Takafumi Kanamori']",6ed14310-1cca-4b58-bbc0-814cad2f783d,0,"['345914b4-a1ae-431a-8dde-a13b541ac0ec', '41be2b29-27c5-402a-9554-d4c0fa56acfe', 'c0fd031f-4e66-4b62-913b-f2de13134f85', 'd81f7541-00f7-405f-80e5-b7424873d45e', 'dd5a3ef5-9d44-4dde-bcdb-dc4d17c69073', 'de201392-a6c7-4465-a966-c26b3ca31830', 'ed869b16-2abb-4ac8-bb5f-790948d0bd56', 'fb66dee1-b486-4cb9-bc64-ef4ddb3fcd9f']",DC Algorithm for Extended Robust Support Vector Machine,Neural Computation,2017

734,"Assessing the quality of scientific outputs (i.e. research papers, books and reports) is a challenging issue. Although in practice, the basic quality of scientific outputs is evaluated by committees/peers (peer review) who have general knowledge and competencies. However, their assessment might not comprehensively consider different dimensions of the quality of the scientific outputs. Hence, there is a requirement to evaluate scientific outputs based on some other metrics which cover more aspects of quality after publishing, which is the aim of this study. To reach this aim, first different quality metrics are identified through an extensive literature review. Then a recently developed multi-criteria methodology (best worst method) is used to find the importance of each quality metric. Finally, based on the importance of each quality metric and the data which are collected from Scopus, the quality of research papers published by the members of a university faculty is measured. The proposed model in this paper provides the opportunity to measure quality of research papers not only by considering different aspects of quality, but also by considering the importance of each quality metric.

736,"Prognostics, which usually means the prediction of the field reliability or the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), is the basis of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM). Research in this paper focuses on remaining useful life prediction of aircraft engine in the same gradual degradation mode. As the gradual degradation with same failure mechanism has some regularity in macro, there would be certain relation between an arbitrary point of the degradation process and the correspondent RUL. This paper tries to learn this certain relation via neural network and the learned network, which reflects the relation, can be partly perceived as degradation pattern. The main prognostic idea of degradation pattern learning is firstly proposed and illustrated. And then an improved back propagation neural network is designed and analyzed as the implementation technique, in whose loss function an adjacent difference item is added. Next details of implementation via adjacent difference neural network are elaborated. Finally, the proposed approach is validated by two experiments respectively using different aircraft engine degradation datasets. Results of the experiments show a relatively good prediction accuracy, which verifies the correctness, effectiveness and practicability of the idea.","['Z.

737,"Based on an approach used to model environmental flows such as rivers and estuaries, we develop a new multi-layered model for thin liquid film flow on a locally-heated inclined plane. The film is segmented into layers of equal thickness with the velocity and temperature of each governed by a momentum and energy equation integrated across each layer individually. Matching conditions applied between the layers ensure the continuity of down-plane velocity, temperature, stress and heat flux. Variation in surface tension of the liquid with temperature is considered so that local heating induces a surface shear stress which leads to variation in the film height profile (the Marangoni effect). Moderate inertia and heat convection effects are also included.#R##N##R##N#In the absence of Marangoni effects, when the film height is uniform, we test the accuracy of the model by comparing it against a solution of the full heat equation using finite differences. The multi-layer model offers significant improvements over that of a single layer. Notably, with a sufficient number of layers, the solution does not exhibit local regions of negative temperature often predicted using a single-layer model.#R##N##R##N#With Marangoni effects included the film height varies however we find heat convection can mitigate this variation by reducing the surface temperature gradient and hence the surface shear stress. Numerical results corresponding to the flow of water on a vertical plane show that very thin films are dominated by the Marangoni shear stress which can be sufficiently strong to overcome gravity leading to a recirculation in the velocity field. This effect reduces with increasing film thickness and the recirculation eventually disappears. In this case heating is confined entirely to the interior of the film leading to a uniform height profile.","['E. D. Kay', 'Stephen Hibberd', 'H.

738,"Breast cancer is an essential health issue and more than one million women die of breast cancer each year in the world. Primary prevention seems impossible since the causes of this disease still remain unknown. Early detection and diagnosis is the key for breast cancer control. Clusters of microcalcifications in mammogram have been mainly targeted as an early sign of breast cancer and their earliest detection is vital to reduce the mortality rate. Since the size of microcalcification is very tiny and may be overlooked by the observing radiologist, a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system has been developed for efficient microcalcification detection and it eliminates the operator dependency. In order to determine the presence of microcalcification clusters in the mammogram, special attention is paid to the analysis of the structure and brightness of the mammogram tissues. The detection of microcalcification clusters is achieved by the following computerized approach. The nodular structured microcalcifications in the abnormal mammogram image are detected based on multiscale products of eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The detected image contains calcifications along with background information. To eliminate the unnecessary background information, the response image coming out from Hessian matrix approach is passed to the thresholding technique such as probability density function based Tsallis entropy, in which the potential microcalcifications are segmented efficiently. The proposed method is evaluated with the DDSM, MIAS and UCSF databases, which included a wide spectrum of difficult-to-detect cases. The detection performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by using 234 mammograms containing 171 microcalcification clusters. The detection method has a true positive ratio of 97.08% with 0.45 false positives per image. The proposed algorithm is positively evaluated through the clinical study. The main merit of the system is that it maintains the shape and size of microcalcifications.","['Marimuthu Muthuvel', 'B.

739,"Building managers need effective tools to improve occupants’ experiences considering constraints of energy efficiency. Current building management systems are limited to coordinating device services in simple and prefixed situations. Think of an office with lights offering services, such as turn on a light, which are invoked by the system to automatically control the lights. In spite of the evident potential for energy saving, the office occupants often end up in the dark, they have too much light when working with computers, or unnecessary lights are turned on. The office is thus not aware of the occupants’ presence nor anticipates their activities. Our proposal is to coordinate services while anticipating occupant activities with sufficient accuracy. Finding and composing services that will support occupant activities is however a complex problem. The high number of services, the continuous transformation of buildings, and the various building standards imply a search through a vast number of possible contextual situations every time occupants perform activities. Our solution to this building coordination problem is based on Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning in combination with activity recognition. While HTN planning provides powerful means for composing services automatically, activity recognition is needed to identify occupant activities as soon as they occur. The output of this combination is a sequence of services that needs to be executed under the uncertainty of building environments. Our solution supports continuous context changes and service failures by using an advanced orchestration strategy. We design, implement and deploy a system in two cases, namely offices and a restaurant, in our own office building at the University of Groningen. We show energy savings in the order of 80% when compared to manual control in both cases, and 60% when compared to using only movement sensors. Moreover, we show that one can save a figure of €600 annually for the electricity costs of the restaurant. We use a survey to evaluate the experience of restaurant occupants. The majority of them are satisfied with the solution and find it useful. Finally, the technical evaluation provides insights into the efficiency of our system.","['Ilche Georgievski', 'Tuan Anh Nguyen', 'Faris Nizamic', 'Brian Setz', 'Aliaksandr Lazovik', 'Marco Aiello']",82281509-c43b-42b3-91f0-7d43435d9e0d,0,"['00b04479-dab4-4127-a7ea-15d22a16de99', '0f4426c2-cace-4a55-8ee0-f250249c6ad6', '120457f6-4201-4000-b7ce-7dd292c031ee', '30dcb593-4902-4a60-aa6c-700e5ca0b2a5', '3e186221-571c-4aca-b2da-02c410cf40b2', '3e23561f-18f9-4127-9c37-0ca276dbd951', '40c69894-9cd9-4f73-97b1-b83c2c617b39', '46d6e0d3-c130-4e29-bff9-2a4fd3c59caf', '507d931e-d5bb-48a5-ae7d-90ca0420847e', '669b3615-1f98-45f9-a6f9-6e29079170c0', '766273da-a900-44d3-872c-de9d00857e9a', '78fc42b6-f64a-4d44-bc75-e08dc1998d94', '7c84b98d-920a-48f4-9135-1c46d60159c7', '7ffa0f9d-01aa-4893-a25f-7f689c3fcd83', '82cf3664-f1cb-4d49-981a-21988bd5f38f', '8caf5e39-eebb-40a9-a74e-37c2f0b7612b', '8dfa0c8d-2929-4b4e-b03b-ebd23f55a4b2', '8f542357-6848-4024-8d93-ab24726f885a', 'a2efe712-f18f-4c4e-9d7b-7a667ac16e31', 'b20e3518-0499-4f34-b21f-e78efd0f6396', 'b5ecc803-0290-4322-adba-570ca5ba1c56', 'ba807e1d-ad51-4d86-bdbf-8d415feed3b9', 'ca08430f-6ef7-4b7e-9871-b2c1becd9e32', 'cf023277-38c1-4f70-a1b0-450b75a8f84d', 'd57ecd01-9f07-4709-9ded-935c5b776e78', 'd699d429-66c7-4e62-97f7-be46a1c239e0', 'd770e931-d2ef-49e5-9d82-45d90f422d09', 'de60ae11-fb7e-4783-861b-6dd7ae012a9f', 'e4a17b84-e88a-4e7a-8749-14ab2ed12dc2', 'eb411995-e065-494e-b834-133db70677c1', 'ee809ead-133a-4e37-aa5d-09a125cc37f6']",Planning meets activity recognition: Service coordination for intelligent buildings,Pervasive and Mobile Computing,2017

741,"The aim of process discovery, originating from the area of process mining, is to discover a process model based on business process execution data. A majority of process discovery techniques relies on an event log as an input. An event log is a static source of historical data capturing the execution of a business process. In this paper, we focus on process discovery relying on online streams of business process execution events. Learning process models from event streams poses both challenges and opportunities, i.e. we need to handle unlimited amounts of data using finite memory and, preferably, constant time. We propose a generic architecture that allows for adopting several classes of existing process discovery techniques in context of event streams. Moreover, we provide several instantiations of the architecture, accompanied by implementations in the process mining toolkit ProM (http://promtools.org).

743,"This study focuses on the problem of robust adaptive synchronization of uncertain bilinear chaotic systems. A Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy bilinear system (TSFBS) is employed herein to describe a bilinear chaotic system. A robust adaptive observer, which estimates the states of the TSFBS, is also developed. Advanced adaptive laws using a projection operator are designed to achieve both the robustness for the external disturbances and the adaptation of unknown system parameters. A comparison with the existing observer shows that the proposed observer can achieve a faster parameter adaptation and a robust synchronization for an uncertain TSFBS with disturbances when the adaptive laws are utilized. The asymptotic stability and the robust performance of the error dynamics are guaranteed by some assumptions and the Lyapunov stability theory. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme using examples of the generalized Lorenz system in various aspects.","['Sangyun Lee', 'Mignon Park', 'J.

744,"Vehicular ad hoc networks are a special type of MANET providing vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to roadside wireless communications. Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) have been designed in order to assist drivers on the road with a variety of applications especially in preventing danger and saving lives. For such ends, broadcasting is a suitable scheme to convey emergency messages dissemination to the entire network. Broadcasting in VANETs is a challenging task due to the specific VANET features such as nodes mobility and frequent topology changes. VANET applications, especially those related with human life saving, are delay sensitive and have specific requirements in terms of performances and QoS. A QoS aware broadcasting scheme relies on different factors and has to deal with hard constraints. In this paper, we introduce a survey of broadcasting in vehicular networks and discussion of different performance and QoS related to broadcasting issues. Furthermore, a comparative study of QoS aware broadcasting protocols classifying them according to different taxonomies is elaborated. This survey specifies QoS requirements and performance metrics of VANET services. Furthermore, this survey focuses on QoS aware broadcasting as a challenging problem regrading VANET characteristics.","['Abir Mchergui', 'Tarek Moulahi', 'Bechir Alaya', 'Salem Nasri']",6b1ac529-6a5e-4755-a56d-14660cc90327,0,"['00c394fa-01ab-49bf-9729-f897e56f10f2', '0357a3f4-1269-4603-b301-28870868d69f', '0871ab9a-9b73-4cfc-8fa1-edc73044582c', '0c14bff8-0f2f-446b-be41-655edbe8850d', '15d63b6e-db28-47fb-8c78-a7f91f5f77dc', '1bb26548-fb8f-449c-bf46-595564bf4938', '1cb226a7-ab1b-4085-928c-47aa32a5cd8e', '1e7f2bab-8829-4880-8967-b7f9e42b2036', '1fdf2d87-1e7a-4f7e-b233-d10c43abec7b', '1ffd1577-b257-4f95-b9c8-1dd7b55ee56c', '22796dd3-c769-47a9-82c0-8d8f2d4efda8', '230f7c02-d35c-47e0-8873-ad71095f3304', '2d11dca4-bea6-4f91-b713-85f1bd560740', '2f36d709-aaeb-4205-a2e2-694b8084e0c0', '353fab7d-6f82-410c-9500-3a4012cd095c', '3b9a54f8-8cda-4973-a213-65c4d5c74066', '3ca7bbed-44ca-43c2-aaeb-94e4e44d8005', '3e0088e4-d34e-4617-adab-445b335377fa', '3e76dd8b-9366-4607-964a-12d62f48c2dc', '3f5a4c71-a709-45a8-b58c-d1e636586cf2', '42ce4f2e-d049-4705-8618-acae6b5ff197', '458fad0b-c4fd-4d1f-8fcb-a46b2e4c5380', '4a8c818a-971b-4fe9-9b34-0e6fb07ee66f', '4cdcec9f-8b48-4d8e-ac1a-9bf0a60b2ba6', '4fc3c7c4-ba9f-4f96-acb6-06742463fb15', '543a632d-89ab-44e7-8f4e-0d1702f22bda', '5b818229-173c-4e50-af96-fc535cbe00a1', '5b8ae32f-d2a7-4bec-a06d-3f30f728e1df', '5ef3203d-1ba2-4e5e-a4a3-df4dbe46cae5', '613561ba-0571-4429-b0d7-2156af2db991', '64ee07f3-ae2b-49a1-b6df-2f20ed0ea285', '6812c5ec-f121-47da-af22-16b442f5e80c', '68d24930-8223-4df9-a513-84a9323577b5', '6fb33c05-50c9-44c7-82b4-094a34003ef0', '7cffa8ab-b7e9-4731-a307-be5a3cd66195', '8100d490-b0de-4cac-8031-e4147e78f1e7', '85fad7b5-ed44-4987-9883-58c8726a95bf', '8e1b8155-4d6c-4d26-9f02-d45cf21110d9', '8e56bcb3-0575-4356-9dfb-5d7679ebac64', '8ebb5721-bafb-4f3a-90d3-d1cc0174820a', '922b8a61-524f-4d78-9ea5-af4e96a1c397', '9341d35c-a4b9-4768-8509-02b583bfe264', '9442bbe8-812b-4b79-bbe4-488e1b24255a', '98407db0-5539-422f-bde7-14e15dc69576', '985b216a-4aa5-4d67-8769-4488dcaf2c87', '9d40f81a-777a-4955-a47f-003473e22cdf', 'a00d93a2-42fd-46b9-8947-216320c4a4e2', 'a2bad5b6-0623-41ec-ba74-4b123a76232a', 'a4638c25-e3cb-420a-94b3-afb01cd5ba9f', 'a4eee61a-fd24-4f31-850d-d8702685037f', 'a54c30ed-5bc4-4e5b-b1db-4ad35e02eeac', 'a5dc17ec-6487-4677-a0a2-e9f96e28eb78', 'a846c74b-9f8a-4627-9192-84c3bc682f94', 'b2ecb519-0a02-48ba-aab9-6285e4d5135a', 'b73857a0-c0df-4c63-9973-4ec714fd06d4', 'bb44bb95-2128-4565-b11c-0b1c32cedde1', 'c08c0d14-10be-4e4c-8a36-61474120ac6b', 'c31b1d40-a10d-49ab-8e73-eda23fda5def', 'c655e2a8-3bab-415f-90cd-420c6d374f43', 'cc30b7c5-f9ce-418e-a855-932f2198775f', 'd6102df1-13e9-4d93-a675-85334bc3abc9', 'd8d85e71-8b09-434c-9f3a-d7af7317096a', 'da037580-89de-425b-a378-d1dcc3c286f9', 'dc975e34-ab54-47d1-b73f-97d2027d423f', 'df4d29f8-ba1d-4261-ac84-b914318d2d91', 'eb7af2c6-35ac-4e1f-ad7a-ab0be59f66ae', 'efbebe08-63e1-4df4-9dd8-8eb2764991c1', 'f5095fe2-ff6e-460e-b77b-ccfd73b40777', 'f5cb55d5-96d9-4d12-b860-ba3cfd502a3f', 'f8bbe732-cf7f-4623-b3c6-ee78986024a8']",A survey and comparative study of QoS aware broadcasting techniques in VANET,Telecommunication Systems,2017
745,"In this study, bilateral control between electric and hydraulic actuators is investigated. Bilateral control realizes telemanipulation of remote robots with the sense of touch. We focus on the system of local (master) robots, manipulated by operators that are driven by electric actuators, and slave robots, which work in remote places that are driven by hydraulic actuators. To obtain bilateral control in this situation, we find that combination of three key techniques is necessary. The first key is oblique coordinate control, which can decouple position and force controllers of bilateral control. The second key is linearization of hydraulic actuators as third-order systems including oil compression by using disturbance observers. In the absence of linearization, the design becomes practically impossible because of the need to apply complicated models. Since the master robots are second-order systems, and the slave robots are linearized as third-order systems, oblique coordinate control cannot be implemented. Then, the last key is the agreement of system order of electric and hydraulic actuators by using a pseudodifferentiator. Two conventional controllers and the proposed method are experimentally and analytically compared. The proposed method shows the best tracking performance and is the most stable in contact control among the three controllers.","['Sho Sakaino', 'Takayuki Furuya', 'Toshiaki Tsuji']",9c2009b0-b63e-4da0-98fd-c0fa9e267f7c,0,"['0146ba1f-5233-4de9-93d2-96e56edae38c', '1562aa62-6c56-4fbe-a4aa-13641c5def20', '165464d1-de9d-41ba-ab8a-648dc3dad67d', '27d1d35e-44f6-4fe4-bee4-2947cb94f45d', '3f248619-bcfa-49b8-9931-9b7945a9db6f', '4a888fdd-153b-498e-bfc1-9a352e4254d6', '4afbff65-fa52-4e62-a6c9-554a292fcf2d', '5161d45d-5f74-4890-ae28-80faedfc6137', '58ad6017-e5b5-4e40-9091-30ca16895f79', '5ce02f03-864e-466a-b0a8-0b0981acd3d5', '8346b142-ba96-4ad1-be71-89aa28c07c29', '84b73d17-ead6-45c7-be16-4e835efac424', '8511b05d-7c3a-4632-a937-d5afb50782b8', 'b0d3fa45-5aca-40c9-aa00-44baeefd75c1', 'b53960b7-5f6c-46c4-89af-e70f355270ae', 'ce90b169-a54b-43d6-838a-968b941e0f58', 'ea3218b2-dbaf-4286-b4f9-b529cf4d262f', 'eff4e62d-7eb8-482c-a0ee-e039868022b8', 'f9bf1b4a-01e5-4bcb-9b82-4509e3427118', 'fd68978d-fe65-4074-ba88-643076fa3c6a', 'fdd3f1f3-d999-4efd-af74-698d28201e1e']",Bilateral Control Between Electric and Hydraulic Actuators Using Linearization of Hydraulic Actuators,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2017
746,"Phenotypic studies in Triticeae have shown that low temperature-induced protective mechanisms are developmentally regulated and involve dynamic acclimation processes. Understanding these mechanisms is important for breeding cold-resistant wheat cultivars. In this study, we combined three computational techniques for the analysis of gene expression data from spring and winter wheat cultivars subjected to low temperature treatments. Our main objective was to construct a comprehensive network of cold response transcriptional events in wheat, and to identify novel cold tolerance candidate genes in wheat. We assigned novel cold stress-related roles to 35 wheat genes, uncovered novel transcription (TF)-gene interactions, and identified 127 genes representing known and novel candidate targets associated with cold tolerance in wheat. Our results also show that delays in terms of activation or repression of the same genes across wheat cultivars play key roles in phenotypic differences among winter and spring wheat cultivars, and adaptation to low temperature stress, cold shock and cold acclimation. Using three computational approaches, we identified novel putative cold-response genes and TF-gene interactions. These results provide new insights into the complex mechanisms regulating the expression of cold-responsive genes in wheat.","['Alain B.

Due to lack of training samples in a detection problem, it is more difficult than classification-purposed BS. The objective function, called maximum-submaximum-ratio (MSR) gauging target-background separation, is proposed for target detection during PSO searching. Typical target detectors such as target-constrained interference-minimized filter and adaptive coherence estimator are studied. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MSR-based objective function in conjunction with PSO-based searching can select a small band set while yielding similar or even better detection performance than using all the original bands, sequential forward search-based BS, or BS relying on detection map similarity assessment.","['Yan Xu', 'Qian Du', 'Nicolas H.

750,"The statistical leverage scores of a matrix A are the squared row-norms of the matrix containing its (top) left singular vectors and the coherence is the largest leverage score. These quantities are of interest in recently-popular problems such as matrix completion and Nystrom-based low-rank matrix approximation as well as in large-scale statistical data analysis applications more generally; moreover, they are of interest since they define the key structural nonuniformity that must be dealt with in developing fast randomized matrix algorithms. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary n × d matrix A, with n ≫ d, and that returns as output relative-error approximations to all n of the statistical leverage scores. The proposed algorithm runs (under assumptions on the precise values of n and d) in O(nd logn) time, as opposed to the O(nd2) time required by the naive algorithm that involves computing an orthogonal basis for the range of A. Our analysis may be viewed in terms of computing a relative-error approximation to an underconstrained least-squares approximation problem, or, relatedly, it may be viewed as an application of Johnson-Lindenstrauss type ideas. Several practically-important extensions of our basic result are also described, including the approximation of so-called cross-leverage scores, the extension of these ideas to matrices with n ≈ d, and the extension to streaming environments.","['Petros Drineas', 'Malik Magdon-Ismail', 'Michael W.

Though the novelty of these entities naturally attracts mentions, due to lack of prior knowledge, it is more challenging to collect knowledge about such entities than pre-existing entities, whose KBs are comprehensively annotated through LBSNs and EBSNs. In this paper, we focus on knowledge harvesting for emerging spatial entities (ESEs), such as new businesses and venues, assuming we have only a list of ESE names. Existing techniques for knowledge base (KB) harvesting are primarily associated with information extraction from textual corpora. In contrast, we propose a multimodal method for event detection based on the complementary interaction of image, text, and user information between multi-source platforms, namely Flickr and Twitter. We empirically validate our harvesting approaches improve the quality of KB with enriched place and event knowledge.","['Jinyoung Yeo', 'Hyunsouk Cho', 'Jin-woo Park', 'Seung-won Hwang']",5ca9c1de-5f34-44c5-8668-a7aad0e30d1a,0,"['0314113d-62b6-4b5a-954d-bd18f8beb2fa', '0bcd36cc-87e4-4f9e-9766-4c1b02162308', '0dc98852-d6ca-482e-886a-3d0d4e3de42e', '12b5f05e-19e3-42ba-82e5-030ad311e3ae', '1432ec53-7779-4409-b9d0-029f4922a8b7', '143f9c06-515f-429a-9c55-f18a127f6d49', '1591e4ba-6b58-4bd0-bde7-a68d947cc550', '1a07ffec-f69f-4362-bbf7-42616871c157', '1d710200-a021-4451-8bc6-5d27803ad5c9', '20240f2d-a194-4595-85c8-b9567ea77412', '2b6a3d0f-368f-45bb-be23-4e82f62fbbf7', '325a932c-75d6-4510-b73b-b826095f9ed8', '334653df-2fdd-4f99-8061-39525f42d0ba', '35063f66-8728-480a-ad01-f660b1258b22', '35f209ba-2df2-4cd7-9aff-9b5cf3fc95c8', '436e41a4-daaf-42e9-a47b-2102f6f88063', '446d0b0f-aada-496e-bbe9-a8d6c5a1ddb9', '45c68f00-c8c3-4520-bf13-d52205da54ef', '4bf9c03e-2b09-4739-940d-73505007aa1d', '4c4be745-1287-46ec-9dfe-95e0951b6a8c', '52c62602-4483-43f3-9041-0ec698caa024', '5dad8749-812f-475d-8799-93c33e6b626d', '687f4796-a9d4-43ef-9c85-e87b4c677083', '690046e7-5f68-4dca-8ca9-2b24b2d0e7b4', '6a93b210-469f-449d-b6a1-84c6b2e5b935', '702b7753-dd37-4f86-b945-734f8de73038', '7a5eacea-d001-4dc3-8f5d-35626882bcd8', '855bb0dd-5f23-4baf-9bc2-3a9f330482b6', '894e60f6-f3e6-42ef-8bbb-ae5c6cdbc166', '8c0bfce0-42ee-49c9-8432-c608f2708ec2', '8e639f57-5b3c-4452-b015-c52314806c9b', '9333f448-c6e0-41ce-a987-63e1859b9de3', '978669ec-7c40-4d0c-a4cd-2bcd8541dc1d', 'a7aeced8-e24e-4434-851c-9bdf3da3a95d', 'ac216780-4b3c-4aa9-b023-ca396ef4a4f5', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'bd59a6cb-70e5-488f-b9fe-2de7dd5e5376', 'c07e4aad-11ca-43dc-8a16-4cd766a3e9bb', 'c0a4e009-0c3b-4633-a58f-dde7acb70c74', 'cb99158c-9fde-4262-9a66-0b74cb0bd828', 'cbc6b390-e022-415e-9620-9cf581d18f8e', 'd7590549-65e6-493c-93dc-31a3d7b39079', 'da212ba7-a041-4aca-b221-8122ffa18f77', 'dd3d46c4-89c6-41e6-99ae-c8ffb2a5adb2', 'de706352-3222-4595-aa3d-8f869769a61c', 'ebb55d75-85e2-4973-9d7b-ecd5eeaeffcc', 'ed623364-b8e1-4b90-a3ce-119e8cb3f23d', 'f2fa9ea1-c221-40c2-adc9-0cca81bb5602', 'f8f433a1-f031-486f-83f3-8c4bd1cc4e5f', 'fb43371d-303b-4fb5-af3f-56863d50dd69', 'fcc0d637-9c16-4bb9-95ee-8a3f87d1d626', 'fdca1741-b24f-4cd7-a874-4207152c9cba', 'ff60fb38-a8bb-403f-a39c-c42a1dc5d84a']",Multimodal KB Harvesting for Emerging Spatial Entities,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017

Finally, we use the analysis dictionary to improve the efficiency of recognition by eliminating the constraint of the    $l_{0},$   -norm or    $l_{1},$   -norm of sparse code.

759,"Autonomous rock image classification can enhance the capability of robots for geological detection and enlarge the scientific returns, both in investigation on Earth and planetary surface exploration on Mars. Since rock textural images are usually inhomogeneous and manually hand-crafting features is not always reliable, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method to autonomously learn the feature representation for rock images. In our tests, rock image classification using the learned features shows that the learned features can outperform manually selected features. Self-taught learning is also proposed to learn the feature representation from a large database of unlabelled rock images of mixed class. The learned features can then be used repeatedly for classification of any subclass. This takes advantage of the large dataset of unlabelled rock images and learns a general feature representation for many kinds of rocks. We show experimental results supporting the feasibility of self-taught learning on rock images.","['Lei Shu', 'Kenneth A. McIsaac', 'Gordon R.

760,"In this paper, an optimal feedback, for a free vibrating semi-active controlled plant, is derived. The problem is represented as a constrained optimal control problem of a single input, free vibrating bilinear system, and a quadratic performance index. It is solved by using Krotov’s method and to this end, a novel sequence of Krotov functions that suits the addressed problem, is derived. The solution is arranged as an algorithm, which requires solving the states equation and a differential Lyapunov equation in each iteration. An outline of the proof for the algorithm convergence is provided. Emphasis is given on semi-active control design for stable free vibrating plants with a single control input. It is shown that a control force, derived by the proposed technique, obeys the physical constraint related with semi-active actuator force without the need of any arbitrary signal clipping. The control efficiency is demonstrated with a numerical example.","['Ido Halperin', 'Grigory Agranovich', 'Y.

761,"Designing a good scatterplot can be difficult for non-experts in visualization, because they need to decide on many parameters, such as marker size and opacity, aspect ratio, color, and rendering order. This paper contributes to research exploring the use of perceptual models and quality metrics to set such parameters automatically for enhanced visual quality of a scatterplot. A key consideration in this paper is the construction of a cost function to capture several relevant aspects of the human visual system, examining a scatterplot design for some data analysis task. We show how the cost function can be used in an optimizer to search for the optimal visual design for a user’s dataset and task objectives (e.g., “reliable linear correlation estimation is more important than class separation”). The approach is extensible to different analysis tasks. To test its performance in a realistic setting, we pre-calibrated it for correlation estimation, class separation, and outlier detection. The optimizer was able to produce designs that achieved a level of speed and success comparable to that of those using human-designed presets (e.g., in R or MATLAB). Case studies demonstrate that the approach can adapt a design to the data, to reveal patterns without user intervention.","['Luana Micallef', 'Gregorio Palmas', 'Antti Oulasvirta', 'Tino Weinkauf']",cf16905a-b4f7-42bc-9bfd-0e396425c4aa,50,"['0e2de3f6-1202-4abe-8ac2-c81bfa48726d', '158751ef-621d-4d59-b212-ca93684adecf', '15e0a15e-7d31-4e79-84ad-d258926c38d7', '2900aea2-11b9-460a-9835-2d687ec59ede', '375cb2d5-0ef9-428b-891f-52ce01ea9810', '4904565d-72b9-4555-a2fe-4d54362ffb63', '4af52a40-5d92-40c5-a7b7-546b8f2f7ff6', '6421aa8b-ed50-4b63-ab20-34e26e0ab8fa', '6549114f-c8b2-43af-85e3-0e27dc9d1904', '65cb335a-2930-45bc-aea3-fdefe8be5a2a', '68b607e1-846a-4790-b95d-ca844030f9d9', '79de9970-e3fb-4094-bacc-8918f2a95c36', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '8108e76f-28c8-4974-955c-97523ac1aac6', '8178aac4-06e8-4325-a2d7-c5f2b4d2915e', '8aa2a53a-6992-4d38-93d9-1f4c86021274', '903164a2-096b-4007-9e20-b8fb058c1795', '9b1bd7cf-175c-4488-8759-4b17febb431f', '9cff94f0-60b1-4a50-8dd1-a8eb304f774a', 'a34e48e0-ac77-413d-816e-1734b2180220', 'ce344827-075a-474d-96e7-b6d68ec409db', 'cfa747ca-9230-4a3e-9d53-a78df387a4ea', 'd6eea657-534e-4847-8a22-fce731a07cfa', 'db8d678c-a79a-45d2-9c14-ebaeaa14f39d', 'e42c1355-ae1c-45e7-8f28-b2289ae1e466', 'e9722de5-7920-4e2e-a44d-bb5e63b798b0', 'eacc5cce-ee0c-429e-9551-22e36663a450', 'f088df9a-552f-4d00-90ac-fb7e85ff8c8d']",Towards Perceptual Optimization of the Visual Design of Scatterplots,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,2017
762,"Looking at the operation of forming neat \(\alpha \)-reducts as a functor, with \(\alpha \) an infinite ordinal, we investigate when such a functor obtained by truncating \(\omega \) dimensions, has a right adjoint. We show that the neat reduct functor for representable cylindric algebras does not have a right adjoint, while that of polyadic algebras is an equivalence. We relate this categorial result to several amalgamation properties for classes of representable algebras. We show that the variety of cylindric algebras of infinite dimension, endowed with the merry go round identities, fails to have the amalgamation property answering a question of Nemeti’s. We also study two variants of the so-called cylindric polyadic algebras introduced by Ferenczi (all are reducts of polyadic equality algebras, that are also varieties). We show that one is more cylindric than polyadic, and that the other is more polyadic than cylindric. Our classification is determined by results on neat embeddings and amalgamation expressed from the point of view of category theory, thereby witnessing, and, indeed, further emphasizing, the dichotomy between the cylindric and polyadic paradigms. For example, the first class does not have the unique neat embedding property, fails to have the amalgamation property and the neat reduct functor does not have a right adjoint, while the second class has the unique neat emdedding property, the superamalgamation property and the neat reduct functor is strongly invertible.

763,"Cybersecurity threats are on the rise with evermore digitization of the information that many day-to-day systems depend upon. The demand for cybersecurity analysts outpaces supply, which calls for optimal management of the analyst resource. Therefore, a key component of the cybersecurity defense system is the optimal scheduling of its analysts. Sensor data is analyzed by automatic processing systems, and alerts are generated. A portion of these alerts is considered to be  significant , which requires thorough examination by a cybersecurity analyst. Risk, in this article, is defined as the percentage of unanalyzed or not thoroughly analyzed alerts among the  significant  alerts by analysts. The article presents a generalized optimization model for scheduling cybersecurity analysts to minimize risk (a.k.a., maximize  significant  alert coverage by analysts) and maintain risk under a pre-determined upper bound. The article tests the optimization model and its scalability on a set of given sensors with varying analyst experiences, alert generation rates, system constraints, and system requirements. Results indicate that the optimization model is scalable and is capable of identifying both the right mix of analyst expertise in an organization and the sensor-to-analyst allocation in order to maintain risk below a given upper bound. Several meta-principles are presented, which are derived from the optimization model, and they further serve as guiding principles for hiring and scheduling cybersecurity analysts. The simulation studies (validation) of the optimization model outputs indicate that risk varies non-linearly with an analyst/sensor ratio, and for a given analyst/sensor ratio, the risk is independent of the number of sensors in the system.","['Rajesh Ganesan', 'Sushil Jajodia', 'Hasan Cam']",3cb4b989-a447-4347-8cda-9bc116508e05,50,"['1de3718f-6c2b-4538-bf3f-b9b787ea6289', '2b9e09ea-0c2e-475a-a143-7c9bdb58fa35', '45b035d3-332b-4e05-838c-cc0f69b03697', '4b028326-7d16-4e6e-abac-4665c6738c06', '6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3', '7f84b1f7-1ff8-456f-a8a4-8a448db9578f', 'a4075de5-5e0c-4d78-8357-737e78f81314', 'a59be9de-2672-4f92-8ff6-636b3afbce68', 'b869c67e-3995-4843-8ebf-c63c0e7e6013', 'c8b6747b-8b67-45b6-b762-5c500bdd83d1']",Optimal Scheduling of Cybersecurity Analysts for Minimizing Risk,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,2017
764,"In this paper, we introduce low-complexity multidimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT) approximations. 3D DCT approximations are formalized in terms of high-order tensor theory. The formulation is extended to higher dimensions with arbitrary lengths. Several multiplierless    $8\times 8 \times 8$    approximate methods are proposed and the computational complexity is discussed for the general multidimensional case. The proposed methods complexity cost was assessed, presenting considerably lower arithmetic operations when compared with the exact 3D DCT. The proposed approximations were embedded into 3D DCT-based video coding scheme and a modified quantization step was introduced. The simulation results showed that the approximate 3D DCT coding methods offer almost identical output visual quality when compared with exact 3D DCT scheme. The proposed 3D approximations were also employed as a tool for visual tracking. The approximate 3D DCT-based proposed system performs similarly to the original exact 3D DCT-based method. In general, the suggested methods showed competitive performance at a considerably lower computational cost.","['Vítor de A. Coutinho', 'Renato J. Cintra', 'Fábio M.

766,"This paper deals with the forward-looking imaging problem under high-speed platform for the airborne single-channel forward-looking radar (ASFLR). Biphase-based synthetic bandwidth azimuth modulation imaging radar (Bi-SBAMIR) can be used to increase the azimuth resolution. However, the performance degrades significantly when the velocity of the platform is high. To solve this problem, a more generalized SBAMIR framework based on linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveform (LFM-SBAMIR) is proposed. The LFM waveform is more Doppler tolerant than the biphase waveform, which makes it a good choice for high speed platform. In LFM-SBAMIR, the synthetic bandwidth of the received signal has two parts: the modulation bandwidth and the Doppler bandwidth. Therefore, large synthetic bandwidth can be achieved by increasing the modulation bandwidth even in the case of small Doppler bandwidth, and high azimuth resolution can be achieved after matched filtering. Moreover, it is firstly proved that the azimuth resolution is proportional to the time bandwidth product (TBP) of the modulated LFM waveform. Finally, the azimuth resolution performance under different TBPs, SNRs and velocities are analyzed. The performance assessment conducted by resorting to simulated data, also in comparison to the previously proposed Bi-SBAMIR method, has confirmed the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm in high-speed platform scenarios.","['Hongmeng Chen', 'Yaobing Lu', 'Heqiang Mu', 'Xiaoli Yi', 'Jing Liu', 'Zeyu Wang', 'Ming Li', 'Yan Wu']",6e0b503a-8f73-494a-9f81-caea113636b0,0,"['2718b603-620d-4284-a131-02ccdfddf277', '2f4b5681-ed3e-4a6b-b8f3-0e05ff23568d', '66c07c9f-b59e-45ba-a2c1-d13df93376d6', '758c8184-c92e-416b-a9a1-fd906ffe0aaf', '86f390f5-f58f-44e6-b29a-4a1fc870b21b', '90b4711c-34f7-4e85-8fda-0728e06ec9c6', 'c7fc17d0-3ae5-43ba-a267-632c4b77ea52', 'e6d8580d-b2be-4c87-9133-3b65f7ef410e']",Efficient forward-looking imaging via synthetic bandwidth azimuth modulation imaging radar for high-speed platform ☆,Signal Processing,2017

768,"Low-rank matrix decomposition and kernel learning are two useful techniques in building advanced learning systems. Low-rank decomposition can greatly reduce the computational cost of manipulating large kernel matrices. However, existing approaches are mostly unsupervised and do not incorporate side information such as class labels, making the decomposition less effective for a specific learning task. On the other hand, kernel learning techniques aim at constructing kernel matrices whose structure is well aligned with the learning target, which improves the generalization performance of kernel methods. However, most kernel learning approaches are computationally very expensive. To obtain the advantages of both techniques and address their limitations, in this paper we propose a novel kernel low-rank decomposition formulation called the generalized Nystrom method. Our approach inherits the linear time and space complexity via matrix decomposition, while at the same time fully exploits (partial) label information in computing task-dependent decomposition. In addition, the resultant low-rank factors can generalize to arbitrary new samples, rendering great flexibility in inductive learning scenarios. We further extend the algorithm to a multiple kernel learning setup. The experimental results on semi-supervised classification demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.","['Liang Lan', 'Kai Zhang', 'Hancheng Ge', 'Wei Cheng', 'Jun Liu', 'Andreas Rauber', 'Xiaoli Li', 'Jun Wang', 'Hongyuan Zha']",d60db849-166a-4a43-89f1-03d32f911458,0,"['07d74df6-830d-4b7a-bd9a-a54dabe1ae29', '0df33660-1849-4adf-9af3-5d3d8ebee840', '0e7ad35b-c1c3-43e4-a125-a01415f6efcb', '0ec31645-608f-4341-8e5e-cae7eb7eec4f', '0fd6d1c2-bc26-47cc-a11a-b64151b63b4c', '10ef551a-2362-4bf3-afc2-d582c47ec59e', '1c9835fa-b489-4316-ab24-a915887b9b69', '1eb6e894-caa8-4078-9bbe-41125a464c06', '216f96d1-a72e-4958-a866-cc2761771057', '2f3c1f28-db7e-4399-ba30-6b8fb1377318', '31e6f2dc-5e3b-4edb-819e-d81ac73626e1', '38950e26-505a-4d95-850d-b855a16e21e9', '3c13a267-57c7-4079-bb10-1078184e8c64', '40552b91-8a96-4519-9972-8c264bc6b70c', '4cbd7765-c47a-4004-a5f8-c2da7c7d1c7b', '4d05f2cc-528e-46df-852d-c16d7edc48f7', '53d3454b-dad3-4237-a5c9-298a7039031c', '68914053-edda-4172-8708-adfcec1bd3b1', '6ae92303-837c-4dc5-8d46-dc1e4d66ca3d', '71d07b9d-6220-4acd-93e1-cc71f8ff714a', '807b8ea8-a82a-46ae-87d4-387ea795fa7a', '846d232e-f9d4-44dc-b82e-ef5c3602fa21', '8c0ec27c-e654-4e0e-8c49-9b427117a98e', '8d649995-283f-4cf4-9250-aafd716cb2ac', '8dacb95e-ec6f-40a8-bc7d-3c5b1a524455', '99729169-c6b2-43cc-97fa-dd7c91361fc6', '9c2ed18d-2a96-48f2-ab3c-49b67a88f218', 'a5d31c22-bdb4-4f0d-ab7b-4af2a8e37b9c', 'a5e3c7d4-bdc9-46e9-9ebd-044328488842', 'b696079c-9adf-4f39-aa92-d85f2bc823c5', 'b80cff78-c330-4faf-b724-f7d704f6e48d', 'bc41219a-ae7f-42da-84ef-9c862c991cf9', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'c30ad1b7-6797-41ab-8a00-95cdf6f4655b', 'c8412302-e614-4e9b-a4cb-5100017be29f', 'd8c1674f-7d37-4634-8935-5c1129687597', 'd90e73b5-7a93-4abc-b7b5-c301f4e7b080', 'd9bed384-14fb-4766-8b03-228964eb70e7', 'f6ff7576-3c1a-40d4-a518-1f8300d7a976', 'f70b9a91-f4cd-453a-9e31-1f9d4918f949']",Low-rank decomposition meets kernel learning: A generalized Nyström method,Artificial Intelligence,2017

771,"Based on the V-BLAST zero-padded block transmission scheme in the frequency-selective multiple-input multiple-output channels, we propose a two-stage lattice-reduction (LR)-aided decoder and prove analytically that it can achieve the maximum diversity gain, which is equal to the product of the number of receive-antennas and the number of multipath channel taps. In the proposed decoding method, at first, we decouple the detection problem into several reduced-size detection problems and perform the lattice reduction algorithm for the decoupled blocks. Then, by choosing a proper threshold, a clustering algorithm divides the blocks into the maximum two clusters. We prove that the corresponding blocks of the first cluster achieve the full diversity through their linear equalization. For the remainder of the blocks, based on the entire observations of the second cluster, we propose an LR-aided detection method, which decodes the information symbols in this cluster with full diversity. Our proposed two-stage LR-aided algorithm performs better than the conventional LR-aided detection in terms of both the decoding computational complexity and the error probability. Additionally, we prove analytically that at high signal-to-noise ratio, the decoding complexity of the proposed decoder is equal to that of decoding the first cluster.","['Mehrdad Niroomand', 'Mostafa Derakhtian']",6850e535-bddc-4d8a-8e68-6b8b480116f3,0,"['01bb95b7-ac80-44b1-a6f9-55249e0b3807', '2eae3519-2aa0-41f1-ad0e-b3be7c3ceb2f', '2efe4e17-5d2d-411c-90d8-d2da39fb2a5c', '3a0d56e5-e6db-46df-9052-51ed4631bfce', '49fbb371-0686-43d3-9a29-444fe8840891', '4ff033ba-9e0a-4650-8c2e-8d90de6293d9', '657a218b-9d5f-4a78-98c6-d3f5a4224c71', '6c5e3316-ae65-48a9-806c-1dd538b8f14b', '7d25d2f0-8706-463d-a750-30c1e9018e7d', '8e62ac51-73e6-4c98-98e8-1e8e9845c809', '91f1068b-9feb-4799-b920-67205c36999b', 'a31b40fc-aacd-4708-8930-30058b819d63', 'd1ff60c5-0b5b-4ae1-af49-07a5682dfb29', 'd4bdab8b-f801-495e-920c-5d2367ec906a', 'dea0718b-0b1d-4561-813f-bfa17da9a1c7', 'e7b8b6a7-3fd7-4e12-8806-452129a0b391', 'f0ac9c88-8298-4c4d-8c1c-bb0e0e6b43f7', 'f150933d-d5e6-49a5-8071-3a9f7e3a497c']",A Low Complexity Diversity Achieving Decoder Based on a Two-Stage Lattice Reduction in Frequency-Selective MIMO Channels,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2017
772,"We have investigated the scenarios of transition to chaos in the mathematical model of a genetic system constituted by a single transcription factor-encoding gene, the expression of which is self-regulated by a feedback loop that involves protein isoforms. Alternative splicing results in the synthesis of protein isoforms providing opposite regulatory outcomes — activation or repression. The model is represented by a differential equation with two delayed arguments. The possibility of transition to chaos dynamics via all classical scenarios: a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations, quasiperiodicity and type-I, type-II and type-III intermittencies, has been numerically demonstrated. The parametric features of each type of transition to chaos have been described.","['Vladislav V. Kogai', 'Vitaly A. Likhoshvai', 'S. I. Fadeev', 'Tamara M.

773,"A data deficit in shallow groundwater monitoring in Africa exists despite one million handpumps being used by 200 million people every day. Recent advances with “smart handpumps” have provided accelerometry data sent automatically by SMS from transmitters inserted in handles to estimate hourly water usage. Exploiting the high-frequency “noise” in handpump accelerometry data, we model high-rate wave forms using robust machine learning techniques sensitive to the subtle interaction between pumping action and groundwater depth. We compare three methods for representing accelerometry data (wavelets, splines, Gaussian processes) with two systems for estimating groundwater depth (support vector regression, Gaussian process regression), and apply three systems to evaluate the results (held-out periods, held-out recordings, balanced datasets). Results indicate that the method using splines and support vector regression provides the lowest overall errors. We discuss further testing and the potential of using Africa's accidental infrastructure to harmonise groundwater monitoring systems with rural water-security goals.","['Farah E.

774,"In lossy wireless sensor networks, many links suffer from significant quality variation with time and environments. Topology control approaches need to consider such stochastic nature to yield different topologies for different application requirements. However, the metric of links must be timely obtained to speed up the topology construction. In fact, the existing approaches address it by passive monitoring, which is not timely adaptive to link quality variation. Also, timely access to the metric of all links at all power levels causes a large burden on topology control operation. We do not insist on getting the link metrics of all power levels at a time. Most urgently needed link metrics are firstly obtained by an active probing mode in this paper. If these link metrics do not meet the topology performance requirements, sub-urgently needed link metrics will be obtained on demand. At the same time, each node performs a topology control process based on the information in a smaller range (e.g., 1-hop neighborhood). Therefore, our approach has the low construct cast, which is proved in this paper. The simulation results also show that our approach outperforms the existing typical works in terms of average transmission power level, though it is slightly less efficient in terms of average delivery rate, average end-to-end delay and total energy consumption. In addition, our approach has advantage in terms of standard deviation of remaining energy under the relatively smaller required path quality bound or lower node density.","['Jinsong Gui', 'Jian Deng']",e52f2dfd-e211-4f1e-b092-2023251aeb60,0,"['08c6c985-93ee-409c-b0f4-fa726cc05ec3', '11fb2270-1118-4956-b8f6-1eaebe63e89c', '1999942d-3609-4ac4-8db4-61305240f723', '1a3a157e-cddc-4298-afb6-873bc7d9d394', '21aa9037-a274-4ebc-87a6-e1deaf8fe04d', '21c6d8ec-a7dd-4dbd-88c1-89dbb0d9189a', '25d98d18-5850-4077-a36c-2296bb292c9e', '314c5a50-5eb8-4377-9861-e4367ff86462', '38b10094-82ce-4476-8845-d4e8d027942a', '38e79a77-5bee-4bea-820b-c2ed7fb1e3de', '48ebdf3a-503b-48b9-886f-03a91a87da78', '76b2fb00-118a-4ee9-b49a-47b43a05f73a', '7e91ea71-d9be-4495-a0d3-b1c7380a6a6d', '8742b527-28c5-45bf-bbb2-8324400fa5ca', '933579d8-359f-402a-ae25-0cef133728cb', '9dfc2115-597c-48eb-aefb-f8578b6081ff', 'b2300c4b-7fd1-40c6-8263-3b13a029840c', 'b4afe508-7c8c-426a-9bc0-dca41cff459c', 'b684bdac-08c9-45e7-949e-baaaf2afa933', 'c1f88663-49f0-4c55-a0ef-9fdae48b7f85', 'cc62f28c-544c-4845-a1f8-95ba363bbc66', 'd044c9cb-6cf4-4738-a33e-f254893ad680', 'd113a979-a908-4bc4-9a1d-612e50064c42', 'd4c1d840-98e5-4a54-ab78-595d3d31defc', 'dff9d6cf-8f6d-479b-954b-73f88f20c254', 'e1fa2c40-8222-4044-9440-65fbd3219836', 'e2a33e32-65df-434d-9949-1d6463249bca', 'e542384e-690a-4865-acb5-bed6632f1075', 'f19d72ce-6bf8-4ab0-acaa-9de9d8085324', 'f682f022-3c5c-4638-a9d4-5b08bfa136a1', 'fc8e6731-677b-418f-9aa4-6e6dbd72d907', 'fe37462a-9c1e-412e-adb6-003a95d4c3b1']",A Topology Control Approach Reducing Construction Cost for Lossy Wireless Sensor Networks,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

We show that a deformable part model can be learned with the proposed structured SVM neural network by backpropagating the error of the deformable part model to the convolutional neural network. The forward propagation calculates the loss augmented inference and the backpropagation calculates the gradient from the loss augmented inference layer to the convolutional layer. Thus, we obtain a new type of convolutional neural network called an Structured SVM convolutional neural network, which we applied to the human pose estimation problem.

776,"In this paper a new associative classification algorithm is presented. The proposed algorithm overcomes the limitations of the original Alpha-Beta associative memory, while maintaining the fundamental set recalling capacity. This algorithm has two phases. The first phase is based on an Alpha-Beta auto-associative memory, which works in the domain of real numbers, unlike the traditional Alpha-Beta associative memories. In the second phase, normalized difference between the results of first phase and every pattern of the fundamental set is calculated. In order to demonstrate the behaviour and accuracy of the algorithm, multiple well known datasets and classification algorithms have been used.

777,"A robust high-order scheme for the multi-phase flow computations featuring jumps and discontinuities due to shock waves and phase interfaces is presented. The scheme is based on high-order weighted-essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) finite volume schemes and high-order limiters to ensure the maximum principle or positivity of the various field variables including the density, pressure, and order parameters identifying each phase. The two-phase flow model considered besides the Euler equations of gas dynamics consists of advection of two parameters of the stiffened-gas equation of states, characterizing each phase. The design of the high-order limiter is guided by the findings of Zhang and Shu (2011)   [36]  , and is based on limiting the quadrature values of the density, pressure and order parameters reconstructed using a high-order WENO scheme. The proof of positivity-preserving and accuracy is given, and the convergence and the robustness of the scheme are illustrated using the smooth isentropic vortex problem with very small density and pressure. The effectiveness and robustness of the scheme in computing the challenging problem of shock wave interaction with a cluster of tightly packed air or helium bubbles placed in a body of liquid water is also demonstrated. The superior performance of the high-order schemes over the first-order Lax-Friedrichs scheme for computations of shock-bubble interaction is also shown. The scheme is implemented in two-dimensional space on parallel computers using message passing interface (MPI). The proposed scheme with limiter features approximately   50%     50  %        higher number of inter-processor message communications compared to the corresponding scheme without limiter, but with only   10%     10  %        higher total CPU time.

778,"Wetland biomass is essential for monitoring the stability and productivity of wetland ecosystems. Conventional field methods to measure or estimate wetland biomass are accurate and reliable, but expensive, time consuming and labor intensive. This research explored the potential for estimating wetland reed biomass using a combination of airborne discrete-return Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral data. To derive the optimal predictor variables of reed biomass, a range of LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics at different spatial scales were regressed against the field-observed biomasses. The results showed that the LiDAR-derived H_p99 (99th percentile of the LiDAR height) and hyperspectral-calculated modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) were the best metrics for estimating reed biomass using the single regression model. Although the LiDAR data yielded a higher estimation accuracy compared to the hyperspectral data, the combination of LiDAR and hyperspectral data produced a more accurate prediction model for reed biomass (R2 = 0.648, RMSE = 167.546 g/m2, RMSEr = 20.71%) than LiDAR data alone. Thus, combining LiDAR data with hyperspectral data has a great potential for improving the accuracy of aboveground biomass estimation.","['Shezhou Luo', 'Cheng Wang', 'Xiaohuan Xi', 'Feifei Pan', 'Mingjie Qian', 'Dailiang Peng', 'Sheng Nie', 'Haiming Qin', 'Yi Lin']",104012c6-9fe3-4309-8b6f-24e57618a415,0,"['104d29db-37c0-4240-971f-c6516f330460', '4aa2dca6-a06d-4d75-9e12-aa68fbe29cf1', '56f178cd-a972-4dfc-9797-f7448a0a333c', '636721b3-a1a0-49cb-9ec9-fd17581c2b3b', '6ada6a96-aa44-4b8d-bb67-55436a28d690', '7afb87b2-87cb-478b-a8c3-b00e2a7c8ade', 'c17f9ee3-e84f-478e-afaa-e25346758aea', 'c65fdaaf-ed8c-4c77-829a-afa79097c3b4', 'ccd49e85-61ea-46e9-a0af-64e516e07334', 'd6197c60-e869-4606-a148-c93d3e8135d0', 'fa08986c-d884-4ec7-a0aa-b6075ae080af', 'feedcf33-e949-42d7-83a9-b612d6b55c50', 'ffc23f47-efbe-4417-9d6c-5b15aca32925']",Retrieving aboveground biomass of wetland Phragmites australis (common reed) using a combination of airborne discrete-return LiDAR and hyperspectral data,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2017

A sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the exponential synchronization by employing the special Lyapunov stability analysis method, which by combining the difference and differential of the Lyapunov function rather than the single difference or differential. The main advantage of this paper is to avoid continuous communication between network nodes, which can decrease the number of information updates, reduce the network congestion and avoid the waste of network resources. Moreover, the Zeno behavior is excluded as well by the strictly positive sampling intervals.

780,"Based on the Petri net models of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs), this paper focuses on deadlock-free scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the makespan. Two hybrid heuristic search algorithms for solving such scheduling problems of FMSs are proposed. To avoid deadlocks, the deadlock control policy is embedded into heuristic search strategies. The proposed algorithms combine the heuristic best-first strategy with the controlled backtracking strategy based on the execution of the Petri nets. The scheduling problem is transformed into a heuristic search problem in the reachability graph of the Petri net, and a schedule is a transition sequence from the initial marking to the final marking in the reachability graph. By using the one-step look-ahead method in the deadlock control policy, the safety of a state in the reachability graph is checked, and hence, deadlock is avoided. Experimental results are provided and indicate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid heuristic search algorithms in solving deadlock-free scheduling problems of FMSs. Especially, the comparison against previous work shows that both new algorithms are promising in terms of solution quality and computing times.","['Hang Lei', 'Keyi Xing', 'Libin Han', 'Zhenxin Gao']",3cfbc7d5-c0ed-45d2-a818-51230a45994f,50,"['275adabd-7884-42bb-99bd-f358b9612c58', '2baf7ff3-0a11-4b89-8e80-d804ffb271e8', '2e55f050-8dc6-4863-b50a-c06150f1126f', '2eb631e0-12e1-42fd-bd0f-1b9b43060136', '61be64a0-58e1-4159-8442-1a512958f300', '65667301-29cb-4ced-a287-8667c883968a', '6e9d2995-e197-43e8-9b91-2568b179864a', '6ed8a8e7-ef31-465c-a0a9-b40f4a49d326', '78e52d1a-4749-42ac-8a20-07e0c1649f4a', '8052547b-8b78-49c9-9acc-33631dcfd51f', '83359201-f6d5-4572-97df-c06380267aa1', '86e2b25c-ebeb-4155-8f50-c293551040f6', '97219fee-ec6e-4d2a-b7d1-a2e881c130d0', 'a3a60cdf-dd86-4cca-b383-a92413559a17', 'aab36794-55e7-4081-9961-417d8964bd6b', 'bef0bc77-4f38-40fc-8b4f-9a97d9616eef', 'cc2e98b6-dd54-41ca-b47c-9304d5cf170e', 'df86c773-8692-412b-b941-3281aeee4cf8', 'e213ceb0-3fa5-42c4-b3b1-06ad29192a79', 'e8fbdd59-ccee-4781-8cb9-db0de4362d4e']",Hybrid heuristic search approach for deadlock-free scheduling of flexible manufacturing systems using Petri nets,Applied Soft Computing,2017
781,"This paper presents a cooperative, combinatorial search model for a multi-mobile sensor, multi-mobile target scenario in a two dimensional grid space. In the proposed model, sensors and targets act as searchers and hiders of a search game. A search game is a game between searcher and hider, modeled on a graph. In this paper, the identified problem states that multiple targets enter into a grid from the same or different sides and try to exit on the opposite directions of their respective entry sides. Alternatively, multiple mobile sensors are randomly deployed in the grid and try to maximize the number of target searched and to minimize search time before the targets leave the grid. This problem fits into several real life scenarios such as international border security, terrorist searching in a specified area, finding spies etc. The novelty of the proposed model is interpreting the problem as a search game and formulating strategies for the mobile sensors to optimize their moves to maximize the number of target searched and minimize search time. In this paper, shortest path and random walk strategies for the targets are analyzed by applying suitable mathematical models and on the other hand, advantages of cooperative over non-cooperative strategies for the mobile sensors are also shown with the help of analytical methods and simulation results. The significant mathematical concepts applied in the proposed model are as follows-computing shortest path, random walk, Markov chain, probability graph, overlapping of multiple probability graphs, cooperative and non-cooperative strategies etc.","['Tanmoy Hazra', 'Manisha J.

Well-designed campaigns are raising awareness to the problem and an increasing number of smokers seeks medical assistance to quit their habit. In this context, there is the need to develop mHealth Apps that assist and manage large smoke quitting programs in efficient and economic ways.#R##N#Objectives#R##N#Our main objective is to develop an efficient and free mHealth app that facilitates the management of, and assistance to, people who want to quit smoking. As secondary objectives, our research also aims at estimating the economic effect of deploying that App in the public health system.#R##N#Methods#R##N#Using JAVA and XML we develop and deploy a new free mHealth App for Android, called TControl (Tobacco-quitting Control). We deploy the App at the Tobacco Unit of the Santa Maria Hospital in Lleida and determine its stability by following the crashes of the App. We also use a survey to test usability of the app and differences in aptitude for using the App in a sample of 31 patients. Finally, we use mathematical models to estimate the economic effect of deploying TControl in the Catalan public health system.#R##N#Results#R##N#TControl keeps track of the smoke-quitting users, tracking their status, interpreting it, and offering advice and psychological support messages. The App also provides a bidirectional communication channel between patients and clinicians via mobile text messages. Additionally, registered patients have the option to interchange experiences with each other by chat. The App was found to be stable and to have high performances during startup and message sending. Our results suggest that age and gender have no statistically significant effect on patient aptitude for using TControl. Finally, we estimate that TControl could reduce costs for the Catalan public health system (CPHS) by up to € 400M in 10 years.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#TControl is a stable and well behaved App, typically operating near optimal performance. It can be used independent of age and gender, and its wide implementation could decrease costs for the public health system.","['Pifarré M', 'Carrera A', 'Jordi Vilaplana', 'Josep Cuadrado', 'Sara Solsona', 'Francesc Abella', 'Francesc Solsona', 'Rui Alves']",4bb3701d-f4c7-45b6-8f5a-cb64e45010e0,0,"['98a50519-7ac1-4905-8df3-9b7d4c5b067c', 'ec9afd36-9780-4c44-abdc-af7a02b4c8a0']",TControl: A mobile app to follow up tobacco-quitting patients,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,2017
783,"Taking the ‘path perspective’ helps to understand and improve the practice of environmental modelling and decision making. A path is the sequence of steps taken in a modelling project. The problem solving team faces several forks where alternative choices can be made. These choices determine the path, together with the impact of uncertainties and exogenous effects. This paper discusses phenomena that influence the problem solvers' choices at the forks. Situations are described where it can be desirable to re-direct the path or backtrack on it. Phenomena are identified that can cause the modelling project to get stuck on a poor path. The concept of a path draws attention to the interplay of behavioral phenomena and the sequential nature of modelling processes. This helps understand the overall effect of the behavioral phenomena. A path checklist is developed to help practitioners detect forks and reflect on the path of the modelling project.","['Tuomas J. Lahtinen', 'Joseph Guillaume', 'Raimo P.

Upper bounds for the correlation functions of all orders are also obtained for both long and short dispersals, and for all values of the intrinsic mortality rate.","['Yuri Kondratiev', 'Yuri Kozitsky']",97f26c21-24aa-4935-b8c7-cf18d9140dd5,0,[],Self-regulation in the Bolker-Pacala model,Applied Mathematics Letters,2017
786,"Thousands of changes are applied to SNOMED CT’s concepts during each release cycle. These changes are the result of efforts to improve or expand the coverage of health domains in the terminology. Understanding which concepts changed, how they changed, and the overall impact of a set of changes is important for editors and end users. Each SNOMED CT release comes with delta files, which identify all of the individual additions and removals of concepts and relationships. These files typically contain tens of thousands of individual entries, overwhelming users. They also do not identify the editorial processes that were applied to individual concepts and they do not capture the overall impact of a set of changes on a subhierarchy of concepts.#R##N##R##N#In this paper we introduce a methodology and accompanying software tool called a SNOMED CT Visual Semantic Delta (“semantic delta” for short) to enable a comprehensive review of changes in SNOMED CT. The semantic delta displays a graphical list of editing operations that provides semantics and context to the additions and removals in the delta files. However, there may still be thousands of editing operations applied to a set of concepts. To address this issue, a semantic delta includes a visual summary of changes that affected sets of structurally and semantically similar concepts. The software tool for creating semantic deltas offers views of various granularities, allowing a user to control how much change information they view. In this tool a user can select a set of structurally and semantically similar concepts and review the editing operations that affected their modeling. The semantic delta methodology is demonstrated on SNOMED CT’s Bacterial infectious disease subhierarchy, which has undergone a significant remodeling effort over the last two years.","['Christopher Ochs', 'James T.

787,"Twin support vector machine (TWSVM) is an efficient supervised learning algorithm, proposed for the classification problems. Motivated by its success, we propose Tree-based localized fuzzy twin support vector clustering (Tree-TWSVC). Tree-TWSVC is a novel clustering algorithm that builds the cluster model as a binary tree, where each node comprises of proposed TWSVM-based classifier, termed as localized fuzzy TWSVM (LF-TWSVM). The proposed clustering algorithm Tree-TWSVC has efficient learning time, achieved due to the tree structure and the formulation that leads to solving a series of systems of linear equations. Tree-TWSVC delivers good clustering accuracy because of the square loss function and it uses nearest neighbour graph based initialization method. The proposed algorithm restricts the cluster hyperplane from extending indefinitely by using cluster prototype, which further improves its accuracy. It can efficiently handle large datasets and outperforms other TWSVM-based clustering methods. In this work, we propose two implementations of Tree-TWSVC: Binary Tree-TWSVC and One-against-all Tree-TWSVC. To prove the efficacy of the proposed method, experiments are performed on a number of benchmark UCI datasets. We have also given the application of Tree-TWSVC as an image segmentation tool.","['Reshma Rastogi', 'Pooja Saigal']",1ca8895f-7830-4a53-8bdd-a8fdae00df54,0,"['00b6ebc1-cb9e-4182-9022-9a5a7ab59401', '1017d9d4-9a4c-423d-ad40-6d9bebbd6b31', '21ad867e-f85e-4e3c-a7f2-45ee000dbc88', '339fe409-c75f-4f21-80e4-dd85bf40c2a4', '4f371b4c-9279-4ee5-aabc-8e06893a13d8', '53fbb6c8-153e-49ed-b5fd-964a0d1f1303', '5b460e7c-3c29-4c4d-b679-8ba3766b41ad', '5ce867e9-d690-4bdc-8472-d6331197cbff', '61f73c14-b309-416e-8ea4-1df825865e91', '69db5ada-da30-4768-b722-60a54c2e510f', '6bef3dfe-7a80-43d6-aa36-466c5f8cdb8c', '7033a94a-96c3-4faa-b8da-81fa91b71679', '7c3f444f-8c22-4780-aeac-01b711ecb77a', '8d5a94de-95a6-44f2-823e-5fe4937315a8', 'a9bb2246-1ffd-4802-a236-db1c4083c57e', 'ab6299de-a2a5-4e69-840b-2f5daee94898', 'b33eea94-414c-4232-a1b8-1ffc687c1d61', 'b5873bf6-64f6-4e46-b2fa-375966f5c155', 'bcae3b5c-b8a7-4022-9354-6e0237c777c6', 'd9752a5a-1603-45cc-9a21-7997750d429f', 'e2c78b73-3c63-4bf8-8ac3-25c511b9bac3', 'e7c9f2a5-fb47-43d0-a3ca-6889e4fbde79', 'ea8cd3d8-17ae-4a1e-8f83-1609469087af', 'ed869b16-2abb-4ac8-bb5f-790948d0bd56', 'fb32772d-fac5-46ff-a95a-ac59e84042f6', 'feff8862-f47d-4591-a7cb-b62d7efc81a2']",Tree-based localized fuzzy twin support vector clustering with square loss function,Applied Intelligence,2017
788,"Several studies have examined the relationships between citation and download data. Some have also analyzed disciplinary differences in the relationships by comparing a few subject areas or a few journals. To gain a deeper understanding of the disciplinary differences, we carried out a comprehensive study investigating the issue in five disciplines of science, engineering, medicine, social sciences, and humanities. We used a systematic method to select fields and journals ensuring a very broad spectrum and balanced representation of various academic fields. A total of 69 fields and 150 journals were included. We collected citation and download data for these journals from China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database, the largest Chinese academic journal database in the world. We manually filtered out non-research papers such as book reviews and editorials. We analyzed the relationships both at the journal and the paper level. The study found that social sciences and humanities are different from science, engineering, and medicine and that the pattern of differences are consistent across all measures studied. Social sciences and humanities have higher correlations between citations and downloads, higher correlations between downloads per paper and Journal Impact Factor, and higher download-to-citation ratios. The disciplinary differences mean that the accuracy or utility of download data in measuring the impact are higher in social sciences and humanities and that download data in those disciplines reflect or measure a broader impact, much more than the impact in citing authors.","['Liwen Vaughan', 'Juan Tang', 'Rongbin Yang']",0a276bc9-07c9-469a-88f5-9b359ff08679,0,"['042df96a-0ae2-4e31-b6c7-97fefbdc232e', '0a6d0c2f-934e-487d-9632-b676fb104ec0', '2e02ad45-6cef-4a56-9b11-982f06248321', '320aabcb-de46-4d1f-bc2c-968ddc4141f7', '3c7d1065-8c60-4d3a-85b1-04142ebaf762', '4ab3646e-d5ba-415f-a38e-d547f7c38f86', '8abc1a69-98da-41a5-bf45-c0684dfd1bc2', 'a4a81b73-3470-453f-8576-55e88e47e958', 'b0dd2dc0-1ac5-4ae2-a6c6-40fa1a373f5c', 'bcadc154-1f8b-44b2-8bdb-b21b77b15372', 'cb8a8535-aecd-489b-b49a-58a64e7d1e17', 'd4baf85c-0085-4578-8dec-460b6f363cda', 'e676a97e-ed78-43a5-96ac-e15b7ea5816b', 'f13ccdc9-9cf1-4241-8522-345b21cb5312']",Investigating disciplinary differences in the relationships between citations and downloads,Scientometrics,2017
789,"The mirrored aperture synthesis radiometer (MASR) has been proposed as a new technique for high-resolution observation. Compared with ASRs, MASRs have the advantage of lower system complexity. However, the relationship between MASRs and ASRs has not been studied. In order to thoroughly study MASRs, it is necessary to establish the relationship between MASRs and ASRs. In this letter, the array factor of 1-D MASRs in the discrete cosine transform domain (DCT-domain) is defined. The reconstructed image for a 1-D MASR is a symmetric convolution of the observed brightness temperature distribution and the defined array factor in the DCT domain. Since a symmetric convolution can be turned into a linear convolution, the relationship between 1-D MASRs and 1-D ASRs can be established. A 1-D MASR is equivalent to a 1-D ASR that has a mirrored window. Additionally, for the equivalent 1-D ASR, its observed scene is a symmetrically extended real scene. This established relationship is validated by the simulation results. In practical applications, a MASR can be understood as an ASR.","['Yufang Li', 'Qingxia Li', 'Li Feng']",f7f183f6-4e70-4105-b742-aeab78f4c6ff,0,"['1a359ea5-5cd1-44f5-bac7-62e9f0535498', '37e05bb7-acda-4152-b8aa-1178554bfb74', '43813d18-a606-40e9-bc92-9a6d0dad7af4', '6ea8c7ce-9c41-467c-a475-607d0d53980f', '84054583-75fa-41e5-8de0-2ac1bc102b39', '8b81646d-80ca-46cd-88aa-0b0a4c6f0749', '8fdad8ab-cba2-4021-949d-6fad5249b868', 'ed653c4a-5ab2-44c6-ab0c-435346b9da93', 'fdf2e645-ebc4-44b8-87d2-26c3ea25872d']",Relationship Between Mirrored Aperture Synthesis Radiometers and Aperture Synthesis Radiometers,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017

799,"Alternative gene splicing is a common phenomenon in which a single gene gives rise to multiple transcript isoforms. The process is strictly guided and involves a multitude of proteins and regulatory complexes. Unfortunately, aberrant splicing events do occur which have been linked to genetic disorders, such as several types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Fan et al., Theor Biol Med Model 3:19, 2006). Therefore, understanding the mechanism of alternative splicing and identifying the difference in splicing events between diseased and healthy tissue is crucial in biomedical research with the potential of applications in personalized medicine as well as in drug development. We propose a linear mixed model, Random Effects for the Identification of Differential Splicing (REIDS), for the identification of alternative splicing events. Based on a set of scores, an exon score and an array score, a decision regarding alternative splicing can be made. The model enables the ability to distinguish a differential expressed gene from a differential spliced exon. The proposed model was applied to three case studies concerning both exon and HTA arrays. The REIDS model provides a work flow for the identification of alternative splicing events relying on the established linear mixed model. The model can be applied to different types of arrays.","['Marijke Van Moerbeke', 'Adetayo Kasim', 'Willem Talloen', 'Joke Reumers', 'Hinrick W. H.

800,"Arbitrary tracking is hard due to nonstop intrinsic and extrinsic variations in realistic scenarios. Even for the popular tracking-by-learning strategies, effective appearance modeling of the non-rigid objects is still challenging because of the targets’ articulatory deformations on-the-fly, which may heavily degrade the discriminative capability of the online generated visual features. With widely emerged deep learning showing its success for feature extraction in different recognition tasks, more and more deep models such as CNN have been demonstrated contributive to improving the performance of online tracking. However, only depending on the outputs from last layer of CNN is not an optimum representation since the coarse spatial resolution cannot guarantee an accurate localization for a qualified sampling process, especially when objects have severe deformations, sampling from the region with a pre-defined scale would inevitably guide a poor online learning. To overcome such a limitation of CNN based tracking, in this work, we incorporated spatial-temporal saliency detection to guide a more accurate target localization for qualified sampling within an inter-frame motion flow map. With an optional strategy for the output combination of intra-frame appearance correlations and inter-frame motion saliency based on a compositional energy optimization, the proposed tracking has shown a superior performance in comparison to the other state-of-art trackers on both challenging non-rigid and generic tracking benchmark datasets.","['Peng Zhang', 'Tao Zhuo', 'Wei Huang', 'Kangli Chen', 'Mohan S.

801,"The stress fibers are prominent organization of actin filaments that perform important functions in cellular processes such as migration, polarization, and traction force generation, and whose collective organization reflects the physiological and mechanical activities of the cells. Easily visualized by fluorescence microscopy, the stress fibers are widely used as qualitative descriptors of cell phenotypes. However, due to the complexity of the stress fibers and the presence of other actin-containing cellular features, images of stress fibers are relatively challenging to quantitatively analyze using previously developed approaches, requiring significant user intervention. This poses a challenge for the automation of their detection, segmentation, and quantitative analysis. Here we describe an open-source software package, SFEX (Stress Fiber Extractor), which is geared for efficient enhancement, segmentation, and analysis of actin stress fibers in adherent tissue culture cells. Our method made use of a carefully chosen image filtering technique to enhance filamentous structures, effectively facilitating the detection and segmentation of stress fibers by binary thresholding. We subdivided the skeletons of stress fiber traces into piecewise-linear fragments, and used a set of geometric criteria to reconstruct the stress fiber networks by pairing appropriate fiber fragments. Our strategy enables the trajectory of a majority of stress fibers within the cells to be comprehensively extracted. We also present a method for quantifying the dimensions of the stress fibers using an image gradient-based approach. We determine the optimal parameter space using sensitivity analysis, and demonstrate the utility of our approach by analyzing actin stress fibers in cells cultured on various micropattern substrates. We present an open-source graphically-interfaced computational tool for the extraction and quantification of stress fibers in adherent cells with minimal user input. This facilitates the automated extraction of actin stress fibers from fluorescence images. We highlight their potential uses by analyzing images of cells with shapes constrained by fibronectin micropatterns. The method we reported here could serve as the first step in the detection and characterization of the spatial properties of actin stress fibers to enable further detailed morphological analysis.","['Zhen Zhang', 'Shumin Xia', 'Pakorn Kanchanawong']",c7b4977e-97b8-4843-991a-a59a2f19efc0,0,"['1e27290a-11e2-4885-8b1b-870f4d2e4334', '39022aa3-8d9d-43d3-b260-6e1a06fd61f3', '3de07622-4f07-43e1-9215-d6f80e8de520', '512e76a4-c2df-40b8-9bda-0535f92d498a', '6f189d9d-1693-4aab-82f9-8afbb05fd1fe', '7808257b-c850-4e96-a187-32974612301e', '9e529ba9-63b3-42b8-9552-a6579baf6d37', '9ffb0d18-a95a-4ffd-b7aa-801d860baec4', 'b616baee-3ff4-4edd-a59e-834a2f343ebb', 'b781c748-81b9-48a4-8984-874988dcae07', 'c68f4f6f-e297-42d9-b101-af8882adb040', 'e063cf80-8c5c-4c8e-86d2-b27e0dc9eae7', 'e0d5d1a7-5c17-418d-ac57-a32ec0536f69']",An integrated enhancement and reconstruction strategy for the quantitative extraction of actin stress fibers from fluorescence micrographs,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
802,"Metric learning has been widely studied in person re-identification (re-id). However, most existing metric learning methods only learn one holistic Mahalanobis distance metric for the concatenated high dimensional feature. This single metric learning strategy cannot handle complex nonlinear data structure and may easily encounter overfitting. Besides, feature concatenation is incapable of exploring the discriminant capability of different features and low dimensional features tend to be dominated by high dimensional ones. Motivated by these problems, we propose a multiple metric learning method for the re-id problem, where individual sub-metrics are separately learned for each feature type and the final metric is formed as weighted sum of the sub-metrics. The sub-metrics are learned with the Cross-view Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (XQDA) algorithm and the weights to each sub-metric are assigned in a two-step procedure. First, the importance of each feature type is estimated according to its discriminative power, which is measured in a query adaptive manner as related to the partial Area Under Curve (pAUC) scores. Then, the weights of all feature types are learned simultaneously with a maximum-margin based multi-task structural SVM learning framework, in order to make sure that relevant gallery images are ranked before irrelevant ones within all feature spaces. Finally, the sub-metrics are integrated with the learned weights in an ensemble model, generating a sophisticated distance metric. Experiments on the challenging i-LIDS, VIPeR, CAVIAR and 3DPeS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","['Jieru Jia', 'Qiuqi Ruan', 'Gaoyun An', 'Yi Jin']",43b33d1b-4250-4c2c-b9a1-07e623eae809,0,"['0036c102-44b1-4edc-a897-8a20f5fe9cdd', '018f1396-aad1-4611-bd18-091a5c0f787f', '06946009-4b1a-431b-94e9-574b0a1c097b', '08bda27c-51a5-472f-b3a9-b44c951e3003', '0abbf63a-ac7c-4c2e-a114-578a716369bc', '0ad94677-a63d-48c6-8cbd-f90e4a807f9e', '106cd86b-923a-42f5-aae6-0e80b8480b19', '1b241dda-86d2-4d63-8746-2d3b64a69dce', '1e9480ad-a7ca-4ef0-8e51-17806b6642b5', '1e94d25c-163f-4d03-af12-031c5f5611e2', '2b3c7021-4a7e-4541-bd89-ebba6b7cfd2e', '33691cc4-a9cc-47cb-bd31-ccafed520bb9', '34e65a4d-00fb-4f50-b149-60bcef877e22', '43026418-4d7b-42ef-86f7-e630a62ed41b', '4697313d-c51e-4edc-9db5-14fb10815017', '47f728b9-85b0-44c4-ab88-b46eb3b88d4d', '4a094e30-3727-4461-836b-3c4d2b7eb7f2', '4c2ef1d4-9837-4239-8b08-0270c1ff0a62', '52a3dfa8-afd8-4d84-af11-c8c50eeb9d2b', '52ecb0b8-d066-463c-8847-ad632c483ca9', '5965ec81-fe04-48a3-b573-f61f80708ea1', '59f4e1e2-484e-42d5-9329-4186a7b447bf', '62f97ca7-2e5c-4766-abad-3c98413e14d7', '63073047-12b4-4704-86a1-3910032b0b8a', '635e578f-e047-4d23-b17f-cda65d475736', '651cecc6-90f0-40f0-9394-dce8fd07f083', '662951e8-93c0-4229-9188-cf8d302a792b', '681f322f-dec4-403b-b94f-911905374937', '81f99650-c53a-4e7a-ba79-723d357eb02c', '83794d9d-1e72-4445-9185-28e9a9208e7b', '86fdcad6-818f-402b-b29a-15c87d2b2bec', '9315b379-a2d8-4fb8-8122-b4fdea0651bb', '936ea7c7-0d10-461a-b7c0-c33c976708b1', '9b5af39b-1c95-4581-9152-bba69d72976b', '9e9230f4-a2cc-4a65-bd29-305cac0cdbe9', 'a1879950-eb22-49eb-98f9-2e07b7a599ec', 'a40032b5-848e-44b9-a1ea-077b245a9f41', 'a5b7db80-940a-48ea-86f6-c8095ce9bde7', 'b457c7ba-7c84-404a-aba7-6283b36c9cf1', 'bbd555c5-1479-4f00-831c-81cfcba4f85f', 'c0394752-0c32-4517-8115-123af83f0848', 'c6ddd5d3-3775-48e2-8a73-79baca92a51f', 'ca9e222c-4a19-4892-bc75-c2bee5cd4899', 'cc73ba17-8aee-4cc7-9e5c-55e36cd0b0ff', 'ce90adda-7c60-451f-a617-78822d4a5ef4', 'd087421a-ac50-468b-8676-d392880ddf85', 'd0bc7d47-c381-450a-becb-fb6923e10f41', 'dec8d213-53ee-41de-a31b-4de60c97a94c', 'e1bc3e1a-3f08-427f-8676-ca67531fc8ec', 'e948c027-a0f7-493d-b468-dd0a4433c0af', 'ea51b41b-2f66-4284-8399-104d25b20146', 'eec0cc91-a820-4f0b-b993-a8b56c7b6b63', 'f0e4288f-4f06-4bd4-8a18-ddd003d2c23e', 'f2806806-326e-4011-9434-65ebbdfe3555', 'f36062af-f993-4ff5-9a4e-487391d3396d', 'fdf34b94-1b50-4af9-a9e5-aa11d2f73575', 'fe822b49-3333-4528-af5d-7e67052d0e57']",Multiple metric learning with query adaptive weights and multi-task re-weighting for person re-identification,Computer Vision and Image Understanding,2017

804,"In this study, optimal pricing and user cooperation schemes are considered in a wireless powered communication network (WPCN), where multiple users harvest energy from a dedicated hybrid access point (HAP, as a power station in the downlink) and transmit their independent information to HAP (as an information receiving station in the uplink) by using the harvested energy. Due to the doubly near-far problem, best cooperation-user selection scheme where the dedicated helping user which is nearer to the H-AP and in general has better channel condition both for DL energy harvesting as well as UL information transmission from source user uses its harvested energy to help forward the source user’s information to H-AP is proposed. Moreover, in the WPCN, the energy is scarce, users have incentive to refuse to cooperate in order to conserve resource. We propose a pricing mechanism to incentivize the helping user to cooperate the uplink transmission. Two transmission protocols for source-user centric and helping-user centric with pricing mechanism are investigated. We formulate the pricing and resource allocation problem as optimization problem and propose efficient algorithms by jointly user-selection and resource allocation to maximize the energy efficient and price-performance ratio. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme with pricing can enhance the source user’s performance with lower cost. Moreover, the pricing mechanisms can incentivize the helping user to cooperate other users’ to decrease the system energy cost.","['Chuanqi Zhu', 'Dingcheng Yang', 'Xue Shen', 'Lin Xiao', 'Laurie Cuthbert']",6f14f94d-8f95-481c-bed9-d5bad79273c1,0,"['13d983ca-54e0-4b26-9991-00b5cad0bf3d', '195f2374-3b2e-442d-b424-86717f98263d', '351d5ab1-40c4-4c98-ad11-eb9615b90c2f', '4806905b-e7c2-4b03-b10c-1e1e2b87c7e1', '4cbf8e90-a4ca-4187-9857-e9bda0220c4e', '857db82c-8ce1-434f-aa1e-a008c863fdb5', '99959966-ad21-4bcb-83f8-10941f1a5f02', 'aeb7ef24-571e-41a2-b415-030f38fe7466', 'b7794f53-dce3-4f59-a87a-63381803fe17', 'f0e9f88a-26f1-4315-bedf-61d2d271d766', 'fcec8609-cd12-4a25-8909-153176f22765', 'ff5c2930-1a38-4ae0-aff7-3dfcb43b33f4']",Optimal Pricing and User Cooperation for Utility-Efficient Wireless Powered Communications,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

Subsection 3.3 illustrates sample calculations and comparisons with other similar methods for neural network evaluation. Finally, section 4 addresses certain implications and outlines future research in pursuit of automated quality analysis of computational techniques. As proposed, the method is effective to compare different computational techniques adequately, with results close to ‘1’ for well-designed networks and results close to ‘0’ for neural networks with possible design flaws. The proposed method is designed for fixed-size, supervised artifical neural networks.","['Ricardo E. Monge', 'Juan L.

807,"This paper analyzes the secure access delegation problem, which occurs naturally in the cloud, and postulate that Proxy Re-Encryption is a feasible cryptographic solution, both from the functional and efficiency perspectives. Proxy re-encryption is a special type of public-key encryption that permits a proxy to transform ciphertexts from one public key to another, without the proxy being able to learn any information about the original message. Thus, it serves as a means for delegating decryption rights, opening up many possible applications that require of delegated access to encrypted data. In particular, sharing information in the cloud is a prime example. In this paper, we review the main proxy re-encryption schemes so far, and provide a detailed analysis of their characteristics. Additionally, we also study the efficiency of selected schemes, both theoretically and empirically, based on our own implementation. Finally, we discuss some applications of proxy re-encryption, with a focus on secure access delegation in the cloud.","['David Nuñez', 'Isaac Agudo', 'Javier Lopez']",cb4decf7-f5a7-465e-a9ac-8380b62e1b5d,0,"['0067011d-0ba8-4987-9aa3-cc4f5fa4f83a', '06566dfb-7602-4720-bf84-4f4994699e1c', '0842f227-fcd9-4a95-b8f9-d15a963ceee1', '0d577f3e-bd5d-4fe8-92ba-6afaecd1dbc8', '0f7713ad-500c-4d26-95f8-29223ad839fd', '14f472f7-3d1e-444c-bee8-fc8aba3bca57', '1db6b94b-24de-413d-b19c-f0b590451c2c', '23d06eb5-a6de-4104-bb43-6f26717b8cc0', '2892d454-4810-4e34-b253-dc2a2015bd37', '28c626b7-7f0e-4d1b-8f11-88cdde7b6375', '2ddfd096-361c-484c-9155-31d8608c7543', '2ece7297-2300-4ccd-aadd-a1c766eb3cff', '3290fda0-885d-4489-8735-8981fc51ed41', '33df3b9d-80b9-41e6-a0d8-2ea06ea96912', '39b3101b-2643-4244-9b12-3f56c6a665cd', '3cf5d481-2739-4cb0-b22f-406494e20162', '463421b1-ab93-4617-94f4-70883dd217d4', '4a9d302c-ae69-41ca-a649-c3bb94980497', '518407e4-db44-4ea7-b31a-137cd779f7a1', '51de9db2-f7dd-4cfc-848f-cc825ced017b', '5566b765-9468-426f-8e79-81813f4e85f8', '56967c03-04fe-4f9f-b31a-4235746c6166', '56e64590-7ea7-40ac-bf72-b880c6f52477', '7d8cb0fb-ab4d-4d68-a468-ee88d2328850', '7ef92b8b-acb5-491e-9e3d-ebdfd36b6e3a', '89912857-2483-4859-81ba-e907db1e7c78', '8a5bcad0-9700-4094-bbf9-df4787c858c6', '8df3bf27-4bb5-46ed-93af-3d0d90f233ea', '93ec1323-2388-4f63-bd8e-db3fa2430e9d', '947802c8-0de3-4412-8408-40725af7423c', '97c5d392-79bb-46ac-823e-70b41de8c24e', '9a0efbfc-0c86-4ef6-ae2f-d1f93a10f48c', '9ea4fb42-94a6-4474-b827-c5d34de9f9cb', 'a0dc64d8-64c9-4a1f-9250-fac02bca0b33', 'a7dfd085-62b5-470c-8cc5-e0e33a18a4e2', 'a9a2546b-5261-473d-91f3-f7a53c1fafaa', 'a9f93ca0-84f6-4b7a-bc68-7bcf021e0fb1', 'aaf8c51f-720d-47e5-8a8e-ce2f8202183f', 'b1723c09-788b-4f45-ace3-bc9744128263', 'b4fba5c5-b537-4373-9cec-e876e8ef64e8', 'b9b5fd3f-bf03-4fb3-9de0-9d0bcb2d5246', 'c369184c-2477-497d-b4b4-982651174238', 'd0a1ab67-ac73-4f59-ab41-38f5605b4f41', 'd48601db-dc9a-45ab-a404-3e293bb153cf', 'd7d0c908-c77d-49a8-b86f-0b795a8f189e', 'dc1fa4da-261d-43a4-80d8-02befe02767b', 'dca69852-a57f-4061-86a2-c4b9797c8574', 'e435a177-7ee3-4820-b730-2e43dbc51fea', 'e5b602f4-bd6c-48d1-b15d-15b1538f2a54', 'ead3a2b6-ec2b-408c-b493-91ef71641d77', 'ed804c0f-dad5-4ce5-9da3-f69da43f137a', 'f03f4215-f8ff-4e1c-9708-9175004b0c52', 'f4529743-b68a-4dfb-92aa-cc6df6affc90', 'f52ec80f-4016-4b31-a703-981bd7ae95f8', 'f58ef2f6-e2bb-41aa-abaa-9d07dc091605', 'f6462a68-b3c3-43e8-9420-b0fccea730be', 'f7e2b138-b1c6-44ea-8ae6-7332fe8b0996', 'f9c08b89-e38d-4503-a36a-c3bfb95bf460', 'fbb683e0-50e7-4930-83c3-59e2c9b68a7c']",Proxy Re-Encryption: Analysis of constructions and its application to secure access delegation,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017

809,"We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for the simultaneous chemical process synthesis and heat integration with unclassified process streams. The model accounts for (1) streams that cannot be classified as hot or cold, and (2) variable stream temperatures and flow rates, thereby facilitating integration with a process synthesis model. The hot/cold stream “identities” are represented by classification binary variables which are (de)activated based on the relative stream inlet and outlet temperatures. Variables including stream temperatures and heat loads are disaggregated into hot and cold variables, and each variable is (de)activated by the corresponding classification binary variable. Stream inlet/outlet temperatures are positioned onto “dynamic” temperature intervals so that heat loads at each interval can be properly calculated. The proposed model is applied to two illustrative examples with variable stream flow rates and temperatures, and is integrated with a superstructure-based process synthesis model to illustrate its applicability.","['Lingxun Kong', 'Venkatachalam Avadiappan', 'Kefeng Huang', 'Christos T.

The code performances of three versions are examined on a test set of 144 systems. NCI calculations are particularly well suited to the GPU architecture, which reduces drastically the computational time. On a single compute node, the dual-GPU version leads to a 39-fold improvement for the biggest instance compared to the optimal OpenMP parallel run (C code, icc compiler) with 16 CPU cores. Energy consumption measurements carried out on both CPU and GPU NCI tests show that the GPU approach provides substantial energy savings. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['Gaëtan Rubez', 'Jean-Matthieu Etancelin', 'Xavier Vigouroux', 'Michaël Krajecki', 'Jean‐Charles Boisson', 'Eric Henon']",df02c7e7-ab76-4a57-bb7a-2911ae96514f,0,"['0eb7b0ff-1495-4be1-8098-08cdd2670ed8', '1f76878f-ef9b-4b64-b1af-a78350d798f7', '4b38e2d9-a51e-4619-9eb5-d45cf884e7a6', '5534f3e5-bbe7-4dfe-91b9-e80fb312b29c', '7c69b726-59fc-4ecf-9cad-72a5366ce1b6', '7e3e3277-8f3c-4df7-9579-bd59d42af3cd', '9ba65fdf-9337-4210-bba7-5e4bf9d9ddee']",GPU accelerated implementation of NCI calculations using promolecular density,Journal of Computational Chemistry,2017
811,"Since Balas extended the classical linear programming problem to the disjunctive programming (DP) problem where the constraints are combinations of both logic AND and OR, many researchers explored this optimization problem under various theoretical or application scenarios such as generalized disjunctive programming (GDP), optimization modulo theories (OMT), robot path planning, real-time systems, etc. However, the possibility of combining these differently-described but form-equivalent problems into a single expression remains overlooked. The contribution of this paper is two folded. First, we convert the linear DP/GDP model, linear-arithmetic OMT problem and related application problems into an equivalent form, referred to as the linear optimization over arithmetic constraint formula (LOACF). Second, a tree-search-based algorithm named RS-LPT is proposed to solve LOACF. RS-LPT exploits the techniques of interval analysis and nonparametric estimation for reducing the search tree and lowering the number of visited nodes. Also, RS-LPT alleviates bad construction of search tree by backtracking and pruning dynamically. We evaluate RS-LPT against two most common DP/GDP methods, three state-of-the-art OMT solvers and the disjunctive transformation based method on optimization benchmarks with different types and scales. Our results favor RS-LPT as compared to existing competing methods, especially for large scale cases.","['Li Chen', 'Yinrun Lyu', 'Chong Wang', 'Jingzheng Wu', 'Changyou Zhang', 'Nasro Min-Allah', 'Jamal Alhiyafi', 'Yongji Wang']",971f0821-e041-4c3b-a961-ec5c82a5af36,0,"['01c047b4-1c87-4df2-bf4d-4bb8400af94e', '0278bce3-e509-4ae6-b130-87a283a4b819', '03705092-8c47-4308-9f58-78180b689c3a', '22a1cec3-bb01-4771-b000-6a0f22bfbbed', '27801f58-8a36-42e5-83b1-fc630aca2a05', '37dd36ab-ec04-4b9f-a725-288f8fb37f93', '3d77aaef-52b9-4273-85c5-3c021f8570d2', '7154a5b0-c05c-46c9-b5e6-a825c686cddf', '7307b70f-1a98-4ef7-8f93-cfbcd1d270af', '77077790-0881-45d3-bde9-b12f64858987', '8b5f5a63-66c8-4b88-b2a0-2e6f9552aede', '8baf3447-6b5e-446f-bc0d-98f343595de4', '978ae75e-9e93-4040-9c74-227b302d492e', 'a1ab35c7-006c-43c8-bb98-1d801478eae5', 'a1c0a6bc-7f7e-4139-8248-c77fc3fd87c6', 'a6b375fc-f474-4fd9-8997-2966b4f0167e', 'ac3e03f6-5a83-4a06-8b21-109853b63e48', 'b9f3f0c8-ab40-466b-8335-358724be2026', 'be1e28e4-521a-4998-abfd-0938969ab769', 'cca7bbb5-c5b9-4e0c-af9e-da5bcbb00ead', 'cd211e12-af89-415b-8c20-3151649b743b', 'cdc70654-fb8f-44ab-add1-a498dc87bd2d', 'e6e40cc6-ede1-4057-bd6d-af394f54a0cc', 'f6adf585-9c74-4e7a-a862-9694978a2719', 'fa7a298d-ad29-42f4-bae9-18ba72a265ae', 'fb07a2ce-52f0-4d66-b0ef-91e888d3d652']",Solving linear optimization over arithmetic constraint formula,Journal of Global Optimization,2017
812,"Home Health Care (HHC) services are growing worldwide. HHC providers that employ their caregivers have to manage operational decisions such as assigning patients to caregivers and planning the caregivers’ routes. Centralized “off-line” approaches are generally used to deal with both these problems. In this paper, we solved the caregiver routing problem in a dynamic and distributed way using a Multi-agent system (MAS) to simulate caregiver behavior. Four decision rules were developed for the caregivers: NPR (Nearest Patient Rule), NRR (No-wait Route Rule), SRR (Shortest Route Rule), and BRR (Balanced Route Rule). These decision rules were implemented and tested on a multi-agent platform to assess their performances. We designed an experimental plan based on case studies that represent different sizes of HHC provider inspired from real-world examples.

813,"While Facebook is a popular venue for sharing information about ourselves, it also allows others to share information about us, which can lead to embarrassment. This study investigates the effects of shared face-threatening information on emotional and nonverbal indicators of embarrassment using an experiment (N = 120) in which pairs of friends posted about each other on Facebook. Results show that face-threatening information shared by others produces a powerful emotional and nonverbal embarrassment response. However, it is not the content of the face-threatening post that produces this effect. Rather, the level of embarrassment depends primarily on whether that information violates the individual's identity and if they perceive that unknown members of their audience can see it. In response, individuals were most likely to joke about the post, although those who were most embarrassed were more likely to delete it. These results inform our understanding of how the process of embarrassment works online. The emotional embarrassment response is similar to offline, but is affected by the features of these sites, such as a large, invisible audience, and the need for ideal self-presentation. This finding has important implications for treating online social networks and their effects to be as “real” as those offline.","['Anne Oeldorf-Hirsch', 'Jeremy P. Birnholtz', 'Jeffrey T.

814,"While the production process evolves toward modularization and decentralization, the design of supply chain networks, in particular considering the agile manufacturing scenario, becomes challenging due to the following reasons: (1) supply chains that produce a network of components become large-scale; (2) the number of possible assignments is growing exponentially as the increasing choices of plants for components. In this paper, the assignment problem considers the strategic and tactical decisions together, which involves the mapping of components to geographically distributed plants, the selection of logistics services between the mapped plants, and the allocation of inventories in each plant. The goal of this paper is to find the optimal assignment with the minimum total cost under the constraint of production rate. We first mathematically formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program. Then, by deriving the properties of pipelined production in supply chain networks, we develop dynamic programming algorithms to efficiently obtain the optimal assignments. By the consideration of high degree of pipelining, our techniques can make a good tradeoff between high production rate and low operation cost. Extensive computational experiments show that the proposed algorithms can find high quality solutions, which achieve significant improvement compared with the initiative approaches.","['Weiwen Jiang', 'Edwin Hsing-Mean Sha', 'Qingfeng Zhuge', 'Lin Wu']",18a9aa82-4715-4b5e-9e4e-4930ba674d54,0,"['02edb868-fab0-45bc-9c66-8a7f030f0d76', '0ec07c0d-566d-4a02-958a-2e400896cbcc', '268a5429-dca8-47f9-bf23-76533ef74e39', '3a9b6540-b390-4fb5-b959-c9aa21556c51', '48ad1f47-bbd8-413d-8b37-10cb791360a0', '4e38957c-12e3-4d0d-bf2d-3faf7d574e78', '627b7a22-3a4b-4280-88a6-5942ec9bc730', '66df833a-2e42-4303-9617-f29a18fbd24a', '7f9e8d7c-a6a7-484b-9b64-f3f620511762', '958a57b4-3dd2-41e3-9fa1-dde9714a83fc', '9c2d6bf5-981a-43a0-be2b-e36614c7fa35', 'a04e6553-5491-46c4-9f1b-d46b1cedf94a', 'a69a01b1-64fd-42cb-aa2c-30eaae724cf1', 'c5677239-c66a-4536-b4c9-3a6d12212617', 'ceda0f13-e1b5-4638-a2a4-b279c90fa5fe', 'f5ba064e-6242-423d-aeaa-aec79b30a4c0']",Efficient assignment algorithms to minimize operation cost for supply chain networks in agile manufacturing,Computers & Industrial Engineering,2017
815,"Search in social network is continuously being expanded to enhance user experience. Besides basic textual retrieval, users can also search based on features such as spatial proximity, temporal freshness and/or social closeness. To efficiently process each advanced query type, customized indexing mechanisms have been developed. However, such mechanisms only perform well for the query types that they were designed for; moreover, they are not readily adaptable to support other query types. In this paper, we propose an interval-at-a-time (IAAT) framework as a first attempt to provide a one-size-fits-all solution to social media retrieval with spatial, temporal and social constraints. In addition, the algorithm relies on inverted index only, which makes it compatible with conventional search engines. The inverted lists are sorted by document id and the insertion is very fast because only append operation is involved. Experiments conducted on two large-scale Twitter datasets show that though IAAT is a unified strategy, it performs better than most of the state-of-the-art customized solutions in a variety of query types.","['Lianli Gao', 'Yuan Wang', 'Dongsheng Li', 'Junming Shao', 'Jingkuan Song']",f5bbf8b1-c5b9-48cf-9706-772a127d5f83,50,"['1375d034-cffe-4de0-a082-a9ec42f76b64', '20ad42ad-a4bc-4a8e-b3ff-ce7c4374ba13', '29b02443-3a45-4a70-8290-8383dd2ef6a0', '2eefabbb-4a4c-427b-84c6-1981e7c45a2e', '2fdbff7f-f7ab-4fd0-8211-898b47841a28', '360698d5-b591-4c76-9d36-ab936e43999d', '41d1521d-a001-485e-855e-b50cfe759902', '48fea190-e6e6-4ba4-94cd-e1541bb15ed9', '4a382a95-e658-42ef-a355-6c8d26d12a50', '4b59ea65-e276-4a13-a8bd-423dd05a00a5', '56a41f3c-7b53-43c4-a7f9-dfdcdb51de7c', '6a3af9fb-a69f-4d86-99df-1e1f0a8ac686', '726aed81-2f93-426e-ac26-8a48fad66141', '76b1e4ef-3815-4d73-ae0f-f4d4e95deeaa', '81bac09b-624f-4ce1-9716-f84c66848a1a', '8412d78a-85be-4492-a9ef-a5e4c485ae3a', '8c396587-01ee-4084-9348-fc729b7fefb2', '8fc0f295-5cec-4698-8da1-2a592663f9d5', '94617485-8810-4f47-86ca-c8b19a0806ba', '95ee256d-e10e-4725-8382-59a3fca63784', '9a8bdeef-b1aa-4b1e-acc7-6c532f2ba074', 'ab1a6dea-8023-4b6b-983c-eb148226bcc5', 'b24a5a47-2ac3-4a79-8977-45fc1deaef8f', 'b7750b50-5979-456d-8ae5-75105d64e841', 'bdb70549-bd47-41d9-ac27-92dd9947e8de', 'bfce3dd7-cebc-4693-9cfb-1e6b17d9f1f9', 'c2fa1f01-5872-40a5-bb71-12925c7898e6', 'c4f758d8-61a2-469b-b381-48939d62ce6c', 'c5a3995f-2b32-44cb-8e22-cfd4d536208d', 'c61f011f-898e-4eb2-917d-a4b54d7cbf79', 'c7f40ba2-aa31-4507-a1c0-648c57ed9c7b', 'c8b0d732-d538-476d-8a08-4c3184051917', 'cce7f9ae-5c4e-4688-a13e-fcc9cf338221', 'd08394bc-6e68-40f8-970c-7bc5f8ae510f', 'd4d05e9a-b0d0-4210-8e16-94c8cb36164e', 'd4ec496a-f2a1-4335-8d6c-df03cf2019ec', 'd5610a80-09e9-4f6d-b136-44a24d7b92f8', 'd573a177-f4db-49d7-9327-c50bd38cbd16', 'db1633ea-169c-49ff-8ee9-64abc3f20086', 'e3e4a1e7-c811-4f80-bd11-18a29eeb6c87', 'ef398d01-f508-4e99-a189-b52e4e83b139', 'f7694e91-7bcf-49e7-ae50-e537b6405a82', 'fc46826b-3cd6-4962-ad91-7414541e7278', 'fd908978-431e-4a4a-b6b1-248f769fe5cc']","Real-time social media retrieval with spatial, temporal and social constraints",Neurocomputing,2017
816,"The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) method is a high order numerical method that can handle discontinuous problems efficiently. The hybrid WENO method adopts the WENO reconstruction in the region where the jump discontinuity exists, while other high order reconstruction is adopted in the smooth region. Thus for the hybrid WENO method, the jump location should be identified before the adoption. Various edge detection methods have been developed mostly focusing on finding edges as accurately as possible utilizing as many stencils as possible. However, if the reconstruction in the smooth area is obtained with the fixed finite number of cells, it would suffice to examine whether the considered stencils need to adopt the WENO reconstruction instead of finding edges in a global manner. In this note, we compare the multi-resolution analysis with the local monotone polynomial method for the   5     5       th order hybrid WENO method. The monotone method uses the cell information within the given stencil only to decide whether to adopt the WENO reconstruction or not. In this sense, the local method is optimal. We provide a detailed numerical study and show that the monotone polynomial method is efficient and accurate.","['Jingyang Guo', 'Jae-Hun Jung']",50342863-dfa9-4f35-b812-21b485a27cbd,0,"['26344680-78b3-4eaa-b704-27ca0c016170', '6224300c-7be6-4df3-b00f-a0dee232270a', '98466daf-07a5-418f-9129-0ebe1df1e31f', 'c04676ed-df0b-4b0e-832b-184335fda3cb', 'e850c75b-a2a7-49f0-a177-c8a75cca7eaf', 'f1aac9a0-a6e9-4d3d-9ff1-9045d3aec7ad']",A numerical study of the local monotone polynomial edge detection for the hybrid WENO method,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,2017

The results show that self-disclosure on Facebook moderates the relationship between stressful life events and mental health.

819,"A new method using genetic algorithm and support vector regression with parameter optimization (GA–SVR–PO) was developed for the prediction of compound retention indices (RI) in gas chromatography. The dataset used in this work consists of 252 compounds extracted from the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) boiling point database. Molecular descriptors were calculated by descriptor tools of the MOE software package. After removing redundant descriptors, 151 descriptors were obtained for each compound. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to select the best subset of molecular descriptors and the best parameters of SVR to optimize the prediction performance of compound retention indices. A 10-fold cross-validation method was used to evaluate the prediction performance. We compared the performance of our proposed model with three existing methods: GA coupled with multiple linear regression (GA–MLR), the subset selected by GA–MLR used to train SVR (GA–MLR–SVR), and GA on SVR (GA–SVR). The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed GA–SVR–PO model has better predictive performance than other existing models with  R 2   > 0.967 and RMSE = 49.94.

However, due to recent advancements in communication technology, various services now make this kind of information accessible to customers at a reasonable cost.

Inspection is associated with a cost. We compute the equilibrium in this model and prove its existence and uniqueness. Based on two normalized parameters—congestion and service valuation—we map all possible input parameter sets into three scenarios.

Then, these features are predicted by support vector machine (SVM) and the predictive capability of proposed method is implemented by jackknife test  Results  The results show that the golden section method is better than no segmentation method. The overall accuracy for ZD98 and CL317 is 98.98% and 91.11%, respectively, which indicates that our method can play a complimentary role to the existing methods in the relevant areas.  Conclusions  The proposed feature representation is powerful and the prediction accuracy will be improved greatly, which denotes our method provides the state-of-the-art performance for predicting subcellular location of apoptosis proteins.","['Qilin Xiang', 'Bo Liao', 'Xianhong Li', 'Huimin Xu', 'Jing Chen', 'Zhuoxing Shi', 'Qi Dai', 'Yuhua Yao']",51d54a84-41fd-4ba8-8eeb-d07e25332e90,0,"['148c2401-e0a9-413d-9b1d-4b2ac185fd21', '17d522c4-b47c-43c6-bbf1-1fe1b28185c2', '7a7c55ed-0163-407f-94ca-bf33d6a8510a', '7e3fe636-e625-44d9-a315-eb9717f17e3b', '9abf980d-ace1-4858-b62b-573d26defc18', 'ad81de74-d64c-4b0d-883a-90de313b19d2', 'faa9acbb-e633-4c72-a239-1c988afcf9f7']",Subcellular localization prediction of apoptosis proteins based on evolutionary information and support vector machine,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,2017
823,"Virtual Data Centre (VDC) allocation requires the provisioning of both computing and network resources. Their joint provisioning allows for an optimal utilization of the physical Data Centre (DC) infrastructure resources. However, traditional DCs can suffer from computing resource underutilization due to the rigid capacity configurations of the server units, resulting in high computing resource fragmentation across the DC servers. To overcome these limitations, the disaggregated DC paradigm has been recently introduced. Thanks to resource disaggregation, it is possible to allocate the exact amount of resources needed to provision a VDC instance. In this paper, we focus on the static planning of a shared optically interconnected disaggregated DC infrastructure to support a known set of VDC instances to be deployed on top. To this end, we provide optimal and sub-optimal techniques to determine the necessary capacity (both in terms of computing and network resources) required to support the expected set of VDC demands. Next, we quantitatively evaluate the benefits yielded by the disaggregated DC paradigm in front of traditional DC architectures, considering various VDC profiles and Data Centre Network (DCN) topologies.","['Albert Pages', 'Rubén Serrano', 'Jordi Perello', 'Salvatore Spadaro']",8b0ece75-76c4-42db-9364-ec63e561f404,0,"['1858870c-2d40-4cf4-be49-2110ab4278e6', '4a7d031e-6ee4-47ef-833e-c3e796bde09a', '4c433606-8817-4f2c-873f-8c8639546f20', '5040d935-a755-49f9-b058-2223af2db9a9', '62a6b7a5-45d7-41bc-8a8c-7dba0ebb8c9b', '6832d318-a522-4f6e-b816-a65d42910e52', '86b5221f-719d-482a-b6c5-a8e0b68527a4', 'ac1f24ad-68c6-4c31-94cf-654a3c7365e3', 'b332c8a1-81c8-41bb-959e-36aa876e82d0', 'e2af64eb-1b19-41dc-9124-560bcc6dbc65', 'e69e7a2e-2365-4e78-ba5d-d01fd70ed8f8', 'f7c165b8-3991-4255-a639-fb2407666a5c']",On the benefits of resource disaggregation for virtual data centre provisioning in optical data centres,Computer Communications,2017
824,"Pointwise asymptotic stability, or semistability, is a property of the set of equilibria of a dynamical system, where every equilibrium is Lyapunov stable and every solution is convergent to some equilibrium. Under an appropriate version of asymptotic controllability assumption, it is shown that the property can be achieved in a hybrid control system by open-loop optimal solutions of an infinite-horizon optimal control problem. For discrete-time systems, the optimal solutions can be generated by feedback.

825,"In the future heterogeneous wireless networks, heterogeneity of radio resources from different radio access technologies (RATs) still exists. The heterogeneity, especially for networks with the coexistence of non-orthogonal and orthogonal resources, makes the radio resources difficult to be uniformly measured, and thus hinders the efficient utilization of radio resources. To overcome this limitation, this letter firstly proposes a radio resource virtualization approach in heterogeneous networks. Based on the accumulated historical data of resource utilization information, heterogeneous radio resources are virtualized into normalized resources using deep learning method. Secondly, the consumption difference of virtualized resources under different situations of network load and user demand is modeled. Moreover, aiming at efficiently utilizing radio resources and reducing access blocking rate, a RAT selection scheme based on the radio resource virtualization is proposed. Through simulation, the validity of the proposed scheme is evaluated.","['Shaoshuai Fan', 'Hui Tian', 'Weidong Wang']",23df92ab-6e55-4734-88be-ba224da5cc80,0,"['243ec5ea-b80b-4451-af3d-666cfdf669e3', '429b6764-5006-4f64-93be-715d972f14f9', '6e3bd563-3574-4f70-9ab3-ec30e8b1b7e9', '917b4979-32e0-471e-84e2-3012f696b78a', 'c6fd26e6-331d-44c7-b672-15a90aebd84b', 'e2dd0daa-f33a-4c62-bd6f-939f8ae9f51d']",A Radio Resource Virtualization-Based RAT Selection Scheme in Heterogeneous Networks,IEEE Communications Letters,2017
826,"Today, software is traded worldwide on global markets, with apps being downloaded to smartphones within minutes or seconds. This poses, more than ever, the challenge of ensuring safety of software in the face of (1) unknown or untrusted software providers together with (2) resource-limited software consumers. The concept of Proof-Carrying Code (PCC), years ago suggested by Necula, provides one framework for securing the execution of untrusted code. PCC techniques attach safety proofs, constructed by software producers, to code. Based on the assumption that  checking  proofs is usually much simpler than  constructing  proofs, software consumers should thus be able to quickly check the safety of software. However, PCC techniques often suffer from the size of  certificates  (i.e., the attached proofs), making PCC techniques inefficient in practice.   In this article, we introduce a new framework for the safe execution of untrusted code called  Programs from Proofs  (PfP). The basic assumption underlying the PfP technique is the fact that the  structure  of programs significantly influences the complexity of checking a specific safety property. Instead of attaching proofs to program code, the PfP technique transforms the program into an efficiently checkable form, thus guaranteeing quick safety checks for software consumers. For this transformation, the technique also uses a producer-side automatic proof of safety. More specifically, safety proving for the software producer proceeds via the construction of an abstract reachability graph (ARG) unfolding the control-flow automaton (CFA) up to the degree necessary for simple checking. To this end, we combine different sorts of software analysis: expensive analyses incrementally determining the degree of unfolding, and cheap analyses responsible for safety checking. Out of the abstract reachability graph we generate the new program. In its CFA structure, it is isomorphic to the graph and hence another, this time consumer-side, cheap analysis can quickly determine its safety.   Like PCC, Programs from Proofs is a general framework instantiable with different sorts of (expensive and cheap) analysis. Here, we present the general framework and exemplify it by some concrete examples. We have implemented different instantiations on top of the configurable program analysis tool CPA checker  and report on experiments, in particular on comparisons with PCC techniques.","['Marie-Christine Jakobs', 'Heike Wehrheim']",e006ddcf-939c-4d56-8866-a0893d92eadf,0,"['0e8f8c67-48fa-45bd-8297-8d189a51115a', '18aab269-c80e-4cac-9730-87b864d4279c', '198e0bba-d97a-4a85-a9a6-2d8ae4c7bb06', '1b1de7a0-5add-49c9-b4da-2589aba4093c', '1cdebd44-0e8d-46db-b01b-9acbaa75b6b7', '2376c562-2d9e-4768-931b-7e467d885d14', '2453a187-b834-4b85-9166-dfa680bb67e8', '2a59ffdc-318a-4780-94e2-071a5d731256', '2ac076c9-309c-4fc4-ba8d-da3cff20d149', '2ae6805d-9219-4c8a-b7e2-aa7a4709b5b1', '2b0565e2-65aa-4fa8-ad74-5dca48bad39f', '2b82dcc0-2982-424b-9824-0f6a769f0065', '2c850a6b-215d-4eaf-9dc2-d2e8e7e06766', '2e12991c-3b41-4e37-88ff-74ed641267a9', '2e242c02-8776-4102-9a5a-67fcdbe2d1e5', '3926768b-4c44-4db4-b2fd-48fc00814f59', '41271c65-2b98-4fba-9679-1b17a64e6b07', '47a26f01-2498-4650-bfef-8cab9a6ddeff', '47d409a6-4a92-4df4-af6c-037ed8e7a655', '48189e49-62dd-4874-9cb5-272caa77da92', '4c6626bd-1f21-456c-ac27-9ba2c2bc1a6a', '4f8ea1c7-af58-4ea4-8aeb-eadb0160d891', '55414f1e-9d31-4554-a694-911696defcc9', '5eec33b4-69c0-4997-a966-f3b580808f2d', '5f51f095-db6f-4ef7-bb7e-9aaeeb59b3b9', '60b2db11-7dba-495d-bf65-038681c766f7', '658d0366-c18f-4ea6-82fd-47a0da98f444', '698bfd57-36bb-4d0e-98a1-faed935ccafc', '70fbbb54-06d6-41ce-9282-e30eb71a4a44', '718d1def-c7e5-4d80-acc7-0a15a72d51b2', '7da6efa0-e662-4c30-bb2c-59716399c24a', '7fbd8ef9-b9cb-4bf6-b1e4-e4f936ee15f2', '8d1534ff-4e47-40ae-81ab-79944930c742', '8e4d260b-6587-4b4f-a19e-ceb284a703b3', '9228034a-a883-4f69-85a1-e5c16540f2fa', '927957ad-f51f-4521-bb7c-6f31ce880b91', '9642e785-c807-4ef5-ab34-109d88997e3c', '97af4c9c-f696-4f5f-a295-3ebe61ca49db', '9a4984f9-27d4-47eb-8bc8-0469bf540f94', '9ab89146-d7fb-47db-975c-c230cc988b46', '9d1196b4-69ad-4e45-915b-c3921904a548', 'a723e654-05bd-4d67-b275-a7a35c5e16b0', 'a7f3b208-0360-4587-a2e7-d6fd6623015f', 'a8abed4a-647f-40fe-8206-9664ecd019d1', 'adc3ece1-718a-4667-897e-dc5ea1e89d1e', 'b0dfb861-ce55-4697-a24f-c69dec741014', 'b3cd1359-87fe-4128-b3d1-8e510232b29e', 'b4b38911-94db-4e34-9567-bd36ee1a13d3', 'ba78b7e3-85cb-4afa-ae9e-76f390f99d07', 'bcc3ef1c-e19e-4c62-959a-10ea2ce0d6c0', 'bf17aa55-89f5-4719-8b85-3437634b67fc', 'c17292e0-69fe-4abf-b2ad-36ac05c6aba5', 'c2ad5a92-cf98-419b-bbda-b42d225323f1', 'c56344a6-7332-4d69-8bd4-910f8c458d07', 'c7ba92ff-3cb7-4d42-b1ae-5bd6fee9b1ba', 'c7c8f1e2-97a1-4f6b-88df-aa77866a80a0', 'd09f90bd-a7c4-4c86-9ec8-b19a11795ac4', 'd196ebe5-517e-4423-a021-ec7206cad311', 'd6136273-c038-42b8-b456-3856d2742ff2', 'd620f4ae-af50-47ff-9870-85a6f447b8ea', 'd6289f8d-fbf9-45f3-a71a-bd2ecac4c0a9', 'd7a70d65-a2ee-4361-a47c-9ae6ef61eb61', 'db1fb080-1898-4bb4-917e-c31f1be1a470', 'ddad15a7-774e-486c-9b01-7afed87710ab', 'de2abf70-86e1-4df1-b04a-b4a97c77a48d', 'f201cc4a-acf6-4690-9b11-b3e94419fd20', 'f424ebb7-c926-4d99-95b4-4108cacd2c60', 'f6820b0c-0c79-41b9-b465-a032f14368ab', 'fa8e3a6f-1cde-418b-aec3-24d2acc65df4']",Programs from Proofs: A Framework for the Safe Execution of Untrusted Software,ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems,2017
827,"Viscous fluid flow simulations based on dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) may bear compressible flow effects when flowing through severe stenotic geometries. This is caused by the soft repulsive potential employed in the DPD force field, which limits the particle-based fluid system ability to sustain a large degree of compression. To mitigate this problem, a Morse potential was added to the DPD force field. We studied the fluid properties of the modified fluid model (DPD–Morse) and compared it with a previously published conventional DPD based fluid model. Our DPD–Morse model demonstrated reduced compressibility while preserving other fluid properties such as the fluid density and viscosity. We further investigated the fluid flow properties for a severe 3D stenotic microchannel with a 67% stenosis, using the two models. The DPD fluid model presented a significant density gradient along the flow direction, where the fluid density increased upstream towards the stenosis and decreased downstream from the stenosis before regaining its initial value. In contrast, the DPD–Morse model demonstrated a far better uniform fluid density distribution along the flow direction. We compared both solutions with CFD simulations. The DPD–Morse fluid resembled the behavior of the continuum fluid model whereas DPD fluid deviated from it. To estimate the effect that the difference between the two DPD formulations may have on the platelet activation potential, we have further embedded a platelet model within the flow field and investigated the shear stress accumulation along the platelet transport trajectory. In the stenotic section, the DPD fluid demonstrated a larger stress gradient than the DPD–Morse fluid. The platelet transport period was shorter for the DPD fluid as it generated a larger fluid density gradient that overestimated the acceleration of the platelet through the stenosis. With reduced fluid compressibility, our modified DPD–Morse fluid model was more accurate than the DPD fluid model when computing the platelet activation potential in a severe stenosis.","['Chao Gao', 'Peng Zhang', 'Gil Marom', 'Yuefan Deng', 'Danny Bluestein']",6b334b31-718a-4601-8f26-fca4f85640fb,0,"['015f5a28-c60a-4004-b81e-96d90b3e983a', '3911de5c-de67-4138-80ec-dadbcde947f4', '4deb75ef-5f7c-4b4b-9935-e0a6eafa06b7', '53c69936-3142-4f4f-b22b-39d916409a95', '9f6fa3a8-b584-465c-a505-0468c483f133', 'ac1ce94e-7254-42a2-b79e-0f0584d3bc13', 'acc35b97-e507-4fbe-967f-9a0729bd4469', 'c27088fc-0e95-4019-9adb-c00cf3a34ef9', 'eb841a50-8856-4fc9-ac4a-764238dcea29', 'ecd72385-dccb-4d8b-aa62-58b21a1ace85', 'ed340ac3-9186-4b85-bcd6-fba04c11cf33']",Reducing the effects of compressibility in DPD-based blood flow simulations through severe stenotic microchannels,Journal of Computational Physics,2017

In this paper, we propose a simulation-based machine shop operations scheduling system for minimizing the energy cost without sacrificing the productivity.

First, the real-time energy consumption monitoring function is developed to collect energy consumption data and provide real-time energy consumption status monitoring/electrical load abnormality warnings. Second, the simulation-based machine shop operations scheduling function is devised to estimate the energy consumptions and cost of CNC machines. In addition, an additive regression algorithm is developed to formulate energy consumption models for each individual machine as simulation inputs.

831,"A blind image quality assessment technique with no-training is proposed in this paper. The proposed technique considers two important types of distortions viz. noise and blur for quality estimation of an image. The technique is motivated by two significant phenomena of perception in the retina of an eye. First being the center-surround retinal receptive field and second, existence of multiple spatial frequency channels. Center-surround retinal receptive field in the proposed technique is modeled with the help of Difference of Gaussians (DoG). In retina, multiple spatial frequencies have been found and due to this, signals generated from center and surround fields exist at different frequencies. In order to mimic center-surround receptive field at multiple frequencies, we compute multiple DoG images at multiple standard deviation values generated for different frequencies. Further, two significant features based on entropy and edges are extracted from the obtained DoG images and are subsequently used to compute the quality of the image. The proposed technique does not require any training with distorted or pristine images; or subjective human score to predict quality of the image. We evaluate the proposed technique on LIVE, CSIQ and TID08 databases and observe that the obtained results match very well with human subjective opinions.

832,"In order to improve the production technology of the lead-free BGA (Ball Grid Array) assembly, a numerical method is developed to predict the yield of the soldering process based on calculated stand-off stiffness curves and component warpage. The stand-off stiffness curve which reflects the relationship of the force and height of solder joints is obtained by solving the differential equations of the solder joint shapes of BGA solder joints using the Runge-Kutta method. The analytical expression of thermal warpage of component in free boundary constraint conditions is proposed based on the lamination theory of the elastic mechanics. The expression can reflect the material parameter variation with temperature and provide an effective calculation method to analyze component warpage with large changing temperature during soldering reflow process. Considering the manufacture deviation of volumes and the randomness of the positions of the solder joints, combined with the stand-off stiffness curves and the component warping deformation, the yield of the soldering process can be predicted. According to the types and positions of the failure solder joints, the production technology can be improved. Based on the stand-off curves of solder joints, the influence of the deviation rate of volume of the solder joint and diameter of pad on the yield of self-assembly are simulated. The optimal matching relations of the solder joint volume and the diameter of the pad with the 0.35 mm pitch and 0.3 mm pitch are analyzed.","['Yilong Chen', 'Jianyuan Jia', 'Hongzhi Fu', 'Zhaofei Zhu']",6686052f-cdb3-4bcd-9b3e-e54f8dab26b5,0,"['02eb604e-fc3f-48ba-b71a-b8a0bd22d821', '14534f9e-79b2-48fd-ae5c-5b2c02f48c9b', '4fa069fe-6024-4c53-be21-bd5530a04ed2']",Development of numerical algorithm to guide solder joint structure and component structural design during manufacturing,Microelectronics Reliability,2017
833,"A novel sink repositioning scheme to prolong lifetime in wireless sensor network presents in this paper. The proposed method called Queen honey bee migration (QHBM) algorithm mimics the migration process of queen honey bee in nature. In short, the queen begins her journey to find the new location for hive which assisted by scout bees. Queen may visit several places until she found the place to settle down. Henceforth, sink represents Queen and CH nodes are assigned as scout bees. In QHBM, sink relocates itself from the initial position towards the selected pole of cardinal direction, for example: sink moves towards North pole. The sink movement is guided by CH nodes which have highest remaining energy. After arrived in the new position, sink recalculates parameters for next journey. Sink collects data whenever it arrived in the future position. CH nodes are rotated in each journey of a sink. Therefore, the proposed method can balance the energy consumption among nodes and prolong network lifetime. We conducted simulation and compared the proposed QHBM algorithm with static sink and existing sink repositioning schemes, namely random, rendezvous, and EASR. We clearly found that the network lifetime with all sink repositioning schemes is longer than static sink. The obtained results show that the network lifetime extension by QHBM sink repositioning is 1.2 times of lifetime with static sink. QHBM surpassed random, rendezvous and EASR in lifetime extension for about 1.16, 1.1, and 1.06 times, respectively.","['Gwo-Jia Jong', 'Aripriharta', 'Hendrick', 'Gwo-Jiun Horng']",694bc4e6-0f3c-4579-bd90-2a96fb16c768,0,"['0709ccae-4449-498f-9b1f-94efd095e14b', '09c4b675-7a8a-4941-967c-6bada75ba3f3', '13234733-5ecf-4c10-abc1-db125c0f18f3', '15fe6f17-1ba4-4cde-bccd-bf0daa60b393', '18b41332-5edb-4adf-ad0e-956a66925afc', '1d59d96c-19e5-4e48-8ea9-e06920353e99', '28e4589b-48fb-4716-820b-78d87f3736d7', '322ea0a1-b4e3-412c-955b-f2b6f67f13e1', '4037ca2e-4b42-4f79-9ced-848f211011eb', '41c15320-c0f0-43cc-b38c-df04a2befdbe', '4727de9d-70b4-4020-b7d2-08fcf0db5e69', '4f67e6ff-4641-4c16-9987-4bef8813b578', '51cbc57a-705a-4935-ba73-d2aca02bd50b', '59327200-f5e4-465f-85e4-ecd1df483f10', '59f40299-f295-4c6b-88ad-81a8b48ad75a', '60bd8233-9af3-48e1-8ddc-cb3208c002b6', '6d054dbc-7212-4f5e-afeb-1ec1fd6546fd', '74e08f04-c41b-4297-80b4-57b07eac2103', '83ab616a-1a5f-43c2-983a-41b73127cbb1', '9f014de8-e0db-4432-bfae-6d3a6c748623', 'a6a4b469-a0c0-49aa-a24f-9e68e5da98db', 'b5112938-8a59-422a-a497-0adb27628ea0', 'beadd498-564a-4657-8f80-e9ade433129e', 'cc12d531-a3e1-4e16-a6da-7ff40243cd83', 'ce11679a-13fa-4e46-bd38-576ccd3efc97', 'd9188df4-6917-4086-b0ec-da97dbc0199b', 'e228fa60-df6e-4ce1-9948-1c44e98ae854', 'e670d31b-75de-4836-98ee-7d12fff78955', 'e78e11a1-cb3f-4172-92a0-57e688e8a96a']",A Novel Queen Honey Bee Migration (QHBM) Algorithm for Sink Repositioning in Wireless Sensor Network,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

Although these works have yielded promising performance, we hypothesize that these performances can be improved by a better understanding of malicious behavior.#R##N##R##N#Objective: To characterize malicious apps, we take into account both information on app descriptions, which are indicative of apps’ topics, and information on sensitive data flow, which can be relevant to discriminate malware from benign apps.#R##N##R##N#Method: In this paper, we propose a topic-specific approach to malware comprehension based on app descriptions and data-flow information. First, we use an advanced topic model, adaptive LDA with GA, to cluster apps according to their descriptions. Then, we use information gain ratio of sensitive data flow information to build so-called “topic-specific data flow signatures”.#R##N##R##N#Results: We conduct an empirical study on 3691 benign and 1612 malicious apps. We group them into 118 topics and generate topic-specific data flow signature. We verify the effectiveness of the topic-specific data flow signatures by comparing them with the overall data flow signature. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis on 25 representative topic-specific signatures and yield several implications.#R##N##R##N#Conclusion: Topic-specific data flow signatures are efficient in highlighting the malicious behavior, and thus can help in characterizing malware.","['Xinli Yang', 'David Lo', 'Li Li', 'Xin Xia', 'Tegawendé François D Assise Bissyande', 'Jacques Klein']",5e978069-a8ef-43ae-aa22-189fa218cdd7,0,"['1ab19309-b71b-4b97-aec9-0fa77dd98d44', '1db8ee3b-5f90-4fed-bb95-9dcf42c59f56', '1f353f84-68b0-4f38-9e7f-5f83da1390e7', '2228b482-2157-43aa-8712-f9ab4c434824', '2562cca1-d5cd-4429-a73f-4fa7d555eba0', '2d695384-927d-4975-97fb-21b0212a1ec8', '323cf346-5269-4834-99b6-783f7e639d4d', '47c2c88f-17b8-4fda-83ba-f54382a7a3c4', '4dad95e5-2896-4fa4-b133-570e0ba3d23e', '52275c49-b945-4ce7-a4f2-67d9f912050b', '5a605908-ae64-4803-a04a-65923cf66250', '60f32cb8-b61a-464b-a20a-b98f14e20aab', '621cbb55-0b62-42b3-9fae-1bec1c3be7aa', '652772bc-c6a2-41bb-8d5b-eba0cbd66dec', '67fc952f-bfd9-4f16-bd93-8642066897c5', '6aec772b-ed45-4adc-b53f-c3dba2be760e', '754934b6-bee0-411e-ad22-d511defaf9f9', '7b062126-f6e2-40c8-a8d8-18ee2a2de941', '8139bbb9-4119-4df2-86ed-8551a9098466', '91f1a382-e45f-413f-98ab-016f565885d9', '951a3c0b-0588-45db-9ea9-f7d038f5eaa3', '9843871e-f71d-4006-af62-5604d25a5040', 'a0449e51-ef5b-48a5-bea7-df87bd6f1778', 'b55e03a8-f43f-48d7-96a4-8c29ecfe3372', 'b61f4575-3a06-4565-aff7-04b69be787e3', 'b9604331-efd9-40a1-ac07-df82982e406b', 'cbf15e30-75e4-438b-bd6b-fc7bc327597a', 'cf6c7df7-d161-49b5-97b3-346b391c0422', 'd1657f6b-d92e-4a18-b571-c4b1f8584ec5', 'e04536af-c0e5-44ee-aa6c-bac1dd6f1c0a', 'e500e9d3-6a1a-4dec-bbcf-82a5906d1532', 'e61bb68b-8b04-4bf3-a09a-a31a8b6386bb', 'ed736576-1c48-4474-b716-fad258521f69', 'f08b534c-b980-4ab7-87ad-576b629053fb', 'f3cf8116-63a6-4925-a1ff-cb5013f7dfe4', 'f58cca08-6f29-4124-9736-3e3580cb025f', 'fae0519e-7db2-4686-bd50-cb820507e25d']",Characterizing malicious Android apps by mining topic-specific data flow signatures,Information & Software Technology,2017

836,"The role of stakeholders in organizational decision-making is gaining more and more attention. Managers find that in order to create value sustainably and ethically, it is necessary to balance the interests of various stakeholders. This trend is reflected in the management literature, where much advancement has been made in what is known as stakeholder theory. In the founding years of stakeholder theory there was a close connection and interchange of ideas between stakeholder theorists and operational researchers. Yet in recent years, the stream of papers that includes both fields has dwindled to a trickle. This lack of theoretical integration is surprising, as Operational Research is in nature a collaborative discipline. In this paper, we discuss three topics in stakeholder theory that can inform and improve studies involving working with stakeholders in Operational Research: instrumental versus moral stakeholder theory; focusing on trade-offs versus focusing on avoiding trade-offs; and focusing on the decision-making organization versus focusing on stakeholder engagement. We then conduct a systematic review of 144 Operational Research articles on the topic ‘stakeholders’. Content analysis of these articles reveals four distinct traditions of working with stakeholders: optimizing, balancing, structuring and involving. We compare the four traditions on goals, role of the analyst, type of data used, and results. Our analysis provides the basis for recommendations to Operational Research practitioners on how to work with stakeholders.","['Vincent de Gooyert', 'E.A.J.A.

837,"In this paper, a complete system for image transmission in harsh underwater environment is proposed. The key to increase the performance of the system is the use of an efficient image compression algorithm with a bandwidth-efficient modulation technique. The wavelet packet (WP) decomposition is used to get the best image representation and the set partitioning in hierarchical trees is applied on the WP coefficients. The parental conflicts are resolved, the parent–child relationships are adapted and thus the similarities between cross-subbands are preserved. Reed–Solomon is used for forward error correction to combat with the errors in wireless transmission. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with differential quadrature phase shift keying is used to transmit the generated bit stream. Effective image quality metrics are used for objective evaluation. Results show that the proposed system manages to transmit images over the limited bandwidth, and to effectively minimize the perceptual degradation.","['Hanaa S. Ali', 'Asmaa M. Atallah', 'Mahmoud I.

838,"For many real systems, several computer models may exist with different physics and predictive abilities. To achieve more accurate simulations/predictions, it is desirable for these models to be properly combined and calibrated. We propose the Bayesian calibration of computer model mixture method which relies on the idea of representing the real system output as a mixture of the available computer model outputs with unknown input dependent weight functions. The method builds a fully Bayesian predictive model as an emulator for the real system output by combining, weighting, and calibrating the available models in the Bayesian framework. Moreover, it fits a mixture of calibrated computer models that can be used by the domain scientist as a mean to combine the available computer models, in a flexible and principled manner, and perform reliable simulations. It can address realistic cases where one model may be more accurate than the others at different input values because the mixture weights, indicating the contribution of each model, are functions of the input. Inference on the calibration parameters can consider multiple computer models associated with different physics. The method does not require knowledge of the fidelity order of the models. We provide a technique able to mitigate the computational overhead due to the consideration of multiple computer models that is suitable to the mixture model framework. We implement the proposed method in a real-world application involving the Weather Research and Forecasting large-scale climate model.","['Georgios Karagiannis', 'Guang Lin']",786ac51c-ce8d-47cc-b578-3f0ca7e4a93f,0,"['1b9672da-4380-4f72-95fd-c07696a066a4', '1d94a763-f845-4b3f-b336-5a44255c7d23', '2b7fdb3d-d725-4ced-945e-9a27b34951f7', '2f19463a-73c4-492c-811b-1a37950353f3', '47a93521-1448-4694-9c00-f29ff91f9062', '6326237b-5ad4-41c1-a386-a3fa13c76306', '6fb2105f-fa9e-4d76-b8aa-b3f51dee46ff', '84af4764-df1b-41a8-af2c-50b4ba52c828', '86c4355d-7289-45eb-aa14-7eecdf2e8a5b', '8b806295-ecc3-4fe3-9e4e-38c3322fb20c', '91b2b282-15a8-4c00-b15d-9c1c5c0f9c18', '9bd56999-847a-40f9-beb3-fcd4210fd860', 'b45f7c4a-fcb5-4f56-b233-d7cffe63649e', 'c0c12213-d7d2-40f2-9540-cc57bd814c74', 'cd0d1c15-dd1b-468d-8938-442e4d9bc32c', 'd436aff2-f051-4ce3-b675-b718bfa30d34', 'fa3c4aa0-4aa0-4f1f-ac04-7087e568e36f']","On the Bayesian calibration of computer model mixtures through experimental data, and the design of predictive models",Journal of Computational Physics,2017
839,"Cloud computing offers various services to users by re-arranging storage and computing resources. In order to preserve data privacy, cloud users may choose to upload encrypted data rather than raw data to the cloud. However, processing and analyzing encrypted data are challenging problems, which have received increasing attention in recent years. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) was proposed to support computation on encrypted data and ensure data confidentiality simultaneously. However, a limitation of HE is it is a single user system, which means it only allows the party that owns a homomorphic decryption key to decrypt processed ciphertexts. Original HE cannot support multiple users to access the processed ciphertexts flexibly. In this paper, we propose a Privacy-Preserving Data Processing (PPDP) system with the support of a Homomorphic Re-Encryption Scheme (HRES). The HRES extends partial HE from a single-user system to a multi-user one by offering ciphertext re-encryption to allow multiple users to access processed ciphertexts. Through the cooperation of a Data Service Provider (DSP) and an Access Control Server (ACS), the PPDP system can support seven basic operations over ciphertexts, which include  Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Sign Acquisition, Comparison, Equivalent Test , and  Variance . To enhance the flexibility and security of our system, we further apply multiple ACSs to take in charge of the data from their own users and design computing operations over ciphertexts belonging to multiple ACSs. We then prove the security of PPDP, analyze its performance and advantages by comparing with some latest work, and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness through simulations with regard to big data process.","['Wenxiu Ding', 'Zheng Yan', 'Robert H.

840,"Recently, many meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed to serve as the basis of a  t -way test generation strategy (where  t  indicates the interaction strength) including Genetic Algorithms (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Simulated Annealing (SA), Cuckoo Search (CS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Harmony Search (HS). Although useful, meta-heuristic algorithms that make up these strategies often require specific domain knowledge in order to allow effective tuning before good quality solutions can be obtained. Hyper-heuristics provide an alternative methodology to meta-heuristics which permit adaptive selection and/or generation of meta-heuristics automatically during the search process. This paper describes our experience with four hyper-heuristic selection and acceptance mechanisms namely Exponential Monte Carlo with counter (EMCQ), Choice Function (CF), Improvement Selection Rules (ISR), and newly developed Fuzzy Inference Selection (FIS), using the  t -way test generation problem as a case study. Based on the experimental results, we offer insights on why each strategy differs in terms of its performance.","['Kamal Z. Zamli', 'Fakhrud Din', 'Graham Kendall', 'Bestoun S.

841,"A computer-aided detection (CAD) system is introduced in this paper for detection of breast lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). The proposed CAD system firstly compensates motion artifacts and segments the breast region. Then, the potential lesion voxels are detected and used as the initial seed points for the seeded region-growing algorithm. A new and robust region-growing algorithm incorporating with Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering and vesselness filter is proposed to segment any potential lesion regions. Subsequently, the false positive detections are reduced by applying a discrimination step. This is based on 3D morphological characteristics of the potential lesion regions and kinetic features which are fed to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The performance of the proposed CAD system is evaluated using the free-response operating characteristic (FROC) curve. We introduce our collected dataset that includes 76 DCE-MRI studies, 63 malignant and 107 benign lesions. The prepared dataset has been used to verify the accuracy of the proposed CAD system. At 5.29 false positives per case, the CAD system accurately detects 94% of the breast lesions.","['Shahriar B.

842,"In this paper we propose a heuristic convexity measure for 3D meshes. Built upon a state-of-the-art convexity measure that employs a time-consuming genetic algorithm for optimization, our new measure projects only once a given 3D mesh onto the orthogonal 2D planes along its principal directions for an initial estimation of mesh convexity, followed by a correction calculation based on mesh slicing. Our measure experimentally shows several advantages over the state-of-the-art one: first, it accelerates the overall computation by approximately an order of magnitude; second, it properly handles those bony meshes usually overestimated by the state-of-the-art measure; third, it improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art measure in 3D mesh retrieval.","['Rui Li', 'Lei Liu', 'Yun Sheng', 'Guixu Zhang']",16b858d6-b5c6-41d7-9637-f22ca85dd02f,50,"['0738792d-852b-4e15-b71e-9dee9de91973', '0e049938-b193-4330-a89b-041566318e40', '1cac500e-f94c-4681-80b9-306b0d0e7785', '46abaa57-199c-478f-bf3d-0cc22be9110a', '545946a3-b053-47cc-b2ee-655831e1fab7', '5ef103c2-669b-4308-a133-92875fe87358', '61010374-6bd5-4146-bc02-082f623dfd16', '67bf9ea0-5cfe-422c-b3b4-80fb6e071e3b', '6b40a2ed-9ef2-46d0-9fa2-ef99620e3bf5', '6d57190c-d56d-41f6-bd4b-41e959aafdb7', '73ff5526-9cc7-4382-8e10-e75341ae8ece', '853e507a-1a60-4020-addd-8c111621e503', 'a2af42ac-9adf-48cc-b25d-82dd61b54853', 'a639dd70-98ae-4dea-badf-b30523aa1233', 'b450598a-120e-4392-9a4a-7d5bb0925687', 'b62f7a11-4531-4db0-a401-8965867ea4bf', 'ba307583-2211-44d1-ae25-c785887c01be', 'be304ca4-7b8e-4e4f-bf32-1aa5da72591a', 'c4cbc03f-e40a-4b39-a2bd-1cd9afa75ace', 'e5db1adc-b005-4924-ae30-c3716cf91621', 'ea18d154-de4c-4976-beb4-3435f823e058']",A heuristic convexity measure for 3D meshes,The Visual Computer,2017
843,"Anomalies in data have traditionally been considered as nuisances whose presence, if ignored, can bring detrimental effects on the output of many data processing tasks. Nevertheless, in many situations anomalies correspond to events of interest and as such should be promptly identified before their presence is masked by the data preprocessing schemes being used to reduce the complexity of the main data processing task. This work develops a robust dictionary learning algorithm that exploits the notions of sparsity and local geometry of the data to identify anomalies while constructing sparse representations for the data. Sparsity is used to model the presence of anomalies in a dataset, and local geometry is exploited to better qualify a datum as an anomaly. The robust dictionary learning problem is cast as a regularized least-squares problem where sparsity-inducing and Laplacian regularization terms are used. Efficient iterative solvers based on block-coordinate descent and proximal gradient are developed to tackle the resulting joint dictionary learning and anomaly detection problems. The proposed framework is extended to address variations of classical dictionary learning and matrix factorization problems. Numerical tests on real datasets with artificial and real anomalies are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","['Pedro A.

844,"Achieving a high sustained simulation performance is the most important concern in the HPC community. To this end, many kinds of HPC system architectures have been proposed, and the diversity of the HPC systems grows rapidly. Under this circumstance, a vector-parallel supercomputer SX-ACE has been designed to achieve a high sustained performance of memory-intensive applications by providing a high memory bandwidth commensurate with its high computational capability. This paper examines the potential of the modern vector-parallel supercomputer through the performance evaluation of SX-ACE using practical engineering and scientific applications. To improve the sustained simulation performances of practical applications, SX-ACE adopts an advanced memory subsystem with several new architectural features. This paper discusses how these features, such as MSHR, a large on-chip memory, and novel vector processing mechanisms, are beneficial to achieve a high sustained performance for large-scale engineering and scientific simulations. Evaluation results clearly indicate that the high sustained memory performance per core enables the modern vector supercomputer to achieve outstanding performances that are unreachable by simply increasing the number of fine-grain scalar processor cores. This paper also discusses the performance of the HPCG benchmark to evaluate the potentials of supercomputers with balanced memory and computational performance against heterogeneous and cutting-edge scalar parallel systems.","['Ryusuke Egawa', 'Kazuhiko Komatsu', 'Shintaro Momose', 'Yoko Isobe', 'Akihiro Musa', 'Hiroyuki Takizawa', 'Hiroaki Kobayashi']",f24a2e6e-49e0-41be-84c5-ccf246fdeb1d,0,"['3529e6d3-1c7e-45cb-8ee7-cff6856ddfcc', '50b344b1-2f35-4c31-ae89-0c47835c868a', '70a461f1-2baa-45e2-a05c-c8993e09d455', '7fb56f9e-f2f6-4b66-a53a-57101462b8a4', 'ea1abb6e-a8d3-4cef-9fe4-a3e69c82a763', 'ffea7660-66c1-42ff-a489-8d76031b583d']",Potential of a modern vector supercomputer for practical applications: performance evaluation of SX-ACE,The Journal of Supercomputing,2017

848,"Ensemble strategy is important to develop a decomposition and ensemble method for multi-class classification problems. Most existing ensemble strategies use predetermined and heuristic decision rules. In this work, we build up the decision rules by optimizing decision directed acyclic graph (ODDAG) with classical and fuzzy decision trees to ensemble the posterior probabilities of binary classifiers from one-vs-one (OVO) or one-vs-all (OVA) decomposition strategies for multi-class classification problems. Four widely used extensible algorithms and ten decomposition and ensemble methods incorporating four binary classifiers (BCs) have been tested on 25 data sets. The empirical results show that the methods based on ensemble strategies using ODDAG are among the top methods that achieve the best performance in terms of two different measures.","['Ligang Zhou', 'Hamido Fujita']",83738859-e99c-4d03-b0fe-f2ba3f8067a4,50,"['103dcec7-3a0f-4a98-9d0c-f2cd98f1a5a1', '105eae3d-7269-42cf-92e7-aac1acef323a', '12fa9885-b0a9-4ea3-a0de-e020c333c3f0', '2457e3d8-b463-4f58-8e0e-84051604f17c', '4b1a9aac-bb58-43c2-9ee2-684818c24826', '4e939370-1e82-4317-af41-baebfdef9dc8', '5c95fb8e-0e2f-418b-908b-b28bc2c97289', '6311c293-aa3a-4441-bb11-e3b4418f6099', '63d57efd-eebd-4d25-9ca7-3191903a7387', '6bcf9140-ccda-4d3a-a449-734115f9250e', '7fbbef81-7c36-4a5d-9e92-e7c59e7b82b7', '8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498', '81386377-bab3-49f4-b139-36bb844bc2a7', 'a31d37b2-36f2-4ec8-9ee1-ba4603a95c6b', 'a87a768a-df1c-424b-b520-58a23d615ace', 'a8e38db2-2dfd-470b-b8fa-beaf36f6cebf', 'a9d59986-c229-4499-bec0-0b90d9a4a3fb', 'aa767a83-de19-4421-bfb4-f63808992758', 'b2292ab0-98c2-4dbe-a132-5d528251a029', 'c287f453-866d-4843-aafe-612cae89b085', 'c72332b6-92df-475f-8a8d-38119e9302ea', 'ca756b69-343b-4363-a9b7-7046fe3fe7d7', 'cdbd2ef9-d4b1-4dff-9037-3ea84627424d', 'cfee4a4c-03a9-4078-8e90-21ddf6ad44e5', 'db714c65-22b3-4ba9-bad5-9a1da0b9bf2b', 'e1443b0e-9621-455b-a458-b4930290a017', 'ee02a43f-e399-4e0a-a9f5-1e74fef69d18', 'f00fc370-0854-4967-bc6a-83b6c49da8bf', 'f33acc76-f25e-446f-a834-9d898907b326', 'feff8862-f47d-4591-a7cb-b62d7efc81a2']",Posterior probability based ensemble strategy using optimizing decision directed acyclic graph for multi-class classification,Information Sciences,2017
849,"The shielding of waves is an appropriate method to protect human beings, livestock, as well as structures and commercial goods from the harmful effects of dynamic loads. Areas of application of the concept of shielding range from ocean and coastal engineering, acoustics, to civil as well as mechanical engineering. Materials that can be effective in constructing shielding structural components and facilities are primarily cementitious composites as well as various categories of non-cementitious composites. However, the planning and production processes behind these low-cost materials is often characterized by uncertain information regarding their mechanical properties and even their dimensions. This leads to uncertainty in the forecasting of their overall performance, as well as their effectiveness in shielding incoming elastic, acoustic and water waves. In this paper, a new approach is presented which allows for improving these performance forecasts. In the proposed interdisciplinary procedure used here, the cost-effectiveness fuzzy analysis is connected to an appropriate mechanical model describing the shielding of elastic waves. This analysis procedure leads to a reduction of epistemic uncertainty. This can be achieved provided additional monetary investment is made, as proposed for the first time here, in order to improve the production quality of these shielding materials.","['Wolfgang Weber', 'Uwe Reuter']",4f73a1d9-fadb-4e00-b214-a154a2167853,0,"['2a6eba94-1434-46a0-a95a-b729a04d46eb', '9e45f2ce-7ac3-4cc3-a004-a5e0f329faa1', 'f005b019-2527-4348-bde4-0a27cf9bebc2']",Fuzzy modeling of wave-shielding under consideration of cost-effectiveness for an efficient reduction of uncertainty,Advances in Engineering Software,2017

852,"The study of the stability of a dynamical system described by a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) requires the computation of unstable states as the control parameter exceeds its critical threshold. Unfortunately, the discretization of the governing equations, especially for fluid dynamic applications, often leads to very large discrete systems. As a consequence, matrix based methods, like for example the Newton-Raphson algorithm coupled with a direct inversion of the Jacobian matrix, lead to computational costs too large in terms of both memory and execution time.#R##N##R##N#We present a novel iterative algorithm, inspired by Krylov-subspace methods, which is able to compute unstable steady states and/or accelerate the convergence to stable configurations. Our new algorithm is based on the minimization of the residual norm at each iteration step with a projection basis updated at each iteration rather than at periodic restarts like in the classical GMRES method. The algorithm is able to stabilize any dynamical system without increasing the computational time of the original numerical procedure used to solve the governing equations. Moreover, it can be easily inserted into a pre-existing relaxation (integration) procedure with a call to a single black-box subroutine.#R##N##R##N#The procedure is discussed for problems of different sizes, ranging from a small two-dimensional system to a large three-dimensional problem involving the Navier-Stokes equations. We also show that the proposed algorithm is able to improve the convergence of existing iterative schemes. In particular, the procedure is applied to the subcritical flow inside a lid-driven cavity. We also discuss the application of Boostconv to compute the unstable steady flow past a fixed circular cylinder (2D) and boundary-layer flow over a hemispherical roughness element (3D) for supercritical values of the Reynolds number. We also show that Boostconv can be used effectively with any spatial discretization, be it a finite-difference, finite-volume, finite-element or spectral method.","['Vincenzo Citro', 'Paolo Luchini', 'Flavio Giannetti', 'F.

853,"Despite the continuous development of features and mid-level representations, effectively and reliably measuring the similarity among images remains a challenging problem in image retrieval tasks. Once traditional measures consider only pairwise analysis, context-sensitive measures capable of exploiting the intrinsic manifold structure became indispensable for improving the retrieval performance. In this scenario, diffusion processes and rank-based methods are the most representative approaches. This paper proposes a novel hybrid method, named Rank Diffusion, which uses a diffusion process based on ranking information. The proposed method consists in a diffusion-based re-ranking approach, which propagates contextual information through a diffusion process defined in terms of top-ranked objects, reducing the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments considering a rigorous experimental protocol were conducted on six public image datasets and several different descriptors. Experimental results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that high effectiveness gains can be obtained, despite the low-complexity of the algorithm proposed.","['Daniel Carlos Guimarães Pedronette', 'Ricardo da Silva Torres']",81de3c31-f8d3-441d-8a0a-9dc2617c47da,0,"['07de599f-cbb5-4a4e-ad9d-6c3fd24e3839', '0fa97a6a-be12-47ef-9c9a-4a4424013b29', '12a3ddd6-eddd-4094-bc68-ef2a443ad844', '1f7e8ed9-87e7-4eb4-acf8-1fda07f5a164', '22b1f1a5-9442-417b-8401-f5ddb92a52ab', '24187b9b-fe6b-484d-9a0e-0b849362fa18', '25f25a03-6ac0-4d54-bfb5-9c160eba6dec', '2c4c35f1-3777-4606-b5d2-3a8383ab0df9', '2e71fa79-72e8-41ac-9b84-ea04720d7255', '2f4b854b-ba6c-44dd-93e6-717d6502d432', '37031566-2033-44cb-a87e-91a9bb37996f', '39563176-807a-413e-b961-aa895eaed429', '44c404a6-8ff0-4f7c-a9a6-ccac75574d78', '4d288a08-5eb2-458d-b19a-bc240029426a', '58a3e3b6-cb64-41f6-ae0a-69bc746e3aad', '5a166383-c9c0-4fc3-896f-d7649594a41f', '5be83099-f03c-46fa-9e3d-2eb6302713fa', '69c04cfe-f73a-49fa-9cf0-2c8b57e43e03', '6c38b3b4-7562-493d-a40c-fe70abf039a7', '7071f134-1bb9-47b0-99eb-cfbdd0295097', '73482330-09c0-435f-aac0-e15c4ecf5fb1', '73fb1440-2824-4563-9ca7-fe22894720b4', '7654ae63-7a25-43c8-92a6-d12dc86a6c1c', '82bdf18d-c7ee-47d8-bc08-826bb36b97a8', '831c8b74-edea-4365-b7ff-220dc03f5cd6', '83794d9d-1e72-4445-9185-28e9a9208e7b', '84bcafcc-3807-4a80-95c8-57aae4207a83', '86d7920e-e9f3-454a-84e9-a4ae801fbf6c', '8b271df3-35cb-4165-8b38-a3551457d972', '8fb3be1b-a32b-49b9-80b1-5a4d7ad895d1', '91dbe6e7-fd84-4026-b01f-746d0a118f27', '9317c8d0-b842-4cef-a111-b24fc66549e2', '9837abf2-827f-45e7-9d4c-033402cc2fa6', '9b5af39b-1c95-4581-9152-bba69d72976b', '9bd3b8dd-728e-4476-a3b8-f7b08f51bb78', '9c9562cb-34a8-4878-b212-2a4647af9b7e', '9d3752c1-1841-4ab7-994f-afde32f80814', '9e32e2ce-1a9f-4db6-8431-caefe95672f9', 'a10d6d12-a86f-4813-9dea-1d604c40a894', 'a15b4b92-1ccb-4ba2-8bce-1a9a10d10e16', 'a60d94e6-b4ac-4cc0-853c-e84b7ce9b3f4', 'a6a89312-ff0d-41e2-905a-fa0a86586c66', 'a9600c6e-d24c-46ef-a475-aad5523c3ca5', 'abce0747-e289-4b4f-ace3-ac4ee684abb3', 'aff96350-aab4-48f0-bebc-cb46170fda99', 'b592576f-ff29-4a68-9b2f-8a8ad02e9c70', 'b5ba437a-4805-4912-8ad6-dfec2f756485', 'bd091bc3-be9b-4cae-bb1f-df6e85d055b5', 'bed2eec1-48d4-4de0-a3e1-494c6e989bfe', 'bf248c6c-2c05-4101-9a38-35460518f9d7', 'c54d043d-8a89-4bad-a97f-068a6f01ecb5', 'c620449c-9417-48b8-aced-35ce036e1f96', 'c93eac1a-7d9a-48ab-9fb4-389c85bea00e', 'ca218a8c-7097-463e-9e79-2bbc7e4e4730', 'cad12af5-ca2e-451b-be65-022e20ff9172', 'd2089341-a7f5-4ba1-a752-d184d1dfc457', 'd9d437de-e451-427e-8829-e441ac2c43e0', 'da684d0c-5305-43cc-a91f-e4150930183f', 'e2204e92-e6dc-4884-9bbc-200029491fc7', 'e29fee25-bebe-4f73-84ae-a885c510a126', 'e902a2a2-ab00-4ea8-ad34-06fd140e510a', 'fa5acccf-03cb-4d88-bbc8-ba4c74d6a4dc', 'fb0e3629-2dab-4b4a-b943-11c3865023fe', 'fcc820ce-e667-47aa-8d7e-a5b484b587e7']",Unsupervised Rank Diffusion for Content-Based Image Retrieval,Neurocomputing,2017
854,"The notion of tangential cover, based on maximal segments, is a well-known tool to study the geometrical characteristics of a discrete curve. However, it is not robust to noise, while extracted contours from digital images typically contain noise, and this makes the geometric analysis tasks on such contours difficult. To tackle this issue, we investigate in this paper a discrete structure, named adaptive tangential cover (ATC), which is based on the notion of tangential cover and on a local noise estimator. More specifically, the ATC is composed of maximal segments with different widths deduced from the local noise values estimated at each point of the contour. Furthermore, a parameter-free algorithm is also presented to compute ATC. This study leads to the proposal of several applications of ATC on noisy digital contours: dominant point detection, contour length estimator, tangent/normal estimator, detection of convex and concave parts. An extension of ATC to 3D curves is also proposed in this paper. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this new notion.","['Phuc Ngo', 'Isabelle Debled-Rennesson', 'Bertrand Kerautret', 'Hayat Nasser']",0a253aee-aa97-405d-b031-65357af95617,0,"['06db828e-05c5-4768-b9f6-c92506acd7c9', '0f11e72a-87fc-49f6-8c75-0b9e4bdd5e0d', '159e6b0c-c4cf-46d6-9e0b-8d1f180d9328', '1a35ea75-9ec4-4a67-b217-17d6cff2e578', '2227e6b1-841f-4efd-b78a-b4ffc78af2df', '358fa590-3257-495e-8053-1e4ceeb1a247', '4aebaf0c-42e5-4ddb-a6cc-074bd6de0c71', '4f375152-01e4-4c68-9dca-6c305716739f', '500de035-f49c-494b-ba97-10a35728102a', '607065ef-e386-422b-82d1-bc150f9c8852', '71399fa9-a630-4f99-85a1-bf48185f4b0f', '7e4f2e8e-b46e-4f89-a1d3-688dc3b9d7fe', '9bbb74f7-cfa2-4011-8055-daba4f2dfdf7', '9c59d56e-a154-4115-bf98-9e82faf0a38a', '9cf9333c-0eeb-41e5-9e60-b64a20c35c6d', 'a7ba51f0-f084-45ca-8934-c4e865e774bd', 'aedd766d-46f5-415d-a6a8-a134d1141295', 'b0de27b1-a303-4130-8346-18ecc6e0052a', 'b6e6ff69-b310-4f45-8110-b7fdfcb971f8']",Analysis of Noisy Digital Contours with Adaptive Tangential Cover,Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision,2017
855,"In this study, we aim to build a robust correlation-based visual object tracking system. The function of traditional correlation filters for visual tracking is to search the most likely position of target by circularly shifting the search image patch. However, the search image patch needs to be large enough to cover both the object and background, which results in the algorithm being sensitive to changes in background. To alleviate this problem, we first propose an efficient object-surrounding histogram model to suppress the background. In this model, we build a Bayes classifier based on the initial given object, and we then apply it to each pixel in subsequent frames. With this model, the original image can be enhanced in order to eliminate the impact of circular shifting. Moreover, we develop a structural correlation filter that consists of both holistic and local object parts.

These interactions are detected information-theoretically and captured in two ways: via (i) directed networks (interaction diagrams) representing significant coupled dynamics between pairs of agents, and (ii) state-space plots (coherence diagrams) showing coherent structures in Shannon information dynamics. This model-free analysis relates, on the one hand, the information transfer to responsiveness of the agents and the team, and, on the other hand, the information storage within the team to the team's rigidity and lack of tactical flexibility. The resultant interaction and coherence diagrams reveal implicit interactions, across teams, that may be spatially long-range.

The gesture signature is computed using the optical flows in order to describe the location, velocity and orientation of the gesture global motion.

In the context of one-shot-learning, this model is applied to the recognition of gestures in videos. In this extreme case, the proposed framework achieves very interesting performance and remains independent from the moving object type, which suggest possible application to other motion-based recognition tasks.","['Selma Belgacem', 'Clément Chatelain', 'Thierry Paquet']",b8bce4c6-1410-4e3e-a598-9414ac3633c7,0,"['0b9e8081-3659-4cee-a98b-bbe1be55110f', '11cb036e-3726-4600-ab1d-76a56dc20ff9', '13d83701-8e72-482a-882e-fc1450146d6e', '1aca636b-df98-4fb1-83fc-ed6da2dc2437', '1c7f8375-10a5-4a46-b7e3-4b76ecf49b23', '2216afa1-4736-4aed-b400-bd487707d91f', '2a64f1f5-5f29-42d4-9925-c5e1f48191fd', '3595fa71-68db-476e-9cb7-ad6ece6f446e', '3f61d22f-00e0-4d6f-b24f-17782a33fd73', '55d2abf2-9cc4-4250-9882-7c1e03494ec7', '576b5bf2-46e6-4d6c-ad66-8a91e27f5abc', '57f75c88-515e-4bc8-b56b-ca739da37ad5', '7239649c-3f8d-46fd-932a-ae084ce79545', '72d6bab6-710b-48da-a347-b475545d13a1', '765ee573-6f11-452c-99ee-3ee1e96fad38', '78c1669a-bf46-4cca-b3bb-693251ee5e30', '806e8f8a-0d7a-462e-bfd1-315e7a3d6e75', '90f29a37-1b26-40ba-8a67-796bba3bee3c', '94821103-75da-4373-a624-e240eca2067b', '99ec6181-adab-4bcd-b06f-000e3e9cceff', 'a06589c7-aace-4771-ac74-6056f46eb00c', 'ac1e5ab6-3206-4658-9a14-3e91adc25232', 'ac89f3b0-40fb-4eb9-b101-a3fbd2eebb06', 'ae829318-5d10-461d-9c99-34a95a3f8732', 'cba7ae06-0ee4-47e4-a759-9c49d66451c2', 'dd83785a-dd19-41e3-9b25-ebabbd48d336', 'f12da0cd-0438-4da4-9d9d-93424621535c']",Gesture sequence recognition with one shot learned CRF/HMM hybrid model *,Image and Vision Computing,2017

Various solvents were evaluated and DMSO was identified as the most appropriate solvent, as it gave minimum Total Annual Cost (TAC) for desired purity. In case of pressure swing distillation, various pressure ranges were explored to achieve minimum TAC. Configurations for extractive and pressure swing distillation with heat integration were also worked out. The optimum designs of extractive and pressure swing distillation with and without heat integration were compared on a common basis of feed conditions and purity constraints. Results indicate that TAC of extractive distillation with heat integration is 5.2% less than that of PSD with partial heat integration.","['Pravin D. Ghuge', 'Nilesh A. Mali', 'Sunil S.

860,"In this paper, we present a novel method for harmonic-percussive sound separation (HPSS) by exploiting continuity/discontinuity properties in a matrix decomposition framework. It is widely accepted in the HPSS research that the harmonic and percussive components have anisotropic characteristics: The spectrum of the harmonic components and the time activation of the percussive components are sparse, whereas the spectrum of the percussive components and the time activation of the harmonic components are smooth. However, conventional methods fail to fully utilize the characteristics leading to suboptimal performance. Based on the observations that not the degree of sparseness but the degree of fluctuation is an accurate measure for distinguishing the harmonic and percussive components, we propose a novel HPSS algorithm by incorporating the continuity control in the iterative update formula of the matrix decomposition algorithm. In doing so, we first utilize probabilistic latent component analysis with Dirichlet prior, and later reformulate the algorithm in the nonnegative matrix factorization framework to reduce the computational cost. The comparative evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation.","['Jeong-Soo Park', 'Jaeyoung Shin', 'Kyogu Lee']",4942a596-c140-44b8-85c9-29fa0ecd597e,0,"['114c3f2a-e38a-4370-9e43-81cadae54232', '1fe12292-0c99-4ecb-b80c-f6aa4516a9c0', '227b281a-9709-4608-8f4e-53807e274113', '3647da95-2471-4feb-94a7-dc14e699c18c', '399d2aaa-5052-4419-9b68-2dfd3c9382e3', '47f39715-a3b9-4919-adf4-0ff64725906c', '4885d790-f096-4f28-8f1c-02bde1e0aa9e', '6baa54a1-9b98-45e1-8da4-04cd4d8a54b7', '705c94c7-5121-4bc1-8e86-a89473b11885', '83c0ad47-cbea-4a32-ad58-a9a65c576923', '8c3c2fd7-a548-47be-be9e-62994f0fb17a', '8d2dd473-b5a3-4d2b-b0ec-f3e576bcbc35', '8d4eb9e5-535d-4b9b-ad91-615c7a52ee80', 'a00aaeda-db40-407a-ba4a-661754c26fff', 'a411fc0d-6ce4-4fe6-a9be-3ef6c355556a', 'b37af347-0a60-45be-bbcd-34f7819d316b', 'bc309c04-833b-4bce-9b01-606249379c57', 'c4a734da-dab9-4ec7-a9ce-150175655d6d', 'd4a499dc-d01a-48bf-9c12-7cc6d231f60b', 'd97ffcae-c4fc-4a61-bb15-b427bd66c492', 'de8b2e58-3c66-4132-b996-956ed4373404', 'e9b017db-d3c6-4823-956e-63cf66aaf7a3', 'f7502311-6e57-46e3-818f-536a0ed3bf3f', 'f843771c-ac3e-4170-9126-25634468b604', 'fb321c23-975b-4a55-93fd-18203fc845fa']",Exploiting Continuity/Discontinuity of Basis Vectors in Spectrogram Decomposition for Harmonic-Percussive Sound Separation,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",2017
861,"Image segmentation and registration techniques have enabled biologists to place large amounts of volume data from fluorescence microscopy, morphed three-dimensionally, onto a common spatial frame. Existing tools built on volume visualization pipelines for single channel or red-green-blue (RGB) channels have become inadequate for the new challenges of fluorescence microscopy. For a three-dimensional atlas of the insect nervous system, hundreds of volume channels are rendered simultaneously, whereas fluorescence intensity values from each channel need to be preserved for versatile adjustment and analysis. Although several existing tools have incorporated support of multichannel data using various strategies, the lack of a flexible design has made true many-channel visualization and analysis unavailable. The most common practice for many-channel volume data presentation is still converting and rendering pseudosurfaces, which are inaccurate for both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Here, we present an alternative design strategy that accommodates the visualization and analysis of about 100 volume channels, each of which can be interactively adjusted, selected, and segmented using freehand tools. Our multichannel visualization includes a multilevel streaming pipeline plus a triple-buffer compositing technique. Our method also preserves original fluorescence intensity values on graphics hardware, a crucial feature that allows graphics-processing-unit (GPU)-based processing for interactive data analysis, such as freehand segmentation. We have implemented the design strategies as a thorough restructuring of our original tool, FluoRender. The redesign of FluoRender not only maintains the existing multichannel capabilities for a greatly extended number of volume channels, but also enables new analysis functions for many-channel data from emerging biomedical-imaging techniques.","['Yong Wan', 'Hideo Otsuna', 'Holly A.

In the majority of VMANET applications, an EM is propagated in the form of broadcasting. But, typical broadcasting schemes cause some problems, such as high network load, delayed multi-hop propagation, and absence of a range control function, and so on.

According to simulation results of highway traffic scenarios, the performance of proposed S&B and LCN protocols is better than that of the previous protocols in all areas and the number of forward messages is largely decreased in these proposed protocols.","['Soonju Park', 'Dong Chun Lee', 'Youngmi Kwon']",d0cd0f73-c75b-40c8-808f-c5221a9617df,0,"['0b50946c-c7bd-436e-b943-cf964498e3a8', '15d63b6e-db28-47fb-8c78-a7f91f5f77dc', '72018370-f0a0-4471-aa19-3fa31c994ee8', '76d95126-40a3-4625-83f4-820df82fe50e']",Improved protocols for spreading vehicle emergency messages in mobile ad hoc networks,Cluster Computing,2017

The main goal is to ascertain whether alternative assignment policies can improve global response to users’ demands, and to assess the performances of each alternative (scenario) compared to the current practice. We propose a mathematical model of user assignment to medico-social structures and professionals, under constraints of resource capacity, professionals’ skills and user requirements (formulated in an individual support project). With alternative assignment policies, users’ needs could be covered partially. They also authorize the involvement of several structures and several professionals in the response to the request. A mixed integer linear programming solver is used to solve this assignment problem, following a lexicographic approach in case of partial coverage policy. For some assignment policies that have long calculation times, we propose a simulated annealing approach in order to speed up the resolution. In order to validate simulated annealing approach, we compared it with a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure.

864,"Person re-identification is a crucial problem for video surveillance, aiming to discover the correct matches for a probe person image from a set of gallery person images. To directly describe the image pair, we present a novel organization of polynomial kernel feature map in a high dimensional feature space to break down the variability of positive person pairs. An exemplar-guided similarity function is built on the map, which consists of multiple sub-functions. Each sub-function is associated with an “exemplar” image being responsible for a particular type of image pair, thus excels at separating the persons with similar appearance. We formulate a unified learning problem including a relaxed loss term as well as two kinds of regularization strategies particularly designed for the feature map. The corresponding optimization algorithm jointly optimizes the coefficients of all the sub-functions and selects the proper exemplars for a better discrimination. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on six public datasets, where we thoroughly analyze the contribution of each component and verify the generalizability of our approach by cross-dataset experiments. Results show that the new method can achieve consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.","['Dapeng Chen', 'Zejian Yuan', 'Jingdong Wang', 'Chen B', 'Gang Hua', 'Nanning Zheng']",9514fb44-7db8-4bf7-b4a2-748c13fdc76d,0,"['106cd86b-923a-42f5-aae6-0e80b8480b19', '25ae07f9-dc46-43db-a183-c85da46257bb', '3c219668-67ae-4c42-a6fc-cc9a24482c8e', '52ecb0b8-d066-463c-8847-ad632c483ca9', '5965ec81-fe04-48a3-b573-f61f80708ea1', '635e578f-e047-4d23-b17f-cda65d475736', '662951e8-93c0-4229-9188-cf8d302a792b', '6a9efb05-1ab9-4733-9d0e-4ad676c8c4d1', '87953b2a-c855-45fd-876f-df021b018e5c', '936ea7c7-0d10-461a-b7c0-c33c976708b1', '9ae350c9-cfbc-496b-8da4-92c6b6c13f31', 'a5edb836-7abb-48f2-8cf0-2747b8959295', 'ce90adda-7c60-451f-a617-78822d4a5ef4', 'e1bc3e1a-3f08-427f-8676-ca67531fc8ec', 'e2204e92-e6dc-4884-9bbc-200029491fc7', 'e537d143-155e-4ca0-8ae8-66b777a77fea', 'f36062af-f993-4ff5-9a4e-487391d3396d']",Exemplar-Guided Similarity Learning on Polynomial Kernel Feature Map for Person Re-identification,International Journal of Computer Vision,2017
865,"Today, sequencing is frequently carried out by Massive Parallel Sequencing (MPS) that cuts drastically sequencing time and expenses. Nevertheless, Sanger sequencing remains the main validation method to confirm the presence of variants. The analysis of MPS data involves the development of several bioinformatic tools, academic or commercial. We present here a statistical method to compare MPS pipelines and test it in a comparison between an academic (BWA-GATK) and a commercial pipeline (TMAP-NextGENe®), with and without reference to a gold standard (here, Sanger sequencing), on a panel of 41 genes in 43 epileptic patients. This method used the number of variants to fit log-linear models for pairwise agreements between pipelines. To assess the heterogeneity of the margins and the odds ratios of agreement, four log-linear models were used: a full model, a homogeneous-margin model, a model with single odds ratio for all patients, and a model with single intercept. Then a log-linear mixed model was fitted considering the biological variability as a random effect. Among the 390,339 base-pairs sequenced, TMAP-NextGENe® and BWA-GATK found, on average, 2253.49 and 1857.14 variants (single nucleotide variants and indels), respectively. Against the gold standard, the pipelines had similar sensitivities (63.47% vs. 63.42%) and close but significantly different specificities (99.57% vs. 99.65%; p < 0.001). Same-trend results were obtained when only single nucleotide variants were considered (99.98% specificity and 76.81% sensitivity for both pipelines). The method allows thus pipeline comparison and selection. It is generalizable to all types of MPS data and all pipelines.","['Mad-Hélénie Elsensohn', 'N.

868,"The fault-tolerance property in most cloud storage systems are designed within the scale of a single datacenter. The single datacenter as a whole may be unreachable or crashed due to severe problems, such as broken network links, power supply interruptions, and natural disasters, etc. Therefore, the design of an effective cross-datacenter fault-tolerant storage system is important to protect data security in the cloud. However, building a cross-datacenter fault-tolerant system faces great challenges, such as high latency, low throughput, high costs of bandwidth resources between datacenters. In this paper, we propose a practical cross-datacenter fault-tolerant (CDFT) algorithm in the cloud storage system. Our fault-tolerant algorithm design considers the difficult tradeoffs among fault tolerance, latency, throughput, network and storage costs. We propose the Domain Fault Codes (DFC) and the topology-aware scheduling techniques, which can tolerate the whole datacenter breakdown. We implemented the DFC-CDFT algorithm in a prototype cloud storage system. The experimental results showed that the proposed DFC-CDFT algorithm can effectively recover data blocks from the single datacenter failure while achieves low storage and bandwidth costs.","['Yuxia Cheng', 'Xinjie Yu', 'Wenzhi Chen', 'Rui Chang', 'Yang Xiang']",023e3df3-3b74-41a5-9d97-d5344503cd9f,0,"['00da3f9a-96b0-4492-ab27-1ba7a93760e8', '0ee75d47-93a4-49cc-95b5-feba7126d8cf', '3d0e9f58-8fff-4cf0-8545-f5d801325361', '49718fad-7c41-4c12-8f14-1b91120caf5e', '4f818994-f879-437c-8171-9f5655bb420b', '5002dd27-9ce6-4abb-a3d0-2ac112f58c37', '509625c3-0fcd-44fe-aaa9-5726ae9bb09c', '62abb919-0e1f-47ec-9888-cfafce0be3a0', '6d0ec530-fcd1-4396-bf4d-bd87c7fbaa70', '75eb5f1c-a6ee-4425-ba73-5c6e030a42d7', '90075001-92bc-4e61-a465-e10c13871c6f', '94fd02f8-ec21-45de-8ce2-3f129c2162c2', 'ae66a1c2-0279-4edb-9a86-456c859283b7', 'cb2a9e60-f200-473c-a099-aaabc1e9b95b', 'ce62e560-1792-4501-a403-5c1a9afc3ff4', 'f21b0099-079f-4d46-b975-c00d24bc300d', 'f68a459a-fb53-4d83-af1f-f104313f5508']",A practical cross-datacenter fault-tolerance algorithm in the cloud storage system,Cluster Computing,2017

Although the majority of cases can be managed by preventive care, most consumers opt for more expensive curative care that leads to a substantial increase in overall costs.

871,"This paper presents a new data-driven adaptive computational model for simulating turbulent flow, where partial-but-incomplete measurement data is available. The model automatically adjusts the closure coefficients of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)   k−ω     k  −  ω        turbulence equations to improve agreement between the simulated flow and the measurements. This data-driven adaptive RANS   k−ω     k  −  ω        (D-DARK) model is validated with 3 canonical flow geometries: pipe flow, backward-facing step, and flow around an airfoil. For all test cases, the D-DARK model improves agreement with experimental data in comparison to the results from a non-adaptive RANS   k−ω     k  −  ω        model that uses standard values of the closure coefficients. For the pipe flow, adaptation is driven by mean stream-wise velocity data from 42 measurement locations along the pipe radius, and the D-DARK model reduces the average error from 5.2% to 1.1%. For the 2-dimensional backward-facing step, adaptation is driven by mean stream-wise velocity data from 100 measurement locations at 4 cross-sections of the flow. In this case, D-DARK reduces the average error from 40% to 12%. For the NACA 0012 airfoil, adaptation is driven by surface-pressure data at 25 measurement locations. The D-DARK model reduces the average error in surface-pressure coefficients from 45% to 12%.","['Zhiyong Li', 'Huaibao Zhang', 'Sean Bailey', 'Jesse B.

These models include; time of arrival (TOA), time difference of arrival (TDOA), direction of arrival (DOA), and received signal strength. TOA and TDOA based localization can offer a very good accuracy than the other types. In this paper, the cooperative TOA localization with virtual anchors selection is proposed in order to increase the accuracy of the localization procedure. The proposed cooperative TOA procedure is explained and mathematically analyzed based on linear least square algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed cooperative TOA can reduce the mean square positioning error. Furthermore, it is more tolerable to noise and errors than the ordinary TOA. In addition, it can provide a 3 dB performance over the ordinary TOA method.","['Mohamed Shalaby', 'Mona Shokair', 'Nagy W.

878,"We consider a cellular scenario in which a base-station primary transmitter communicates to its primary receivers (PRs) using a set of multiple antenna relay stations (RS). One of several RS that is selected is assumed to employ antenna selection. The primary network allows one of its users to access the secondary network simultaneously in the same two phases (by using a selected RS) through dynamic spectrum sharing principles. Such a framework allows the cellular system to increase its frequency utilization. We derive expressions for the outage and ergodic rate performance of such spectrum sharing communication links. Systems performing spectrum sharing are assumed to have a peak power constraint and use peak interference control (to limit interference to the PR). For a fixed primary outage, it is demonstrated that increasing the number of users improves the performance at medium values of SNR, whereas increasing the number of RSs improves the performance at high SNRs.","['Arnav Mohan', 'Shankar Prakriya']",b113d587-127d-454e-9d0d-9f59be89e3f5,0,"['1382645e-321c-455e-83c7-0502407e0cae', '5ef20465-b60b-4dd9-bbde-5800201cb2d7', '7d1731c4-c548-4eff-9b8b-341b2db01cf8', '86310bcf-bc8a-4571-961f-77552ad28971', '92b6d6f4-82e2-4bc2-b70d-f2e10e0e5ace', 'b0e183dd-a703-4d68-a9e2-3f4433d0d908', 'c905fb3c-7ccc-4b53-9e65-56b8dd2cc868']",Performance of a Relay Antenna Selection Based Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Protocol with Opportunistic Selection of Users,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

880,"Aging causes foot arches to collapse, possibly leading to foot deformities and falls. This paper proposes a set of measures involving an entropy-based method used for two groups of young adults with dissimilar foot arches to explore and quantize postural stability on a force plate in an upright position. Fifty-four healthy young adults aged 18–30 years participated in this study. These were categorized into two groups: normal (37 participants) and flatfooted (17 participants). We collected the center of pressure (COP) displacement trajectories of participants during upright standing, on a force plate, in a static position, with eyes open (EO), or eyes closed (EC). These nonstationary time-series signals were quantized using entropy-based measures and traditional measures used to assess postural stability, and the results obtained from these measures were compared. The appropriate combinations of entropy-based measures revealed that, with respect to postural stability, the two groups differed significantly (p < 0.05) under both EO and EC conditions. The traditional commonly-used COP-based measures only revealed differences under EO conditions. Entropy-based measures are thus suitable for examining differences in postural stability for flatfooted people, and may be used by clinicians after further refinement.","['Tsui-Chiao Chao', 'Bernard C.

881,"It is important to ensure the efficient supply of land ecosystem services when the competition for land is increasing. In this paper we simulated the ecosystem services function under two scenarios, including carbon sequestration, agricultural production, water and soil conservation, and analyzed the tradeoffs among these ecosystem services in Guanzhong-Tianshui region from 2000 to 2050. Then the productive efficiency of ecosystem services was assessed under two scenarios and compared their production possibility frontiers (PPFs). Through the simulation analysis of their optimum allocation, we also provide the scientific evidence to the development of ecosystem. The natural rules were revealed that if these trade-offs emphasize the potential to sequester carbon in the landscape, along with very little loss of agricultural production, much more water is used. It could be identified to adhere to combine the exploitation and utilization, remediation and protection for land to promote the effective circulation of land eco-system, and meet the society’s preferences for land ecosystem service function by adjusting the use of multiple eco-services.","['Zixiang Zhou', 'Jing Li', 'Zhengfeng Guo', 'Ting Li']",87a91552-13aa-41e4-89b2-e1d04fa5e452,0,['468f750a-ed64-47f1-a2ff-32736211f2c2'],"Trade-offs between carbon, water, soil and food in Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region from remotely sensed data",International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2017

883,"Determining the position of the sensor node is the ultimate challenging one in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which may perhaps lead a large localization error. To tackle this tricky, a novel Semi Definite Programming (SDP)—Multiplier method is proposed using time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurement in asynchronous networks. The SDP relaxation method is derived to prevaricate the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) convergence problem that will result in Lagrangian problem. Consequently, this problem can be optimally solved in a stress-free method which provides the value of multipliers. In this Relax and cut scheme, Lagrangian multiplier added in the objective function which gives the minimum value of the function that fulfills the relaxed constraints and reduce the execution time. Also to monitor the mobile target and to improve the energy of sensors, an optimization framework of selective approach algorithm has been used. The simulation result demonstrates that the proposed algorithm provides a better position estimation with less localization error and energy consumption.","['Z. Mary Livinsa', 'S.

884,"Performing continuous beam steering, from planar arrays of high-order differential microphones, is not trivial. The main problem is that shape-preserving beams can be steered only in a finite set of privileged directions, which depend on the position and the number of physical microphones. In this letter, we propose a simple and computationally inexpensive method for alleviating this problem using planar microphone arrays. Given two identical reference beams pointing in two different directions, we show how to build a beam of nearly constant shape, which can be continuously steered between such two directions. The proposed method, unlike the diffused steering approaches based on linear combinations of eigenbeams (spherical harmonics), is applicable to planar arrays also if we deal with beams characterized by high-order polar patterns. Using the coefficients of the Fourier series of the polar patterns, we also show how to find a tradeoff between shape invariance of the steered beam, and maximum angular displacement between the two reference beams. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method through the analysis of models based on first-, second-, and third-order differential microphones.","['Alberto Bernardini', ""Matteo D'Aria"", 'Roberto Sannino', 'Augusto Sarti']",87794a6c-ce7f-4ca2-bf83-983c57d7e4c3,0,"['09079795-f393-4f19-b9ac-97ce447161f1', '0e1dd3d9-a684-474a-828b-9c2595b3ca33', '0f40e100-b93f-4431-b414-bfaa5c1f56ab', '3aef9ea0-53da-465c-bb78-386970461f86', '5ae4ef7f-b13a-4e78-8afd-1e2d22259b87', '7c233e57-09bb-497e-a9e6-bb31607d51c5', '88e1c126-36a9-4fc0-8a9b-3a88ff586e91', '8d86576c-fb3d-49b3-99c6-fa9d9acce3c8', '938cb274-562c-4f9a-96ae-2f3f326898c1', 'c8f19651-37da-4a33-a4fc-d11e857f6588']",Efficient Continuous Beam Steering for Planar Arrays of Differential Microphones,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,2017
885,"Feature noise, namely noise on inputs is a long-standing plague to support vector machine(SVM). Conventional SVM with the hinge loss(C-SVM) is sparse but sensitive to feature noise. Instead, the pinball loss SVM(pin-SVM) enjoys noise robustness but loses the sparsity completely.

It provides a flexible framework of trade-off between sparsity and feature noise insensitivity. Theoretical properties including Bayes rule, misclassification error bound, sparsity, and noise insensitivity are discussed in depth.

The adaptation and fitness evaluation processes drive the global search for a more competent ANN classifier. A winning ANN is identified from the global search. Then, the Scaled Conjugate Backpropagation algorithm, which is a local search, is performed to further train the winning ANN to obtain a precise solution. The performance of the proposed classification model is evaluated rigorously; its performance is compared with the baseline ANNs of the proposed model as well as other classifiers.

888,"In this article we present algorithms for computing large matchings in 3-regular graphs, graphs with maximum degree 3, and 3-connected planar graphs. The algorithms give a guarantee on the size of the computed matching and take linear or slightly superlinear time. Thus they are faster than the best-known algorithm for computing maximum matchings in general graphs, which runs in  O (s nm ) time, where  n  denotes the number of vertices and  m  the number of edges of the given graph. For the classes of 3-regular graphs and graphs with maximum degree 3, the bounds we achieve are known to be best possible.   We also investigate graphs with block trees of bounded degree, where the  d -block tree is the adjacency graph of the  d -connected components of the given graph. In 3-regular graphs and 3-connected planar graphs with bounded-degree 2- and 4-block trees, respectively, we show how to compute  maximum  matchings in slightly superlinear time.","['Ignaz Rutter', 'Alexander Wolff']",83eee7e7-6a7a-4b58-b994-4340bc4be691,50,"['0295a882-31be-4b9f-81cb-81d04660413e', '128f2e8a-dcf5-46fb-8682-1c0d137f5078', '1dd916f1-ca84-45a9-98a7-cbf6d5ae8016', '274aa0f3-67e0-4baf-8d2d-1fb24151d619', '2fde2076-cfe5-46a2-8f66-1282d1084e1d', '3b61b522-5347-4b4d-97bc-2bf4d38ec976', '5639eb69-0991-4660-b97e-83e31dd98686', '5a6dd4be-0c5d-407d-b3f1-2a50bb467344', '6896c184-cfa6-4d34-b0d7-fa8d4bd42ba3', '8bdc56d5-11d6-4eea-9148-46602e643c5d', '98ac769c-90b3-4d2a-8a41-4363cd1a432e', 'da298d1b-b8bb-45d9-bb5f-8cbb4455ba41', 'db781023-0ffd-4441-bb0a-84fc487c2edf', 'e1e95cfd-76f7-479c-8a39-ab711d18fd7c', 'f57f30b6-f46a-472e-ae00-ff074e7839ae', 'f8641483-b691-45b6-b356-17909e61135b']",Computing large matchings fast,ACM Transactions on Algorithms,2010
889,"This paper analyzes the electric-and-gasoline vehicle market under two different structures: monopoly and duopoly. Taking social welfare into account, the government offers a subsidy incentive scheme or a price discount incentive scheme to buyers of electric vehicles (EVs) to promote the adoption of EVs. We formulate a utility model composed of a population of consumers who make utility maximizing choices and manufacturers who set an optimal pricing that responds to the interventions of the government. Using this model, a framework for policy makers to find optimal subsidies or optimal price discount rates is developed. Unlike the monotonic relation in the monopoly setting, in the duopoly setting the relationship between consumers’ low-carbon awareness and EVs’ demand depends on the government’s policy. Although the demand for EVs, the consumer surplus, the environmental impact, and the social welfare are identical under two incentive schemes, the government prefers to implement a subsidy incentive scheme due to the lower expenditure involved. Furthermore, under a subsidy incentive scheme, EVs’ market in the monopoly setting has a smaller environmental impact than that in the duopoly setting. From the numerical tests, we show that results of social welfare comparison under two market structures depends on unit environmental impact of EV.","['Lulu Shao', 'Jun Yang', 'Min Zhang']",66ec7a28-b80f-4bfb-bbf9-15998223167d,0,"['037d2285-bfad-456c-8f49-0b875c7f1417', '1a9ef143-0ac4-4fa2-944c-9a9730c89401', '26a1604f-fbdf-43be-a0c7-4b0bb4a3ef28', '2a74304c-9987-4bc1-b33b-4b7c99e496cf', '382564a7-34e9-4599-a882-8f77b7c3effd', '3d0fa5d3-ba56-48ba-95c0-275216dfd30e', '44b2f619-ed63-4855-90c8-4956e52e2efe', '49558b0f-9339-46bb-bd83-87cd5033dd25', '530b7797-fa03-453c-85d4-139c9981fb85', '91b3ccb6-165d-4e1b-99c1-7038e21fc184', '9770bb43-be8f-4095-98bf-e2caee1f356e', '98143cc0-bde4-4835-8615-d24799e436d3', 'a57a423e-1638-4b1d-b181-687d0bc9ac56', 'b0b6e618-4bbb-48e5-822f-8a8d2505a212', 'be94c823-d507-43d1-8a64-07cfc6cd5dd8', 'ca97980c-a124-468b-bdae-b2fab3d77440', 'ebdfc799-5d46-48e4-8f81-dba2944a6c63', 'ee2c3124-6da2-4f18-9352-77e189218d23']",Subsidy scheme or price discount scheme?

The algorithm includes explicit expressions for Mie expansion coefficients inside the sphere and calculation of the vector spherical harmonics in terms of the Riccati–Bessel functions and their logarithmic derivatives.

Scattnlay 2.0 will be the first publicly available (at GitHub, https://github.com/ovidiopr/scattnlay) program, based on the Mie theory, which can calculate near-fields for the general case of a multilayer sphere. Several tests were designed to verify that the results obtained with our code match literature results and those obtained through similar programs (limited to core-shell structures) or full-wave 3D simulations. These tests demonstrate that the implementation is effective, yielding accurate values of electric and magnetic fields for a wide range of size parameters, number of layers, and refractive indices.#R##N#Program summary#R##N#Program title: scattnlay 2.0#R##N##R##N#Catalogue identifier: AEEY_v2_0#R##N##R##N#Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEEY_v2_0.html#R##N##R##N#Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N.

Therefore, pulmonary rehabilitation exercises and patient management for extensive periods of time are required. This paper presents a remote rehabilitation system for a multimodal sensors-based application for patients who have chronic breathing difficulties. The process involves the fusion of sensory data—captured motion data by stereo-camera and photoplethysmogram signal by a wearable PPG sensor—that are the input variables of a detection and evaluation framework. In addition, we incorporated a set of rehabilitation exercises specific for pulmonary patients into the system by fusing sensory data. Simultaneously, the system also features medical functions that accommodate the needs of medical professionals and those which ease the use of the application for patients, including exercises for tracking progress, patient performance, exercise assignments, and exercise guidance. Finally, the results indicate the accurate determination of pulmonary exercises from the fusion of sensory data.

894,"In this paper we present the Large Crater Clustering (LCC) tool set, an ArcGIS plugin that supports the quantitative approximation of a primary impact location from user-identified locations of possible secondary impact craters or the long-axes of clustered secondary craters. The identification of primary impact craters directly supports planetary geologic mapping and topical science studies where the chronostratigraphic age of some geologic units may be known, but more distant features have questionable geologic ages. Previous works (e.g., McEwen et al., 2005; Dundas and McEwen, 2007) have shown that the source of secondary impact craters can be estimated from secondary impact craters. This work adapts those methods into a statistically robust tool set. We describe the four individual tools within the LCC tool set to support: (1) processing individually digitized point observations (craters), (2) estimating the directional distribution of a clustered set of craters, back projecting the potential flight paths (crater clusters or linearly approximated catenae or lineaments), (3) intersecting projected paths, and (4) intersecting back-projected trajectories to approximate the local of potential source primary craters. We present two case studies using secondary impact features mapped in two regions of Mars. We demonstrate that the tool is able to quantitatively identify primary impacts and supports the improved qualitative interpretation of potential secondary crater flight trajectories.","['Jason Laura', 'James A.

898,"The abundant data parallelism available in many-core GPUs has been a key interest to improve accuracy in scientific and engineering simulation. In many cases, most of the simulation time is spent in linear solver involving sparse matrix–vector multiply. In forward petroleum oil and gas reservoir simulation, the application of a stencil relationship to structured grid leads to a family of generalized hepta-diagonal solver matrices with some regularity and structural uniqueness. We present a customized storage scheme that takes advantage of generalized hepta-diagonal sparsity pattern and stencil regularity by optimizing both storage and matrix–vector computation. We also present an in-kernel optimization for implementing sparse matrix–vector multiply (SpMV) and biconjugate gradient stabilized (BiCG-Stab) solver. In-kernel is intended to avoid the multiple kernels invocation associated with the use of the numerical library operators. To keep in-kernel, a lock-free inter-block synchronization is used in which completing thread blocks are assigned some independent computations to avoid repeatedly polling the global memory. Other optimizations enable combining reductions and collective write operations to memory. The in-kernel optimization is particularly useful for the iterative structure of BiCG-Stab for preserving vector data locality and to avoid saving vector data back to memory and reloading on each kernel exit and re-entry. Evaluation uses generalized hepta-diagonal matrices that derives from a range of forward reservoir simulation’s structured grids. Results show the profitability of proposed generalized hepta-diagonal custom storage scheme over standard library storage like compressed sparse row, hybrid sparse, and diagonal formats. Using proposed optimizations, SpMV and BiCG-Stab have been noticeably accelerated compared to other implementations using multiple kernel exit–re-entry when the solver is implemented by invoking numerical library operators.","['Mayez A.

901,"The human placenta is essential for the supply of the fetus. To monitor the fetal development, imaging data is acquired using (US). Although it is currently the gold-standard in fetal imaging, it might not capture certain abnormalities of the placenta. (MRI) is a safe alternative for the in utero examination while acquiring the fetus data in higher detail. Nevertheless, there is currently no established procedure for assessing the condition of the placenta and consequently the fetal health. Due to maternal respiration and inherent movements of the fetus during examination, a quantitative assessment of the placenta requires fetal motion compensation, precise placenta segmentation and a standardized visualization, which are challenging tasks. Utilizing advanced motion compensation and automatic segmentation methods to extract the highly versatile shape of the placenta, we introduce a novel visualization technique that presents the fetal and maternal side of the placenta in a standardized way. Our approach enables physicians to explore the placenta even in utero. This establishes the basis for a comparative assessment of multiple placentas to analyze possible pathologic arrangements and to support the research and understanding of this vital organ. Additionally, we propose a three-dimensional structure-aware surface slicing technique in order to explore relevant regions inside the placenta. Finally, to survey the applicability of our approach, we consulted clinical experts in prenatal diagnostics and imaging. We received mainly positive feedback, especially the applicability of our technique for research purposes was appreciated.","['Haichao Miao', 'Gabriel Mistelbauer', 'Alexey Karimov', 'Amir Alansary', 'Alice Davidson', 'David Lloyd', 'Mellisa Damodaram', 'Lisa Story', 'Jana Hutter', 'Joseph V.

902,"A link between maladaptive personality traits and an excessive use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) has been documented. However, the role of schizotypal personality traits in MMORPG use is understudied. The aim of this study was to explore the potential links between schizotypal traits, motivations for playing MMORPGs, and symptoms of problematic MMORPG use. Eighty-three MMORPG gamers were enrolled in the study. They filled out questionnaires measuring schizotypal personality traits and an adapted version of the same scale designed to measure in-game schizotypal traits. All participants also filled out questionnaires assessing motivations for gaming and disordered use of MMORPGs. Results of the study showed that the disorganized and interpersonal traits of schizotypy decreased when participants were thinking about themselves in the virtual world. Schizotypal traits, together with achievement and immersion motives, predicted problematic use of MMORPGs. The findings of this study may suggest that schizotypal traits and motivations for playing can interact and play a pivotal role in the onset and maintenance of problematic gaming.","['Adriano Schimmenti', 'Alexandre Infanti', 'Deborah Myriam Badoud', 'Julien Laloyaux', 'Joël Billieux']",fc34ec5d-0471-45a7-9247-1a7490680b5a,0,"['2ca71aea-bb8d-4952-b348-a9f2fdd713ca', '2fc0eceb-0cc6-47a2-8006-12a7c74a35d5', '60a78084-b07d-4444-86ba-ac4f59da8319', '71aa7848-c618-41df-b151-811fceaa9374', '7a6f657b-3930-4dcc-8e87-8bb9f4402939', '88ec62ec-1119-47df-aca9-f768a2e95938', '8c109147-9fd4-4400-b092-0551d051b4a9', 'b89ebbb7-4f45-43db-b91d-95210eb9e622', 'bf462eca-ceb0-4533-b1d7-4d96a6824542', 'bf5f183b-a47e-4467-b440-716aa1de9427', 'd6bebb4b-30cd-4f31-95df-6387f69deb4b', 'f0809f3e-c163-4310-ad3a-acde159eb86f']",Schizotypal personality traits and problematic use of massively-multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs),Computers in Human Behavior,2017
903,"Smart control access to any service and/or critical data is at the very basis of any smart project. Biometrics have been used as a solution for system access control, for many years now. However, the simple use of biometrics cannot be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are related to the data transmission method between the medias, where the users require access and the servers where the biometric data, captured upon registration, are stored. In this paper, we use smart cards as an effective yet efficient solution to this critical data storage problem. Furthermore, iris texture has been used as a human identifier for some time now. This biometric is considered one of the most reliable to distinguish a person from another as its unique yet perfectly stable over time. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of iris texture verification on smart cards. For this implementation, the matching is done on-card. Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner’s card, guaranteeing the maximum security and privacy. In a first approach, the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are improved using circular translations of the matched iris codes. However, after a thorough analysis of the achieved results, we show that the proposed method introduces a significant increase in terms of execution time of the matching operation. In order to mitigate this impact, we augmented the proposed technique with acceptance threshold verification, thus decreasing drastically the execution time of the matching operation, and yet achieving considerably low FAR and FRR. It is noteworthy to point out that these characteristics are at the basis of any access control successful usage.","['Nadia Nedjah', 'Rafael Soares Wyant', 'Luiza de Macedo Mourelle', 'B. B.

A memory-efficient algorithm for automated mechanism generation is presented for coping with this combinatorial complexity. The algorithm selects normalized flux as a metric to identify unimportant species during model generation and prunes them with their reactions, without any loss of accuracy. The new algorithm reduces memory requirements for building kinetic models with 200–300 species by about a factor of 4, or for fixed computer hardware makes it possible to create models including about twice as many species as was previously possible. The increased capability opens the possibility of discovering unexplored reaction networks and modeling more complicated reacting systems.","['Kehang Han', 'William H. Green', 'Richard H.

The proposed ACS-SA and EACS-SA algorithms often generate solutions of better quality than the ACS and EACS, respectively. Moreover, the EACS-SA algorithm combined with the proposed SOP-3-exchange-SA local search was able to find 10 new best solutions for the SOP instances from the SOPLIB2006 repository, thus improving the state-of-the-art results as known from the literature.

906,"Every four years, the 10 national teams members of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) compete for one of the South American slots in the final phase of the FIFA World Cup. The qualifying competition consists of a double round robin tournament. The matches are scheduled in 9 closely spaced pairs known as double rounds. Every team plays twice in each double round. The tournament is spread over 2 years, so the double rounds are months apart. After using the same mirrored schedule for about twenty years, and persistent complaints from its members, CONMEBOL decided to change the schedule for the 2018 World Cup. Supported by one of CONMEBOL’s members, we used integer programming to construct schedules that overcome the main drawbacks of the previous approach. After exploring many design criteria, we proposed a candidate schedule based on a French scheme. The main feature of the proposed schedule is that every team plays once at home and once away on each double round, a departure from traditional symmetric (mirrored) schemes. This proposal was unanimously approved by CONMEBOL members and is currently being used in the qualifier tournament for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.","['Guillermo Durán', 'Mario Guajardo', 'Denis Saure']",e979f769-a5ef-47c6-91d2-eca9d7a271fd,0,"['00c2d4a8-f1f5-4567-896a-87cb10d1156f', '03b5419e-e4f5-4036-84f6-613d60e0c391', '068a78ac-582d-4f58-94df-0ef3a6cc36b9', '0a9eaa32-765e-43e9-9ac2-6a889d8b50c2', '4800229d-c159-44f1-9eca-de9d4d025ff5', '4d2c2dea-aa42-4859-bfdd-2af5dfc7744b', '54ebb06d-3f54-4a34-bafd-f9eaf78e9077', '5996437a-eef7-4b22-a681-f90ba9abcc68', '7d3a1808-cb15-473e-9087-9b311806a16b', '8aafb211-f9e3-4def-8a65-b9afe26c765e', '90b306a3-3f5d-4883-9ce5-5600caca3793', 'c16889aa-e058-495b-bff6-059402ecfd03', 'ecc85d26-54dd-4b54-852c-c4e7234abf9e', 'ed7b7148-e57e-4a85-87fe-07bba5251ff1']",Scheduling the South American Qualifiers to the 2018 FIFA World Cup by integer programming,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
907,"This paper proposes a sentence selection technique for constructing phonetically and prosodically balanced compact recording scripts for speech synthesis. In the conventional corpus design of speech synthesis, a greedy algorithm that maximizes phonetic coverage is often used. However, for statistical parametric speech synthesis, balances of multiple phonetic and prosodic contextual factors are important as well as the coverage. To take account of both of the phonetic and prosodic contextual balances in sentence selection, we introduce an extended entropy of phonetic and prosodic contexts, such as biphone/triphone, accent/stress/tone, and sentence length. For detailed investigation, conventional and proposed techniques are evaluated using Japanese, English, and Chinese corpora. The objective experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves better coverage and balance of contexts. In addition, speech synthesis experiments based on hidden Markov models reveal that the generated speech parameters become closer to those of the natural speech compared with other conventional sentence selection techniques. Subjective evaluations show that the proposed sentence selection based on the extended entropy improves the naturalness of the synthetic speech while maintaining the similarity to the original sample.","['Takashi Nose', 'Yusuke Arao', 'Takao Kobayashi', 'Komei Sugiura', 'Yoshinori Shiga']",01bd3579-18ae-45f2-a56e-13e463c13000,0,"['0319754a-1db4-4ea5-bc4e-c4f5771bfe13', '03718fad-59b3-4560-bc6d-029ab24bdb9a', '07e06b6c-3567-411c-9beb-ffdddf7c5954', '0f2fdd9c-39c7-48c9-8387-db9e8e3ecef6', '1568252d-5a3c-4b3f-9be8-e42cfe5a5f85', '25628871-10dc-4471-b9dc-f48487ad87b2', '26557fc7-2272-4d59-bb41-bd3868fc94a0', '2b8d0d66-555c-4907-ac58-5140c941e57f', '30eec26f-872c-45ff-b4c2-7df9b3a124dc', '34579f02-ba45-402f-ad2d-cfdf75083cd4', '34607723-82f2-43ad-be51-4a29a43393d1', '37b45f5a-af53-450e-8bc7-aecefa978105', '3c360e72-cec5-48a9-94d1-4c0dbc710f70', '47c07a29-bb0d-477d-bb1a-146ab8862a49', '4d065162-b3eb-488e-870a-654f1c6d1195', '5ad5ecd7-6e23-4230-9833-747c9a2f0e17', '650850a2-37ea-4957-aaa0-ff8a7b72c0ee', '686ee2bc-3ce8-43ac-b6f3-349a83eef670', '770703c1-31bf-4108-a958-ac3addb5a4e0', '77dc3769-626b-4ec3-a6d8-b708eba979d0', '7ab234ef-3b91-4144-ad1d-509747b57d62', '8f8e26ed-286c-405c-8ed0-aabfb064cdc1', '98d9d82c-51bb-4d39-b7a2-582fef814e98', '9aa9f870-2611-4daa-beee-fa2a43a5608d', 'b42efab2-d9a0-40d1-ae81-3b7933020dc7', 'b7c861e0-9108-4bc2-aef6-8c41bf80f62b', 'be88b538-9baa-46ab-a01f-a6f2dfb9932b', 'dd3e4f83-4f85-419a-b4fd-397788db4124', 'de724461-98fa-4e11-8fde-37d05cd8b41b', 'ea727d9c-3688-4ff0-b9bc-20e322272861', 'eb81901f-4468-40d2-8dc9-23bf4988b042', 'edb85e48-0351-4119-b1d0-4f790f0c7e71', 'ef915607-593f-4567-ab53-f297fef9b168', 'efb8af49-6020-434f-8bff-01943344b125', 'f036da68-5aff-4781-baa4-b8287d4f5065', 'fb4dac48-381f-4799-ad32-0924f330421f']",Sentence Selection Based on Extended Entropy Using Phonetic and Prosodic Contexts for Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",2017

909,"The main difficulty in simulating diffusion processes at a molecular level in cell microdomains is due to the multiple scales involving nano- to micrometers. Few to many particles have to be simulated and simultaneously tracked while there are exploring a large portion of the space for binding small targets, such as buffers or active sites. Bridging the small and large spatial scales is achieved by rare events representing Brownian particles finding small targets and characterized by long-time distribution. These rare events are the bottleneck of numerical simulations. A naive stochastic simulation requires running many Brownian particles together, which is computationally greedy and inefficient. Solving the associated partial differential equations is also difficult due to the time dependent boundary conditions, narrow passages and mixed boundary conditions at small windows. We present here two reduced modeling approaches for a fast computation of diffusing fluxes in microdomains. The first approach is based on a Markov mass-action law equations coupled to a Markov chain. The second is a Gillespie's method based on the narrow escape theory for coarse-graining the geometry of the domain into Poissonian rates. The main application concerns diffusion in cellular biology, where we compute as an example the distribution of arrival times of calcium ions to small hidden targets to trigger vesicular release.","['Claire Guerrier', 'David Holcman']",01b35de3-e8eb-4847-af55-2d4561570daa,0,"['282ad0f4-a197-4498-8616-3a7f78d7c678', '5100c6f2-bea7-4e45-b79f-f017eb02feed', '65951a54-1c6d-4157-be72-c70f907150dd', '82e9955b-acb5-4e7d-832b-9cdb6d101743', 'a503ec6b-3871-4e28-ba9c-7ebd9183fd59', 'c8d87951-968b-493f-a22f-432b4c8fba85', 'd7e3ec61-8ce4-4493-8295-a15142f3b26f', 'e617bc67-7412-4ef2-98fe-08f54ca276e0', 'f7bbd5ab-e6d7-4d5b-b09c-fa8b452966ad']",Multiscale models and stochastic simulation methods for computing rare but key binding events in cell biology,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
910,"We consider the approximation of the phase-space flow of a dynamical system on a triangulated surface using an approach known as Discrete Flow Mapping. Such flows are of interest throughout statistical mechanics, but the focus here is on flows arising from ray tracing approximations of linear wave equations. An orthogonal polynomial basis approximation of the phase-space density is applied in both the position and direction coordinates, in contrast with previous studies where piecewise constant functions have typically been applied for the spatial approximation. In order to improve the tractability of an orthogonal polynomial approximation in both phase-space coordinates, we propose a careful strategy for computing the propagation operator. For the favourable case of a Legendre polynomial basis we show that the integrals in the definition of the propagation operator may be evaluated analytically with respect to position and via a spectrally convergent quadrature rule for the direction coordinate. A generally applicable spectral quadrature scheme for integration with respect to both coordinates is also detailed for completeness. Finally, we provide numerical results that motivate the use of p-refinement in the orthogonal polynomial basis.","['Janis Bajars', 'David J.

911,"In order to analyze system function structure, the system function structure analysis theory is put forward based on factor space theory. Factors space is more suitable for describing cognition process of intelligence science than the qualitative cartesian space. Based on factor logic, the justice system of the function structure analysis was built. It is proved that the system function logic structure is a minimal disjunctive normal form from the system function analysis. The relationship is discussed between the classification reasoning method of inward analysis of system structure in space fault tree (SFT) and the function structure analysis. The process of inward analysis of system function structure in SFT is realized by the function structure analysis theory. The original classification reasoning method is enhanced to the level of logic mathematics. The system function structures of both incomplete information and complete information are analyzed with the method respectively, and the minimal disjunctive normal forms obtained from the analyses are \(T = x_{1},x_{4}, + x_{3},x_{5}, + x _{1},x_{2},\) and \(T = x_{1},x_{4}, + x_{3},x_{5}, +x_{1},x_{2}, x_{3},\). The findings indicate that there are some implicit relationships between \(A_{3},\) and \(A_{2},\) , \(A_{1},\).

912,"The product review plays an important role in customer’s purchase decision making process on the e-commerce websites. Emotions can significantly influence the way that reviews are processed. The importance of discrete emotions embedded in online reviews and their impact on review helpfulness is not explored intensively in prior studies. This study builds a helpfulness predictive model using deep neural network and investigates the influences of emotions that contribute to review helpfulness. We present an approach that extract novel discrete positive and negative emotion features from textual content of product reviews using NRC emotion Lexicon. In addition, the type of product, reviewer, visibility, readability, linguistics and sentiment related characteristics are also used for comparison and helpfulness prediction. The experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate that positive emotion features are the best predictors when individual category of feature is considered. However, negative emotion features and visibility features have comparable performance. Furthermore, the hybrid set of features with positive emotion features produce the best predictive performance for helpfulness of online reviews. The empirical evaluation finds that Trust, Joy and Anticipation (positive emotions); Anxiety and Sadness (negative emotions) are most influential emotion dimensions and have greater impact on perceived helpfulness. The findings of this study highlight the importance of emotions in online reviews and have significant implications for consumer and e-commerce retailers.","['M.S.I.

913,"Some applications, especially those clinical applications requiring high accuracy of sequencing data, usually have to face the troubles caused by unavoidable sequencing errors. Several tools have been proposed to profile the sequencing quality, but few of them can quantify or correct the sequencing errors. This unmet requirement motivated us to develop AfterQC, a tool with functions to profile sequencing errors and correct most of them, plus highly automated quality control and data filtering features. Different from most tools, AfterQC analyses the overlapping of paired sequences for pair-end sequencing data. Based on overlapping analysis, AfterQC can detect and cut adapters, and furthermore it gives a novel function to correct wrong bases in the overlapping regions. Another new feature is to detect and visualise sequencing bubbles, which can be commonly found on the flowcell lanes and may raise sequencing errors. Besides normal per cycle quality and base content plotting, AfterQC also provides features like polyX (a long sub-sequence of a same base X) filtering, automatic trimming and K-MER based strand bias profiling. For each single or pair of FastQ files, AfterQC filters out bad reads, detects and eliminates sequencer’s bubble effects, trims reads at front and tail, detects the sequencing errors and corrects part of them, and finally outputs clean data and generates HTML reports with interactive figures. AfterQC can run in batch mode with multiprocess support, it can run with a single FastQ file, a single pair of FastQ files (for pair-end sequencing), or a folder for all included FastQ files to be processed automatically. Based on overlapping analysis, AfterQC can estimate the sequencing error rate and profile the error transform distribution. The results of our error profiling tests show that the error distribution is highly platform dependent. Much more than just another new quality control (QC) tool, AfterQC is able to perform quality control, data filtering, error profiling and base correction automatically. Experimental results show that AfterQC can help to eliminate the sequencing errors for pair-end sequencing data to provide much cleaner outputs, and consequently help to reduce the false-positive variants, especially for the low-frequency somatic mutations. While providing rich configurable options, AfterQC can detect and set all the options automatically and require no argument in most cases.","['Shifu Chen', 'Tanxiao Huang', 'Yanqing Zhou', 'Yue Han', 'Mingyan Xu', 'Jia Gu']",406837ec-0fe8-4ee5-87a5-ac8a01a68b7a,0,"['0564647c-e7f4-412d-9000-19745809b6d7', '1a353dac-b799-47eb-9c47-da43de7c6f07', '2725e789-b16f-4a36-aee5-735e6bf63916', '2a34526d-2c49-4373-83d0-4e3d2d7786cf', '556639e9-f0e8-4459-b22e-39c987a8208e', '77152346-2e39-482b-91c7-43d0e3fc43e2']","AfterQC: automatic filtering, trimming, error removing and quality control for fastq data",BMC Bioinformatics,2017
914,"As real industrial processes have measurement samples with noises of different statistical characteristics and obtain the sample one by one usually, on-line sequential learning algorithms which can achieve better learning performance for systems with noises of various statistics are necessary. This paper proposes a new online Extreme Learning Machine (ELM, of Huang et al.) algorithm, namely recursive least mean   p     p       -power ELM (RLMP-ELM). In RLMP-ELM, a novel error criterion for cost function, namely the least mean   p     p       -power (LMP) error criterion, provides a mechanism to update the output weights sequentially. The LMP error criterion aims to minimize the mean   p     p       -power of the error that is the generalization of the mean square error criterion used in the ELM. The proposed on-line learning algorithm is able to provide on-line predictions of variables with noises of different statistics and obtains better performance than ELM and online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) while the non-Gaussian noises impact the processes.

916,"Factor graphs provide a flexible and general framework for specifying probability distributions. They can capture a range of popular and recent models for analysis of both genomics data as well as data from other scientific fields. Owing to the ever larger data sets encountered in genomics and the multiple-testing issues accompanying them, accurate significance evaluation is of great importance. We here address the problem of evaluating statistical significance of observations from factor graph models. Two novel numerical approximations for evaluation of statistical significance are presented. First a method using importance sampling. Second a saddlepoint approximation based method. We develop algorithms to efficiently compute the approximations and compare them to naive sampling and the normal approximation. The individual merits of the methods are analysed both from a theoretical viewpoint and with simulations. A guideline for choosing between the normal approximation, saddle-point approximation and importance sampling is also provided. Finally, the applicability of the methods is demonstrated with examples from cancer genomics, motif-analysis and phylogenetics. The applicability of saddlepoint approximation and importance sampling is demonstrated on known models in the factor graph framework. Using the two methods we can substantially improve computational cost without compromising accuracy.

918,"Opportunistic Routing  (OR) protocols are designed to address the reliability of traditional routing protocols in wireless networks. The main concept behind OR protocols is to select a set of candidates (instead of a single) in each step of the routing process to collaboratively route data packets towards their destination. However, choosing a higher number of next-hop nodes increases the probability of selecting malicious candidates in hostile environments. In this paper, we propose a packet salvaging model, which empowers OR protocols to defend against malicious nodes by saving a proportion of dropped or manipulated packets. The proposed approach is modeled using Discrete-Time-Markov-Chain (DTMC), and is applicable in wireless mesh networks. Furthermore, in addition to the proposal of a novel method of calculating various network parameters, including packet delivery ratio, drop ratio, expected number of transmissions, and hop count specific to this model, two new network parameters are introduced known as salvage ratio and direct-delivery ratio. Finally, a comprehensive set of performance evaluations is conducted, using both analytical methods and network simulation.

920,"Recent research proposals on DRAM caches with conventional allocation units (64 or 128 bytes) as well as large allocation units (512 bytes to 4KB) have explored ways to minimize the space/latency impact of the tag store and maximize the effective utilization of the bandwidth. In this article, we study sectored DRAM caches that exercise large allocation units called sectors, invest reasonably small storage to maintain tag/state, enable space- and bandwidth-efficient tag/state caching due to low tag working set size and large data coverage per tag element, and minimize main memory bandwidth wastage by fetching only the useful portions of an allocated sector. However, the sectored caches suffer from poor space utilization, since a large sector is always allocated even if the sector utilization is low. The recently proposed Unison cache addresses only a special case of this problem by not allocating the sectors that have only one active block.   We propose Micro-sector cache, a locality-aware sectored DRAM cache architecture that features a flexible mechanism to allocate cache blocks within a sector and a locality-aware sector replacement algorithm. Simulation studies on a set of 30 16-way multi-programmed workloads show that our proposal, when incorporated in an optimized Unison cache baseline, improves performance (weighted speedup) by 8%, 14%, and 16% on average, respectively, for 1KB, 2KB, and 4KB sectors at 128MB capacity. These performance improvements result from significantly better cache space utilization, leading to 18%, 21%, and 22% average reduction in DRAM cache read misses, respectively, for 1KB, 2KB, and 4KB sectors at 128MB capacity. We evaluate our proposal for DRAM cache capacities ranging from 128MB to 1GB.","['Mainak Chaudhuri', 'Mukesh Agrawal', 'Jayesh Gaur', 'Sreenivas Subramoney']",3ed3cd26-6419-4042-bb23-ace55807ff67,0,"['07ddf07a-cbed-46fe-bdbd-1629d1ee1f57', '0ca0263a-3a17-4277-b19f-19f052249c5a', '14b3aa50-c54e-4755-b747-d9ee37239609', '1978f52d-d149-46da-888d-b5e2f9fc904c', '1b3653dc-e810-49c8-8854-ac74f8edb8bb', '1b453c91-4294-419b-9719-c49c6932b253', '1ff818e7-560c-4b62-a455-9275142fdb6c', '284ad680-b4c9-4925-96c6-28e7e6a3be2e', '2ff186de-42a4-4985-a4ff-4fa2263e8c5c', '3c852e46-bf94-405c-8221-e14fedd7cadf', '3da00ced-06e5-41a4-87cb-308c9eee5bfe', '51b86f9b-78e2-49cc-b381-370e74efd9de', '543a7ee5-c3af-4e2a-8506-a544ce8f2f72', '67a8ba42-199b-4453-84aa-2b116b0b2b67', '8bf7a600-92cf-45a0-a3ec-90974dd3d5cd', '8d4d56a1-cdba-43fb-9e13-0b2a6bd96c7e', '9276b6dd-7b52-4523-a4de-26a4852b82fc', '93c79278-0c11-4248-9dfd-36ffaa4053f1', 'a1ef1f7e-871c-4df7-9909-90cf2f017843', 'b1937e8b-f026-4f0c-aa9a-a39d92920c79', 'b89f75c4-b552-4190-a5d7-21a1aa533fbe', 'bea7c208-c287-486a-98f9-3f70f9f93770', 'bf5f15b8-51ca-4970-94bc-8a89c6370db7', 'c0dc209a-e5b8-4044-9678-c6e4cd20f865', 'c11ea1c5-ab9a-406f-bce1-02b46ee2a706', 'd60f7d90-6d6d-4890-81c3-8e03c05c0bcd', 'd662ea9c-0e34-470f-b329-23203ba5f3a4', 'dfc040ab-6b72-4a89-85a3-33ff357707a4', 'e792118e-8bfb-463e-9161-15dedb2a5b57', 'f7df19be-3d73-48c0-b4a8-bfd410ec9bf8', 'fb18ed16-d98e-41a1-afaa-d0e5a665e8d0']",Micro-Sector Cache: Improving Space Utilization in Sectored DRAM Caches,ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization,2017
921,"Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely used technique to guide the users of web applications towards items that might interest them. CF approaches are severely challenged by the characteristics of user-item preference matrices, which are often high dimensional and extremely sparse. Recently, several works have shown that incorporating information from social networks—such as friendship and trust relationships—into traditional CF alleviates the sparsity related issues and yields a better recommendation quality, in most cases. More interestingly, even with comparable performances, social-based CF is more beneficial than traditional CF; the former makes it possible to provide recommendations for cold start users. In this paper, we propose a novel model that leverages information from social networks to improve recommendations. While existing social CF models are based on popular modelling assumptions such as Gaussian or Multinomial, our model builds on the von Mises–Fisher assumption which turns out to be more adequate, than the aforementioned assumptions, for high dimensional sparse data. Setting the estimate of the model parameters under the maximum likelihood approach, we derive a scalable learning algorithm for analyzing data with our model. Empirical results on several real-world datasets provide strong support for the advantages of the proposed model.","['Aghiles Salah', 'Mohamed Nadif']",0f709380-e9a7-4637-b5e8-2ea38d6e64c5,0,"['091b5cc0-5e77-48ef-82a6-1ffb23f84f6a', '1d0a0a4e-2992-4f52-9086-93b0b717fb56', '2802fa49-8290-4797-80cd-e3925afad083', '3be2ed7e-9c26-45f9-82aa-5ce8bdaae4c0', '4b5d438c-2c59-4684-80cc-b084cf4beecd', '4d19a303-4bd4-4bc2-9a81-5d7d2d214c41', '504ae192-4804-4eeb-8699-ca13eb504477', '50e0fcf4-57d9-4ed6-ad7d-c9eb2bad8e42', '5297b0f8-05e9-4c45-b68d-eefbc821412d', '5898dbbb-8d4b-4077-96f4-34cd4d777f2e', '62343d7e-9698-4f99-9d2d-64fe528e5ee8', '6d364345-d2d5-4173-a547-b13209b3e890', '785fcd2f-ab8f-4265-ae49-b51086e0fc8d', '85847434-179b-4bbf-a19a-ee90b05ba42c', '8b04d095-b24f-495a-a706-6356f19d6176', '8cc33cb6-d236-42d3-bd28-4ecbe53a0485', '94b095a5-74ad-47ec-a39d-8dc877b2ef1e', '98b23182-8f51-428a-a4af-a91d280471ca', '9b4e6c65-da64-4ffe-8f2b-810d7f1efb54', '9e9bfa51-6c02-461b-8da6-539a040e4db4', 'a3322191-42ee-4c40-bfe0-9a86aa2e3828', 'a4e895a1-9e7f-4ced-a183-299ce40869f7', 'a652fa93-21c8-468f-bedf-08a73cbf281e', 'a7fd7113-0da0-476c-9774-410d5f44b896', 'afaee3cb-390a-4b89-9dbf-c053399f906a', 'b72042d2-4458-4e9f-916e-a589d597129c', 'b88af369-cc19-446a-b944-7a9955ec6f0e', 'cb4fc0ec-b323-415e-ae4a-eadb810508a3', 'd253f9b7-3090-4b71-beca-b67b3c2f8827', 'd3ec5b39-7147-440d-82b0-4c4d05e671c9', 'd56bd2b3-7d87-4489-986f-16e7669d676d', 'd8de70c8-9335-4f44-9058-a002b0bd0a0e', 'd973efe5-f815-4dd5-b642-19fe3d789792', 'f1ed15c6-a193-45d0-8313-d63d3049ba6b', 'fb697d1e-0314-4f36-bbbb-1d5d8f610dca']",Social regularized von Mises–Fisher mixture model for item recommendation,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2017

923,"Manifold-based semi-supervised classifiers have attracted increasing interest in recent years. However, they suffer from over learning of locality and cannot be applied to the point cloud sampled from a stratified space. This problem is resolved in this paper by using the fact that the smoothness assumption must be satisfied with the interior points of the manifolds and may be violated in the non-interior points. Distinction of interior and non-interior points is based on the behavior of graph Laplacian in the   ϵ     ϵ       -neighborhood of the intersection points. First, this property was generalized to   K  NN graph representing the stratified space and then a new algorithm was proposed that penalizes the smoothness on the non-interior points of the manifolds by modifying the edge weights of the graph. Compared to some recent multi-manifold semi-supervised classifiers, the proposed method does not require neither knowing the dimensions of the manifolds nor large amount of unlabeled points to estimate the underling manifolds and does not assume similar properties for neighbors of all data points. Some experiments have been conducted in order to show that it improves the classification accuracy on a number of artificial and real benchmark data sets.","['Zohre Karimi', 'Saeed Shiry Ghidary']",d6a49b41-9932-4d3a-b21a-3775e6cdb406,0,"['05bbaec3-7980-4941-8638-2bbfa4ac8be0', '05e70e8b-bc92-48b5-bf90-26c86ce5b790', '0a345988-8fcb-4ac1-b13b-4f0e4cc941e7', '1680b7fc-f05b-4ad5-82ab-1ae657845b74', '1d0a0a4e-2992-4f52-9086-93b0b717fb56', '23e2e353-0061-436d-932b-8f20e07113c6', '3562a6d2-c5f7-4292-b268-bf68e9c30031', '3b8c702c-4e54-4b06-842b-d38ce8161130', '4b82f928-30db-4c75-86b1-7f43c0bb986e', '4d05f2cc-528e-46df-852d-c16d7edc48f7', '4dd3f4c4-d7c3-4028-bd1e-599ce8c52997', '60673126-80b6-46f5-a0cb-140b687f77aa', '6466b241-a39b-4bbc-871e-02b46cd0130b', '695c6840-3f8d-4de8-a50c-99d03fd7ba26', '7017cc5e-b12f-4f18-9667-09ee5276243a', '75bef343-9ac6-43e2-9ae8-3a9a9f081d67', '7aa7ecf9-444f-4b3c-8cd8-dcad6fb9ebaf', '8121e1ab-01c2-4632-821f-c09b0dbf7143', '8bc16cb5-9ee8-4696-91e2-b2177dbc3a1b', '8d1f8952-ec48-46a9-aee7-edc89036e2ce', '8fa0d827-01d1-40d9-a812-f3e028c79085', '93a14c23-d227-41fd-ad18-7de38817cb52', 'a5794e93-4193-451a-ba56-ed199920dc8c', 'a5e3c7d4-bdc9-46e9-9ebd-044328488842', 'af022893-de71-4566-b2a8-b49fc1d40940', 'b0c6a3ee-7e15-4164-8f90-ad8f081a28c6', 'b5653323-fd2d-4485-8aea-c3a69a9983fa', 'c472bfe1-9ef6-43c6-89b5-a86b22c9f5df', 'c5a11af1-872d-4ab7-b191-73265beda215', 'db9086b9-517c-4d6f-aa94-ec199b27ce65', 'f1c52d54-f30a-4469-8a8f-d36e515af1f8', 'f26532d1-edeb-40d5-bc5f-0aea8dbcd7df']",Semi-supervised classification in stratified spaces by considering non-interior points using Laplacian behavior,Neurocomputing,2017
924,"Computer networks are critical to many tasks in our daily lives. Therefore, mechanisms that guarantee the resilience of the network must be provided. Different approaches have been proposed to address potential challenges to network operation, but they rely on rigid solutions, which work only in anticipated scenarios. To address this issue, this paper presents BDI2DoS, which is a multi-agent innovative application that ensures the resilience of networks against the widely known Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. We take an existing network resilience strategy based on event–condition–action (ECA) policies to combat DDoS attacks, and use it as a requirement to specify the behaviour that must emerge from the interaction among agents, which together are capable of detecting and remediating anomalies that are considered a DDoS threat, in a flexible way. Agents in our multi-agent system follow the widely used BDI architecture, and were implemented with the BDI4JADE agent platform. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of BDI2DoS, we used the PReSET resilience simulator and BDI4JADE to build an integrated testbed. Our experiments compare the effectiveness of the ECA and the BDI-based resilience strategies and show that the latter is more flexible and able to cope with problems that occur during the execution of the anticipated behaviour.","['Ingrid Nunes', 'Frederico Schardong', 'Alberto Schaeffer-Filho']",d632c0c9-87f3-4255-b263-dbfa89ca6761,0,"['01b8f278-ea15-4fe1-a338-9261d7798e73', '01c38a82-f027-41bc-b900-1d3c61fd7e02', '02a30d20-6a14-47b0-bf0f-c7d836bd4423', '155308cd-8b91-4de7-90e3-0effc4c557d8', '18605e1b-1fe1-4f08-bd63-9fb357f2e043', '2222f23e-ac75-4f8a-8f3b-3f3b6c5e39e1', '247b0762-afa8-4238-b608-fd5320f0f256', '2c844dd5-5273-475a-bddd-bfcba36c6022', '476af27a-91b4-4881-b2ed-acd0ec21aeef', '4f93c731-1c76-4a32-bbd8-c97001c57118', '7565eb7f-f8ff-4cbe-9a11-3556366298ec', '80385bf8-2c0e-4f71-a315-048b20d4027a', '9db41d5a-592d-4dea-95a4-a27be2c29c85', 'abd90ceb-db66-4c29-b063-18fced881f05', 'b15d2cb4-b14d-405e-9faa-2dca0c307fd5', 'b56e0075-1df5-4a75-8c05-cea31f13e97d', 'c5bc21e6-af4a-4e6f-81bf-70a9850c3a17', 'cc4901a9-e2c0-4cf7-939b-077ac1f4184b', 'd164c51b-45a2-47e6-bbd1-7b28d0940cf3', 'd7f66810-9e76-4c05-97ba-07c8a0416433', 'e3cd664c-9f9e-41d3-b063-b143ea92f843', 'f497994e-69af-40f6-8145-47f1b365f7aa']",BDI2DoS: An application using collaborating BDI agents to combat DDoS attacks,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017
925,"Given the limitations of traditional classification methods based on port number and payload inspection, a large number of studies have focused on developing classification approaches that use Transport Layer Statistics (TLS) features and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. However, classifying Internet traffic data using these approaches is still a difficult task because (1) TLS features are not very robust for traffic classification because they cannot capture the complex non-linear characteristics of Internet traffic, and (2) the existing Feature Selection (FS) techniques cannot reliably provide optimal and stable features for ML algorithms. With the aim of addressing these problems, this paper presents a novel feature extraction and selection approach. First, multifractal features are extracted from traffic flows using a Wavelet Leaders Multifractal Formalism(WLMF) to depict the traffic flows; next, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based FS method is applied on these multifractal features to remove the irrelevant and redundant features. Based on real traffic traces, the experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in accuracy of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) comparing to the TLS features studied in existing ML-based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is suitable for real time traffic classification because of the ability of classifying traffic at the early stage of traffic transmission.","['Hongtao Shi', 'Hongping Li', 'Dan Zhang', 'Chaqiu Cheng', 'Wei Wu']",ec22dc3b-d0de-49ba-a2e9-ed20f3ca2b5a,0,"['01c38a82-f027-41bc-b900-1d3c61fd7e02', '03337129-6067-45a4-a948-e2acb49cebbd', '03753489-9dfc-4daf-aa70-af0bf41a4c17', '12cc958e-e8a5-46d2-b802-2d3e14d90611', '177468c5-f2fb-492b-831d-7cf1a54f5888', '1f0cb779-c4f3-47fb-ae07-9c16e50240e9', '29cb556f-5438-4153-8a0c-e2bbaaed501d', '330a77e7-cd93-4dec-8fc5-14625b7cb395', '3649257d-728a-404b-9b18-889ef6b19ac0', '36884737-6fda-49f7-bbd7-5c5238e9e748', '4454b413-4ed5-4ba5-839f-3f9017c15186', '4fb87930-7f6c-4f03-ae22-32445138ec83', '52f3014d-abc8-438b-8d70-5d48fa10ce93', '58e33263-8266-4b31-935f-dc0121a0e48d', '5c62ace1-7b17-4a08-b944-f9757065f3bc', '5d4adac4-42cd-49fc-abb7-6b8676c16359', '5e321f7f-540a-4644-8849-32569c209d61', '6b3beb65-b8a3-4772-a5c3-bb9e144803ed', '6f666d23-1733-4bbe-93bf-2715174f717b', '739981e9-e2cb-4a49-8dda-429a167bc0d2', '7c5cdb4f-bccb-44d1-9001-fcea52d6e059', '7e6db1e0-23ce-4b0f-a4a9-66f71be8b73b', '92223705-1928-4e54-9769-68041fe77123', '92c78240-e63e-497c-ba31-483ba4aa3a3f', '957d5e33-d32b-42a7-8cee-546c639ddc3a', '97df247f-ef2b-43a6-a9fc-40d487fb7341', '9f4bc807-fbe0-4bb6-8115-5953430c8ec7', 'a1e54d11-04ea-4eb5-932b-eb0e3cf1da62', 'a7171016-fcd2-4478-8c65-0ee986754e7e', 'b19ac48a-fe8c-4379-9bf8-820bc294da2f', 'b32a8358-b224-4e34-9e03-99d069b1ea07', 'baeff807-40fb-4ca6-9900-8de5aaa0971a', 'bb2fecf5-ccb4-4290-ad99-daf67c9d6923', 'c87f8eba-8226-46b8-8e28-f21044936c6c', 'caba626a-2dda-4c76-9e09-35ace3c0e292', 'd46737c6-4d01-464a-ae5c-3063d0ecf881', 'd9e8f19d-83b9-4a6e-86c1-083fee101376', 'e6136075-8517-4da1-b217-de3b5672ebee', 'f006e236-59ad-4647-a59f-4f46dc2c85be', 'f42e671e-7a91-499d-a7ba-05a9c276f622', 'fa06fbcc-581c-4fdb-ba44-7ef19d7972fd', 'fdc75ca1-cb67-4380-9b68-2f05cb8e1725', 'feff8862-f47d-4591-a7cb-b62d7efc81a2']",Efficient and robust feature extraction and selection for traffic classification,Computer Networks,2017
926,"Protein carbonylation, an irreversible and non-enzymatic post-translational modification (PTM), is often used as a marker of oxidative stress. When reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidized the amino acid side chains, carbonyl (CO) groups are produced especially on Lysine (K), Arginine (R), Threonine (T), and Proline (P). Nevertheless, due to the lack of information about the carbonylated substrate specificity, we were encouraged to develop a systematic method for a comprehensive investigation of protein carbonylation sites. After the removal of redundant data from multipe carbonylation-related articles, totally 226 carbonylated proteins in human are regarded as training dataset, which consisted of 307, 126, 128, and 129 carbonylation sites for K, R, T and P residues, respectively. To identify the useful features in predicting carbonylation sites, the linear amino acid sequence was adopted not only to build up the predictive model from training dataset, but also to compare the effectiveness of prediction with other types of features including amino acid composition (AAC), amino acid pair composition (AAPC), position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), positional weighted matrix (PWM), solvent-accessible surface area (ASA), and physicochemical properties. The investigation of position-specific amino acid composition revealed that the positively charged amino acids (K and R) are remarkably enriched surrounding the carbonylated sites, which may play a functional role in discriminating between carbonylation and non-carbonylation sites. A variety of predictive models were built using various features and three different machine learning methods. Based on the evaluation by five-fold cross-validation, the models trained with PWM feature could provide better sensitivity in the positive training dataset, while the models trained with AAindex feature achieved higher specificity in the negative training dataset. Additionally, the model trained using hybrid features, including PWM, AAC and AAindex, obtained best MCC values of 0.432, 0.472, 0.443 and 0.467 on K, R, T and P residues, respectively. When comparing to an existing prediction tool, the selected models trained with hybrid features provided a promising accuracy on an independent testing dataset. In short, this work not only characterized the carbonylated substrate preference, but also demonstrated that the proposed method could provide a feasible means for accelerating preliminary discovery of protein carbonylation.","['Shun Long Weng', 'Kai Yao Huang', 'Fergie Joanda Kaunang', 'Chien Hsun Huang', 'Hui Ju Kao', 'Tzu Hao Chang', 'Hsin Yao Wang', 'Jang Jih Lu', 'Tzong Yi Lee']",f077790d-0d26-49c3-8788-5cc8ec7857f9,0,"['08c65156-9ec8-4426-9e28-bfededa229cf', '094c7df1-7d25-4019-8a8b-4a6bff9ff9c1', '0cb6d878-f8e3-4090-b007-5e20e22dd30e', '30101757-162f-4cd3-9695-6a21888e54bb', '48bc4e65-97ef-4cef-b341-ac9f510ef87a', '4ca0e408-e4b9-4b2e-be89-f018c74298b5', '4cf6c7f0-1167-484c-8a89-e73cc552ff74', '73c3acae-a729-4ff1-a8bb-4cd4ee285061', '809db52c-4c25-4c2a-ab9f-483072868ff1', '8669d26c-bc2a-491e-adce-bf5dde8727bf', '95bba0e7-d4db-4264-9160-0ced58be9d7e', '970e5de3-e56c-42e8-a1c8-d1e18c4360cc', '9a48d999-f638-48f7-8e39-3f231302e12b', '9abf980d-ace1-4858-b62b-573d26defc18', '9c7d2eb0-449e-4969-9b24-424aca8d42a0', 'b33eea94-414c-4232-a1b8-1ffc687c1d61', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'c91c625c-2738-4e44-ae73-0e5f3b0ec559', 'cad27302-01d3-42c8-9623-166f6961d31e', 'cd592ef0-f4ee-4b97-9b78-cb89b96af4fd', 'd8b8c245-d108-4019-96aa-9c48ca6eea2f', 'f52657cf-f90b-4b9f-a0f6-c61b62398783', 'f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6', 'faa9acbb-e633-4c72-a239-1c988afcf9f7']",Investigation and identification of protein carbonylation sites based on position-specific amino acid composition and physicochemical features,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
927,"Previous research has suggested that access and exposure to computing, social supports, preparatory privilege, a sense of belonging in computing, and a computing identity all contribute to women pursuing computing as a field of study or intended career. What we know less about is what keeps young women persisting in computing despite the obstacles they encounter. This article describes findings from analysis of 64 in-depth interviews with young women who in high school expressed interest in computing by looking into National Center for Women and IT's Aspirations in Computing Award. The dataset includes award winners and nonwinners, some of whom have persisted in computing and some who have not. The authors' findings suggest that multiple, redundant supports, including community reinforcement, as well as a bolstered sense of identity/belonging, may make the difference in who persists and who does not.","['Wendy M.

928,"A real-world customer segmentation problem from a beverage distribution firm is addressed. The firm wants to partition a set of customers, who share geographical and marketing attributes, into segments according to certain requirements: (a) customers allocated to the same segment must have very similar attributes: type of contract, type of store and the average difference of purchase volume; and (b) compact segments are desired. The main reason for creating a partition with these features is because the firm wants to try different product marketing strategies. In this paper, a detailed attribute formulation and an iterated greedy heuristic that iteratively destroys and reconstructs a given partition are proposed. The initial partition is obtained by using a modified k-means algorithm that involves a GRASP philosophy to get the initial configuration of centers. The heuristic includes an improvement method that employs two local search procedures. Computational results and statistical analyses show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its individual components. The proposed metaheuristic is also observed very competitive, faster, and more robust when compared to existing methods.","['Diana L. Huerta-Muñoz', 'Roger Z.

930,"In home video supply chains, movie makers as content producers create the most value in the movie industry but they are unable to publish and distribute their videos in an efficient while effective manner. Therefore, they usually sell their videos’ licenses to home video enterprises (HVEs) that have expertise in advertising and distributing the procured videos to the market. This paper proposes a novel integrated model for content procurement and distribution planning within the context of home video supply chains. The developed model helps HVEs to determine buying which available videos are more profitable and how to distribute them in terms of distribution timing and quantities. It also determines videos’ license prices, which is certainly one of the most important concerns of HVEs in this context. According to deep uncertainty in videos’ demands, fluctuation in audiences’ expectations and diverse qualities in the content of procured videos, the critical parameters are tainted with epistemic uncertainty and therefore are formulated though possibility distributions in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers. An efficient possibilistic programming approach is tailored to convert the original possibilistic model into the crisp counterpart. Applicability of the proposed model is validated through an illustrative example from which useful managerial insights are also provided.","['Z. Asadollahi Sohi', 'S. A.

The SMAF-IF is an integrated system with different types of sensors and numerical models and incorporates the Geographic Information System (GIS) and web techniques, which focuses on coastal seiche events detection and early warning in the North Jiangsu shoal, China. The in situ sensors perform automatic and continuous monitoring of the marine environment status and the numerical models provide the meteorological and physical oceanographic parameter estimates. A model outputs processing software was developed in C# language using ArcGIS Engine functions, which provides the capabilities of automatically generating visualization maps and warning information. Leveraging the ArcGIS Flex API and ASP.NET web services, a web based GIS framework was designed to facilitate quasi real-time data access, interactive visualization and analysis, and provision of early warning services for end users. The integrated framework proposed in this study enables decision-makers and the publics to quickly response to emergency coastal seiche events and allows an easy adaptation to other regional and scientific domains related to real-time monitoring and forecasting.","['Rufu Qin', 'Liangzhao Lin']",018b66fe-5d11-475a-8755-ed9312af8e21,0,"['033ab55f-7866-4c0f-b23b-09482b5482e1', '0ef7fef5-f5b0-4fa2-9e91-0f917953dafa', '0f5695df-abe5-4c15-a2bd-2c19cf371c36', '473aae5c-cac5-43e0-bbe2-f70e1f4ec9c3', '5030f43e-e2d3-45c3-a25a-9e972d3250a0', '5286a958-0282-4c54-8bac-2f39877ffe1f', '5cdd6d76-5456-45e6-99fd-0a16afd3b049', '66157eab-fee2-4238-980f-a53af6360c39', '6b2a53c6-1079-4bc3-b7eb-ff610ca43a11', '7bbc309a-f398-49be-a48b-c588fc6a4e76', '7dd9e11f-7115-4deb-9ce6-f29e8150bd59', '84edd07b-f918-47ff-ae5f-4e1e58e1c3cc', '86c03c8f-3818-4efc-8127-14da24990a8c', 'a75685cc-036f-4a61-b44a-a8828a8f9d2d', 'ba49da96-21b9-4614-8b6a-eb787107240e', 'cb7d5526-0699-4ac3-b3f2-c57f60095317', 'eab74cd1-b4b3-4266-b50d-dd8b924747ea', 'eb49f434-cbaf-4a84-b972-c412b6500745']",Development of a GIS-based integrated framework for coastal seiches monitoring and forecasting: A North Jiangsu shoal case study,Computers & Geosciences,2017
932,"Our desire to deliver increased functionality while setting tighter operational and regulative boundaries has fueled a recent influx of highly coupled systems. Nonetheless, our current capacity to successfully deliver them is still in its infancy. Understanding how such Designed systems are structured, along with how they compare to their naturally Evolved counterparts, can play an important role in bettering our capacity to do so. Based on this premise, the structural patterns underlying a wide range of seemingly unrelated systems are uncovered using tools from network science. By doing so, structural patterns emerge and are subsequently used to highlight both similarities and differences between the two classes of systems. With a focus on the Designed class, and assuming that increased structural variety fuels design uncertainty, it is shown that their adherence to statistical normality i.e., expected vs. encountered patterns and statistical correlations between combinations of such patterns is rather limited. Insight of this sort has both theoretical context agnostic approaches are increasingly relevant within the domain of Systems Engineering, yet are rarely used and practical transferability of knowledge implications.","['Christos Ellinas', 'Neil L.

933,"Spoken term detection (STD), the process of finding all occurrences of a specified search term in a large amount of speech segments, has many applications in multimedia search and retrieval of information. It is known that use of video information in the form of lip movements can improve the performance of STD in the presence of audio noise. However, research in this direction has been hampered by the unavailability of large annotated audio visual databases for development. We propose a novel approach to develop audio visual spoken term detection when only a small (low resource) audio visual database is available for development. First, cross database training is proposed as a novel framework using the fused hidden Markov modeling (HMM) technique, which is used to train an audio model using extensive large and publicly available audio databases; then it is adapted to the visual data of the given audio visual database. This approach is shown to perform better than standard HMM joint-training method and also improves the performance of spoken term detection when used in the indexing stage. In another attempt, the external audio models are first adapted to the audio data of the given audio visual database and then they are adapted to the visual data. This approach also improves both phone recognition and spoken term detection accuracy. Finally, the cross database training technique is used as HMM initialization, and an extra parameter re-estimation step is applied on the initialized models using Baum Welch technique. The proposed approaches for audio visual model training have allowed for benefiting from both large extensive out of domain audio databases that are available and the small audio visual database that is given for development to create more accurate audio-visual models.","['Shahram Kalantari', 'David Dean', 'Sridha Sridharan']",5ef4b26e-798f-4baf-bb2c-dd69572826d5,0,"['02c646cc-212c-48f9-8a78-8c857bd8e76d', '04f703aa-dce4-400a-a739-3a583d61962d', '082657f3-419b-4dda-a972-f92ae429be08', '0830ae36-7fc7-41b3-915b-894f77dc33c3', '0d4637d1-f0a0-4546-ac27-9f829597cc4f', '14ca0cd6-62b3-46fa-aaf7-5878842a72ad', '1847c0be-3a97-4490-b06d-0004fd00f7ea', '1b368036-93e7-49c8-9181-1c936ff7a061', '1cf2a630-f00b-4f60-972e-6919bbe0aed0', '1d220e46-7ec4-4b80-acb6-849186709010', '298e7e25-642a-4f6a-a107-4c98d83d87de', '2e75afd8-182c-4c0f-8bc3-fe1ffb05baa8', '300f4fd3-324c-4cef-af3f-b401b0142917', '36b9843f-2ff5-4722-999e-c0c810e22935', '382f3bd7-d257-4a70-8e7b-126b319e9cf0', '3d80210d-3e2f-436f-b0f2-70d91ab376eb', '563b8465-7fd3-466c-856a-5e47dc6818c4', '650c01d6-bb26-4082-9f12-94c202c1cab1', '7d3c5b3d-8abc-41d7-94af-38e949e79ebd', '88918569-9404-4c0f-b669-7281e184d01c', '91188cae-e1df-406b-8818-22476aa8707a', '93af75dd-d818-4ed9-aee9-67214782e6f4', '9c47abf8-46de-4b8a-b9a5-25dd75e52aff', 'a6cac818-693f-49ba-81bd-8d7d42036f90', 'b082d3b7-c11c-4c19-bf2b-57ba05ef96f2', 'c48c5633-6365-463d-a239-588c7f1b3d35', 'c73b7faa-09e3-4956-81db-fb3cf9e31609', 'c7d686b4-1810-42a0-8981-ffed229ed603', 'ce29434d-0264-464f-8402-7f6e09110cf9', 'daf066d2-7e89-498e-8c45-d8b0b6325016', 'ef9ddafe-9509-43be-8577-2984c7a258ce']",Cross database audio visual speech adaptation for phonetic spoken term detection,Computer Speech & Language,2017
934,"In the context of multiple change-points estimation, performance analysis of estimators such as the maximum likelihood is often difficult to assess since the regularity assumptions are not met. Focusing on the estimators variance, one can, however, use lower bounds on the mean square error. In this paper, we derive the so-called Weiss–Weinstein bound (WWB) that is known to be an efficient tool in signal processing to obtain a fair overview of the estimation behavior. Contrary to several works about performance analysis in the change-point literature, our study is adapted to multiple changes. First, useful formulas are given for a general estimation problem whatever the considered distribution of the data. Second, closed-form expressions are given in the cases of Gaussian observations with changes in the mean and/or the variance, and changes in the mean rate of a Poisson distribution. Furthermore, a semidefinite programming formulation of the minimization procedure is given in order to compute the tightest WWB. Specifically, it consists of finding the unique minimum volume covering the set constituted by hyperellipsoid elements that are generated using the derived candidate WWB matrices w.r.t. the so-called Loewner partial ordering. Finally, simulation results are provided to show the good behavior of the proposed bound.","['Lucien Bacharach', 'Alexandre Renaux', 'Mohammed Nabil El Korso', 'Eric Chaumette']",edb35448-f4fc-497e-8058-d4d7467a8fec,0,"['0ba2f253-7e7e-48c0-8c49-d5637918aed9', '21a89e9c-7203-4292-a8fe-8a68025142e8', '95e40e84-76d8-4549-970c-68b1f16aa908', 'b29727ac-6446-4a0d-9544-aaed3fdc4dff', 'b8c32142-34fb-4119-9d1a-f99a747eba91', 'c93738ed-fd39-406d-b078-9febc57773dc', 'db860b22-9b4d-4d12-b991-78a34857cf81', 'e9cd9533-a398-41bf-9945-48b60bba61e2', 'f90ab15b-8c3f-4662-af5e-a2fa0a37099d', 'fb86c31d-38f5-45b7-90b8-8987f0e8f52e']",Weiss–Weinstein Bound on Multiple Change-Points Estimation,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2017

Three crossover methods are employed to generate some new probability density function set of ACO\(_\mathrm{R},\). The proposed algorithms are evaluated by using 21 benchmark functions whose dimensionality is 30–1000. The simulation results show that the proposed ACO\(_\mathrm{R},\) with different crossover operators significantly enhance the performance of ACO\(_\mathrm{R},\) for global optimization. In the case the dimensionality is 1000, the proposed algorithm also can efficiently solves them.

940,"Background#R##N#The conventional hemodialysis (HD) schedule has been used for decades, even though new modalities have been introduced. Many reasons limit practices of frequent dialysis, such as patients’ environments and unknown optimal schedules for each patient. This research provides a theoretical recommendation of HD schedule through genetic algorithm (GA).#R##N#Methods#R##N#An end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with various dialysis conditions was modeled through a classic variable-volume two-compartment kinetic model to simulate an anuric patient, and GA was implemented to search for an optimal HD schedule for each individual considering and ignoring burden consumption of each dialysis session. The adequacy of the optimized HD schedules through GA was assessed with time average concentration (TAC) and time average deviation (TAD).#R##N#Results#R##N#While ignoring the burden of dialysis sessions, GA returned schedules with slightly improved values of adequacy criteria (EKRc and std Kt/V), compared to the conventional regular uniform HD schedules. The optimized HD schedules also showed decreased TAC and TAD values compared to the conventional regular uniform HD schedules. It showed that frequent dialysis resulted in more effective treatment and higher fitness values. However, when burden was considered, less frequent dialysis schedules showed better fitness value.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#Through this research, GA confirmed that at least 12 h of dialysis should be conducted for a week.

941,"Liquid computing is an effective approach to intelligent computations of neural networks, especially for spiking neural networks. If the liquid network is embedded with a proper structure it can perform complex computational tasks. However, the modeling of self-organized neural networks with more biological characteristics is still an important open challenge, resulting in major constraints on improving the computational capability and dynamical diversity of the model. Here, we present a novel type of liquid computing model with both multi-clustered and active-neuron-dominant structure of spiking neural network, instead of the traditional random structure. The optimal parameter settings of the cluster number and time window size of clustering generation method had been considered. The synaptic weights in each cluster are further refined through the spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to obtain an active-neuron-dominant structure. The results show that this model has much better performance on liquid computing than the random model. The enhancement of information processing capability is achieved by improving two aspects, i.e. the activity synchrony and network sensitivity, based on the clustered structure and active-neuron-dominant structure, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrates that both structure entropy and activity entropy of our proposed network are increased, indicating its high topological complexity and dynamical diversity. Therefore, the improvement in efficiency of signal transmission of this network is confirmed.","['Xiumin Li', 'Hui Liu', 'Fangzheng Xue', 'Hongjun Zhou', 'Yongduan Song']",9f07d418-72de-460a-97f3-8dcf89f7aa04,0,"['13a3fd96-ea8c-4526-a8db-27131ab2f5c6', '141def30-b57b-453e-b101-e21544bdb905', '1955d2b2-f190-4129-b95f-7da445b4c868', '1dc6b9d8-4f59-4ee7-b376-a9040a1b6bdb', '1fba4ea8-eddf-4419-8853-e1bffa2b1dc2', '3918842c-6e2b-4f0a-a927-c88ba3fc7ca6', '4d584f21-5218-4b94-a683-1e86d47cb3e1', '530be0d2-a531-44aa-9581-f3248168e2e8', '664405a3-8846-4968-b047-c6282f1c19f5', '6705a689-0f43-4da8-8f2d-07ad0c4c16b5', '741d6c32-eb2c-46dc-b201-99ba3d5bb488', '78af4506-3750-4a70-ae55-f05656699ca4', '78fc27c9-2afd-4166-9254-fdeba7ba5eae', '7a15c122-fa2a-4d11-b987-1199aa37d659', '8915f385-ec4f-4330-b115-baf63b3b7dd2', 'a8ffccf8-1c92-4772-9be8-8761b0f00764', 'aa980423-cfe9-4d49-bfe7-ebcbf2cfb7b2', 'b40794e8-5c67-4ae6-a723-7173ab0d7b80', 'e677f252-01bf-47ea-b378-9989db409676']",Liquid computing of spiking neural network with multi-clustered and active-neuron-dominant structure,Neurocomputing,2017
942,"Sound events often occur in unstructured environments where they exhibit wide variations in their frequency content and temporal structure. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are able to extract higher level features that are invariant to local spectral and temporal variations. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful in learning the longer term temporal context in the audio signals. CNNs and RNNs as classifiers have recently shown improved performances over established methods in various sound recognition tasks. We combine these two approaches in a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) and apply it on a polyphonic sound event detection task. We compare the performance of the proposed CRNN method with CNN, RNN, and other established methods, and observe a considerable improvement for four different datasets consisting of everyday sound events.","['Emre Cakir', 'Giambattista Parascandolo', 'Toni Heittola', 'Heikki Huttunen', 'Tuomas Virtanen']",f3229ad2-fa35-4371-beb2-6609a1a357e2,50,"['0063b640-385d-4136-adea-1a82c5b97c27', '04b61695-fbbe-4d60-9bd3-8c412cd01445', '119cb40b-35d0-4a45-8843-5bdc6d171ecb', '1504c2a8-8a7c-4544-aeee-27f5fb14fcc9', '2c34b96b-796d-43ac-a41f-30fd4afc81b5', '32fac192-89d7-4cb2-b6c6-f1a4e5fc9bbf', '3715c870-6569-4d20-8797-af8569e5fde5', '3d4f1ae9-1fb3-412f-aaac-21754f59b91b', '3e64cf8b-adc6-4436-8f09-4dc4a33b81ae', '4008e444-18e5-4aa5-9b14-a406749f26b7', '472cdafb-a43c-4da7-9d0f-3b0bc7e18a65', '49639d64-360f-4be1-b5f8-035d167b1f16', '4dd146bf-d718-4e3c-bfd6-aa8ab52fdb25', '546cc930-3d5a-4208-a77b-a506f146ab97', '5ab6ccf2-6aa9-46cb-8da8-189de51ffa48', '5e48cf99-e284-4751-b424-1de371839d92', '65d8bc57-ed10-43a1-9eea-6ff449009e36', '6ab71768-171f-4270-83fd-028ccdfdcc74', '7b102642-0bc5-4431-8a62-99c718cbcdd6', '890fbd0e-5a47-41f4-a561-5f3c5e48248f', '8d1153e6-d84a-41c8-a1df-ae34abbda0cf', '8ea2530b-ca35-4c2b-bf97-fa4b20b85a2a', '93bc6fe3-fa2f-4f22-8d25-0890d7765c39', 'a04592f9-9ff7-4c5d-951a-f946b826073b', 'a2c583ef-d81e-4d15-a93d-59e2afcc3f3d', 'ab5bf7ff-a6f2-4d4e-997e-706da1f70775', 'ad50c28c-a2d0-458b-a9fa-ee85f07e8843', 'aea244a1-f323-4e4c-8dd6-559a8f14eea2', 'b031e64d-40e1-4d43-893e-c668c3cc13c1', 'bff1945c-7b01-4b42-b6c4-1e3601c18a6b', 'c0654e9b-2d39-40e2-bdd0-ad43b17e20bc', 'c9e5ce18-6a6f-445d-87d4-86d32845520f', 'ce0b8fe2-5d35-4265-b200-c7d12e5658ad', 'd994c7b1-970b-4e27-86e3-4e888f4aaeb0', 'da51a90a-f7fc-464f-8f68-e1b6d08802b9', 'e0996388-7422-4ba4-b0b0-2ee29f08fd3a', 'e2f7a74a-8430-4463-94ce-fe85dfd309f9', 'efc40b40-5e02-4b20-a329-0ad5bcda2b33', 'f158456a-c3f0-4eb3-ab09-9e4f01b6971d', 'f58f603b-23d5-47d1-ac75-2b9bc4890b76', 'f64b5ccd-849a-4ac1-97ff-f34842543115', 'f94b1b06-2a94-48aa-9028-fe31fd17716b', 'ff770f1f-7848-451c-9a56-932df55024b7']",Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Polyphonic Sound Event Detection,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",2017

We investigate the complementarity between simulation and experimentation studies by evaluating latest features available among open testbeds (e.g., energy monitoring, mobility). We show that monitoring tools and control channels of testbeds allow for identification of crucial issues (e.g., energy consumption, link quality) and we identify some opportunities to leverage those real-life obstacles. In this context, we insist on how simulations and experimentations can be efficiently and successfully coupled with each other in order to obtain reproducible scientific results, rather than sole proofs-of-concept. Indeed, we especially highlight the main characteristics of such evaluation tools that allow to run multiple instances of a same experimental setup over stable and finely controlled components of hardware and real-world environment. For our experiments, we used and evaluated the FIT IoT-LAB facility. Our results show that such open platforms, can guarantee a certain stability of hardware and environment components over time, thus, turning the unexpected failures and changing parameters into core experimental parameters and valuable inputs for enhanced performance evaluation.","['Georgios Z.

945,"Image quality assessment models prefer an effective visual feature to perceive image quality. Structure-based image quality metrics have verified that a measure of structural information change can provide a good approximation to perceived image distortion. Furthermore, psychological studies have suggested that human beings awareness on image structures is perception-driven and the human visual system (HVS) is more sensitive to the distortion on dominant structures rather than on minor textures. Accordingly, the image distortion can be perceived well by measuring the information loss of the dominant structures. Considering two conclusive psychovisual observations—anisotropy and local directionality—this paper takes a more comprehensive analysis on the behavior of structures and textures, and introduces a directional anisotropic structure measurement (DASM) to represent the dominant structures that are visually important. The proposed DASM can well identify dominant structures, to which the HVS is highly sensitive, from minor textures. Using the DASM as a visual feature, we assess image quality by measuring its degradations. The proposed method was tested on the six benchmark databases and the experimental results demonstrate that our method obtains good performance and correlates well with the human perception.","['Li Ding', 'Hua Huang', 'Yu Zang']",c1a7be95-135b-49a7-a7ac-4739526b2524,0,"['016e3dfb-350a-40c1-872f-ed1b8be4108a', '02acc8f4-e6d9-4958-bd08-a1185631f22a', '07fe8cfc-52bd-4bd2-bdba-89b3fc98a5fe', '108636db-2116-426d-a6a5-e5ebc2c8f781', '2aca8900-e4b0-448a-b7a9-864f9829c2ba', '3bea704d-bc63-4340-95a9-6b37ff2ba664', '3ed2f39a-dcf8-4b54-a5c4-73528a690fff', '3f61fd08-ac16-4551-bdc6-60373f8479c9', '47e8d775-8d7e-4b2f-befd-29513eb42e99', '51bc6113-d986-4e24-a3c0-373173afe682', '6a22e940-436a-492e-aa6c-4775f5b03704', '6bd23ecc-9ba4-4d2c-a8b5-5d60cabed53e', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '80010e60-9a14-416f-b1f2-9f2459105920', '83ba1a29-95cc-4f6a-a071-972adbfb7b08', '959221a0-cdbb-4835-ba35-bcae20d709f1', '9887d743-229e-4949-af74-ab43cf7929a4', '9ad5a482-0613-4f30-b051-feba003ade93', '9dd77a8e-e857-4d71-858f-ef38e37393f1', 'a02408ac-4722-4491-bc1b-07d5b0f48e82', 'a3218d27-3254-4f93-bd89-59b15468b1a7', 'abac5d26-3cf0-4a7e-94d2-f01e43db4426', 'c8742fc4-c8ec-407c-8690-b1b148840dab', 'c95513a4-bfd6-49be-a274-00de863f04d7', 'd2275b1f-5443-4243-a1ed-c840ba187d87', 'dd4eb389-91ba-498c-b37e-ff757fd1a30f', 'f1b81247-6ea9-424f-b3e1-4e300f8008e4', 'f51ad523-21bd-4e12-b13c-08f434a59eb3', 'fcd32ec7-8a0f-41bc-bcc2-417edc8cbc96', 'feaeb613-4a8e-4a0b-9de4-b3873917555d']",Image Quality Assessment Using Directional Anisotropy Structure Measurement,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
946,"This paper advances the theoretical understanding of online customer experience in the context of e-shopping. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of experience, the relevant prior theories and definitions vary. This paper explores what an online shopping experience is as constructed by consumers, using their own words. Adopting Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory (PCT), twenty-three repertory grid interviews were conducted and analysed using multi-coder qualitative content analysis (with an inter-reliability score of 76%). The findings highlight the fluid nature of experience and its construction (emotional, perceptual, situational and behavioural). The variations in meaning explored in otherwise mutually agreed abstractions of what an experience is suggest a need for a strong emphasis on the individualistic dynamic nature of experience, both in theoretical and methodological terms. Accordingly, the paper contributes to theory by adopting a holistic approach that allows a definition of experience from the user's perspective, thus challenging current perspectives on the online shopping experience, and particularly on the emotion, risk perception and situational variables. Key managerial implications for online businesses are provided by highlighting the importance of finding better ways of managing the individualistic experience by focusing on dynamic customer journeys.","['Fatema Kawaf', 'Stephen Tagg']",370e2a86-53a0-4dd9-9404-1fb87a882157,0,"['051e5db3-0def-4e83-9fa6-3f07e943494d', '091ee4d2-1e9d-41c2-a3f8-48d588a6c159', '24a0fa43-3b8b-4e2a-b4b0-1ee253ed6d19', '2995b364-4d50-416a-9810-648e1dfb125d', '4fca8148-2c0c-4ae4-b8c4-86d099b77ada', '74de0d2d-65b9-4d01-8446-1ba4249d7eda', '7def87da-f0ac-478e-853b-e9b5923e17f6', '855bc48f-c5b0-4c83-a513-d1b292e8c80e', '9028fb4f-c044-4d84-9818-dc66e8820673', '9759da83-5518-4693-98a1-d721bcfa7396', '9da217ba-4027-465a-9b62-c938a26c236f', 'abce9cab-caf3-4335-827c-f0be186feac1', 'ceea02a8-b7d0-4871-9887-c12e725b8c4a', 'e831f9a2-fc6d-4e68-978e-14a9f29e1d49', 'eca7b750-8479-42b5-b2fd-7dc2083449c1']",The construction of online shopping experience : a repertory grid approach,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
947,"This study reports the effect of different types of thermo-mechanical excursion (TME) on growth of intermetallic compound (IMC) layer formed at the interface of Sn-3.0%Ag-0.5%Cu solder and Cu substrate. 1 mm thick solder joints were prepared by reflowing at 270 °C for either 60 or 90 s. Solder joints were then exposed to one of the following TME: (i) isothermal aging at 60 °C for 48, 96 and 144 h, (ii) thermal cycling between − 25 and 125 °C for 100, 200 and 400 cycles, and (iii) thermo-mechanical cycling between − 25 and 125 °C for 100, 200 and 400 cycles, wherein a shear strain of 10% per cycle was imposed on the joint. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed to ascertain the effects of imposed shear strain and volumetric expansion due to the formation of IMC on the stress field in the solder joint. Irrespective of the type of TME, the thickness of the IMC layer increased with time. However, IMC thickness increased relatively more rapidly under thermo-mechanical cycling condition, indicating strain enhanced coarsening of the interfacial IMC layer. FEA showed that high stresses were generated in the IMC layer and near solder-IMC interface due to the formation of IMC layer as well as imposed external strain, which might then not only enhance the IMC growth kinetics, but also affect the morphology of the IMC layer.","['Rituparna Ghosh', 'Anwesha Kanjilal', 'Praveen Kumar']",77e28abd-c002-48cc-a3b6-b695b209de95,0,[],Effect of type of thermo-mechanical excursion on growth of interfacial intermetallic compounds in Cu/Sn-Ag-Cu solder joints,Microelectronics Reliability,2017

The obtained results show that the fault tolerance of Kautz networks is nice.","['Shangwei Lin', 'Chanchan Zhou', 'Chunfang Li']",1ad15e65-2b52-443c-a35d-29a630449c70,0,"['3241356e-19e0-4b6f-8277-38e3daeb873b', '35543b5b-ef79-4ce2-af3a-24c49b2519ed', '3c80b5e1-074d-4603-880c-126450ef1ece', '3d6aadf1-fbd8-4333-9224-d344cfbd1a0a', '3e313151-3904-4c97-b83d-d7d91372df84', '4609ae27-ee8b-4f24-92e5-8d419dc9d87f', '5d9f56e4-0fcb-43cd-92cd-45c4505963f0', '6ac53b99-7775-4e7c-9e34-7858a70b08ea', '7d8be1c5-db5e-42db-bba6-30bec7e79f06', '9b3b923e-d002-4428-8a4f-44fbe2709422', 'a3a5d717-a616-4452-bbeb-62ce9914d6e8', 'b014bda1-b93c-4ee3-adaf-cd2c85c4becf', 'b4055a1f-64d3-4fc9-9f9d-baab31ce8ce0', 'c2094df7-5b5f-4f64-aa21-cefe5612e453', 'dbe60237-1dfb-4808-9c96-a99d0a26d585']",Arc fault tolerance of Kautz digraphs,Theoretical Computer Science,2017
949,"Heritability of a phenotypic or molecular trait measures the proportion of variance that is attributable to genotypic variance. It is an important concept in breeding and genetics. Few methods are available for calculating heritability for traits derived from high-throughput sequencing. We propose several statistical models and different methods to compute and test a heritability measure for such data based on linear and generalized linear mixed effects models. We also provide methodology for hypothesis testing and interval estimation. Our analyses show that, among the methods, the negative binomial mixed model (NB-fit), compound Poisson mixed model (CP-fit), and the variance stabilizing transformed linear mixed model (VST) outperform the voom-transformed linear mixed model (voom). NB-fit and VST appear to be more robust than CP-fit for estimating and testing the heritability scores, while NB-fit is the most computationally expensive. CP-fit performed best in terms of the coverage of the confidence intervals. In addition, we applied the methods to both microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing datasets from a recombinant inbred mouse panel. We show that miRNA and mRNA expression can be a highly heritable molecular trait in mouse, and that some top heritable features coincide with expression quantitative trait loci. The models and methods we investigated in this manuscript is applicable and extendable to sequencing experiments where some biological replicates are available and the environmental variation is properly controlled. The CP-fit approach for assessing heritability was implemented for the first time to our knowledge. All the methods presented, as well as the generation of simulated sequencing data under either negative binomial or compound Poisson mixed models, are provided in the R package HeritSeq.","['Pratyaydipta Rudra', 'W.

950,"As more and more data are generated in an electronic format, the necessity of a data recovery service has increased, and the development of more efficient data backup and recovery technology has been an important issue during the past decade. While lots of effective backup and recovery technologies have been developed for enterprise level, little work has been done for convenient and inexpensive personal data recovery service, i.e., cloud storage service is still inadequate or expensive for backing up tera-scale HDDs. Furthermore, since privacy protection is a crucial issue for providing a personal data recovery service, a plain data backup-based recovery service is not adequate for public service. Users are reluctant to upload their data to internet backup servers until they can fully trust the service provider in terms of privacy protection. We propose a novel data recovery service framework on cloud infrastructure, a parity cloud service, which provides privacy-protected personal data recovery service while requiring a small storage space in the cloud. The proposed framework does not require any user data to be uploaded to the server, but only parity data are uploaded to the server for user data recovery. Also, the necessary server-side resources for providing the service are within a reasonable bound, depending on the data recoverability and recovery time.","['Hyungsoo Jung', 'Yongsu Park', 'Chi-won Song', 'Sooyong Kang']",55193fed-b412-48c5-b1d3-7be6e3f36839,0,"['4210fb99-f31a-4f49-a8ed-fd89d853bd6c', '52c8653d-6f7c-479d-b8d7-92344edad133', '5cbd4b32-93fd-468e-9218-a649773c97fd', '8158bb89-bf74-4773-a477-18d90583936c', '83dd4552-f05e-4388-a928-bcaa1f4deb81', 'a5228bfc-3b56-4653-b913-723e19cb48f8', 'b2c3667a-2c99-4b79-81e1-b7d2af8fbdba', 'bcf67098-1813-4c0a-98c4-cbe32b20d06a', 'cf624826-a6d1-4a1b-8f5a-b3c63fc3b8c5', 'db0f61d8-c8cc-428f-ac1f-710f10b16b4d']",PCS: a parity-based personal data recovery service in cloud,Cluster Computing,2017

In this study, we characterize the feasible region of a complex model of the budding yeast cell cycle under a large set of discrete experimental constraints in order to test whether the statistical features of relative protein abundance predictions are influenced by the topology of the cell cycle regulatory network.","['Cihan Oguz', 'Layne T.

953,"The effects which interviewers exert on the collection of ego-centric networks have recently come into the focus of methodological considerations. Studies consistently show that the size of networks varies depending on the interviewer. We would like to expand on this research strand by pointing to different aspects which have so far gone unremarked in the discussion. First, size is mainly analysed as a network measure which is influenced during data collection, while other common measures such as network density or composition have not received sufficient consideration. Second, large-scale surveys using face-to-face interviews usually allocate interviewers to a single sampling point. Differences between sampling points (locality effects) are attributed to interviewer effects. Hence, we disentangle the effects of the locality and interviewer. Third, the discussion on interviewer effects often follows an “actor-oriented” consideration of how data collection situations are structured by interviewers. Expanding this approach from a relational perspective, we consider the relationship between the interviewers and respondents and whether this relationship influences the collection of network data. To test our hypotheses about the influence of interviewers, the locality and the interviewer-respondent relationship on different network measures, we use data from the 2010 German General Social Survey (n = 2827 respondents, n = 220 interviewers). The multilevel analyses show that the relationship between the interviewer and the respondent is not very relevant. Furthermore, the analyses show that interviewers have an influence on the network size but not on measures of their composition. However, evidence on the prevalence of locality or interviewer effects is mixed. Finally, homophilous interviewer-respondent relationships have very little effect on network characteristics. We find evidence of training and fatigue effects on network size. However, much of the variation in network size caused by the interviewer still remains unexplained. We draw conclusions on how to organize interview situations in surveys.","['Andreas Herz', 'Sören Petermann']",68ddfe6c-bcee-4048-b5b5-e72290d49116,0,"['006823f7-acda-4bfd-ab8e-798f5a87deec', '0798f3c3-ac07-4c43-83ec-b5c6d34a438e', '480020d0-0c3d-4533-9b81-1ecd0a7c9dbe', '4fe3de41-f1d7-4013-9387-a16c0056dc9e', '666fe967-f192-4ec7-9961-5d36d95836f3', 'd7686182-5012-4f3b-b393-c2474161b17a', 'e8ded498-7ced-45e3-af23-88679c0ecd9e']",Beyond interviewer effects in the standardized measurement of ego-centric networks,Social Networks,2017
954,"AbstractIntense competition requires that social media service providers execute two major business strategies: exploiting current functions while simultaneously exploring incremental innovation. Realization of these strategies is related to two types of member behavior: reinforced use and varied use. Drawing on identity theories, we examine the common and differential effects of two levels of social self-identity—relational identity and social identity—on reinforced and varied use and the moderating role of inertia on their effects on social media usage. Our results reveal that, although both identities have similar effects on usage behavior, users with higher social identities are more oriented toward variety seeking, while those with stronger relational identities are more oriented toward reinforcement. Inertia negatively moderates the impacts of social identity on social media use, but not the relationships between relational identity and social media use.

955,"Synchronous transmission has been exploited recently for accelerating fundamental operations of wireless sensor networks like data dissemination, data collection, and network-wide agreement by an order of magnitude. Although these protocols (e.g., Glossy) have shown to be highly reliable for small packet sizes, the use of large packet sizes coupled with an excessive number of simultaneous transmissions can reduce reliability significantly. Our work is motivated by the observation that capture effect can improve the reliability of synchronous transmission. We experimentally study the effect of physical layer capture and identify guidelines in which it can be exploited to enhance reliability. Based on these observations, we propose Syncast, a data dissemination protocol that improves over Glossy by exploiting capture effect over multichannels. The evaluation shows that Syncast provides a robust, reliable, and scalable data dissemination of large packets with lower end-to-end delay and up to 92% reduced radio-on-time.","['Mobashir Mohammad', 'Manjunath Doddavenkatappa', 'Mun Choon Chan']",68428b8b-0b52-41eb-b1ca-dadf0be96e94,0,"['19fd97b0-7da3-42d8-8e20-e56f65033e59', '32a99b74-dbae-455f-89e9-5f326fe901b8', '35c12092-efaa-40af-b2be-d20e89698fd1', '3ee871c5-05ef-4f28-97a5-0d0c9a6614bd', '470b431f-7107-49c4-a5dc-7de48381805d', '492f488d-1824-4ba2-85d1-b96f14cc1a36', '514d7318-0ee6-4ba8-a33b-c32a87285bfe', '51f1e7fd-0de2-40a1-8593-1ad6f0fac953', '6400aeb0-4314-4b34-a141-e20b009cfd12', '6cc24ddc-0411-4877-af07-80d4aa8ed33e', '746d21e6-6e37-4e09-b3c4-02c18ce5d0b1', '7574f934-d74a-4b55-ac61-481a9e34e58e', '7bc77e01-0bb0-432c-a408-a0d0c4f0e3c4', '80eae794-32ad-415b-a8d0-6ae4fa85203d', 'ab7ae798-1cde-41a3-99a1-3e232964f9a8', 'afcb495a-b525-45e7-99c8-ad215aac45e1', 'b3af16f7-7c6b-4cd9-a948-f852683b87b0', 'b47812ba-a018-4b18-abb6-8548160375fc', 'b5b8132d-0a8c-4e6c-999f-839f0cef48b7', 'd23ec3fe-3ab6-47a0-8324-59da55667533', 'd49eb604-0c9c-450d-b650-c1f39ad0c2b0', 'd8164b0c-6d5d-48a7-b1e2-7a54c5f2636c', 'df9e74b6-11d7-4f50-a5e8-651595aff27d', 'dff25eb5-719a-444c-87bd-9a4ed57e595f', 'e2ed1093-7749-419b-8a6e-e4088a15fcfa', 'ee4d57a4-27c5-4378-9ef1-28720f2318c6', 'f41281da-42bd-4980-9e9b-438dfa0b5327']",Improving Performance of Synchronous Transmission-Based Protocols Using Capture Effect over Multichannels,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,2017

In this paper, smart malware model is defined as emerging complex malware that may be used by defense systems to perceive complex malware and reacting to its attacks. A targeted attack is also presented to show the difficulty of defending systems against smart malware. It is also compared with conventional malware to analyze malware types. Moreover, a numerical study about smart malware is presented to evaluate the proposed model in a more precise manner. The comparison and the numerical study show that our model can be used to perceive smart malware autonomously by automated tools.

958,"In this paper, the multaiband cooperative spectrum sensing problem in cognitive radio network is investigated, which focuses on maximizing the total throughput under the constraint of the interference to primary users by jointly optimizing weight coefficients and decision threshold. Due to the non-convex characteristics of this optimization problem, a modified artificial bee colony (MABC) algorithm is proposed to deal with this problem, in which some improved mechanisms, such as mutation and crossover factors are introduced in ABC to enhance the diversity and improve the searching ability. Classical benchmark functions are employed to evaluate the searching ability of MABC when compared with PSO, GA, ABC and EA-ABC. Simulation results have been provided to validate the promising performance of MABC over the other intelligent evolutionary algorithms when applied to both the classical benchmark functions and multiband cooperative spectrum sensing scenario.","['Min Li', 'Yongqiang Hei', 'Zhuo Qiu']",75e1041e-501f-482b-93d7-e6538fecc4bc,0,"['2437f430-5f82-4e9b-9d3d-b9a07a976392', '31d49379-a4b7-45c7-b9f9-2b5c8b39f075', '31fdd75f-4b5e-4681-9659-26064be28c54', '32a6ea1c-7894-44b0-af3b-24b6825a4ea3', '6fc9205f-e9a2-4426-881e-c850dc5feb5b', '81dcf96b-4af9-4c25-9781-b63b078f0e15', '9d0e0971-9c13-4e03-b642-319ffc3b2d6a', 'a0015372-679f-4e0f-b061-94574fa58fd7', 'b6e954e0-f2d7-48d5-baf0-0dab0d2344c5', 'd1718912-e34c-4b07-9c28-9b166ae5e916', 'e84d8ac0-dd7d-4253-bf0e-f3fc76e5232d']",Optimization of multiband cooperative spectrum sensing with modified artificial bee colony algorithm,Applied Soft Computing,2017
959,"A linearized Crank–Nicolson Galerkin finite element method with bilinear element for nonlinear Schrodinger equation is studied. By splitting the error into two parts which are called the temporal error and the spatial error, the unconditional superconvergence result is deduced. On one hand, the regularity for a time-discrete system is presented based on the proof of the temporal error. On the other hand, the classical Ritz projection is applied to get the spatial error with order \(O(h^2)\) in \(L^2\)-norm, which plays an important role in getting rid of the restriction of \(\tau \). Then the superclose estimates of order \(O(h^2+\tau ^2)\) in \(H^1\)-norm is arrived at based on the relationship between the Ritz projection and the interpolated operator. At the same time, global superconvergence property is arrived at by the interpolated postprocessing technique. At last, three numerical examples are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis. Here, h is the subdivision parameter and \(\tau \) is the time step.","['Dongyang Shi', 'Junjun Wang']",9d270921-db7f-4e87-85bb-64bbeda788df,0,"['0881fcca-6f54-47cc-9b83-07f3998c617e', '0d957183-d001-4325-bd25-d185c7f6722c', '1440cc70-49b8-4a18-a647-5361f67c0b6d', '16ab24ff-4617-4a2f-859b-824244742fe6', '3322f087-209c-4e66-9e39-c9b25e9e4516', '359c5d2c-1d28-441a-9f47-1b6accf53329', '4a95ac7f-fdf0-445c-b72d-0502eac36086', '5278d918-abd4-4824-bf93-56cef83a2951', '5d76579e-e7a0-432a-b8bc-0ce89e1615d9', '735c834b-21a7-48dd-87a4-3b20511ff1eb', '8a84a0a3-e4a3-4aba-a6c8-fcd65073ee0b', '92f4ef5f-10df-4db2-9e03-6060c93c9f18', '973a9c3f-f1da-4d3e-824d-f03be9bb9ffd', 'a169f255-200d-4258-8900-4088adfd3d0b', 'cf781fb4-65ac-4561-a8ef-3cf214271bc0', 'e0c29ee5-2fcc-4808-9357-cac25b3a98b4']",Unconditional Superconvergence Analysis of a Crank–Nicolson Galerkin FEM for Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation,Journal of Scientific Computing,2017
960,"According to dichromatic reflection model, the previous methods of specular reflection separation in image processing often separate specular reflection from a single image using patch-based priors. Due to lack of global information, these methods often cannot completely separate the specular component of an image and are incline to degrade image textures. In this paper, we derive a global color-lines constraint from dichromatic reflection model to effectively recover specular and diffuse reflection. Our key observation is from that each image pixel lies along a color line in normalized RGB space and the different color lines representing distinct diffuse chromaticities intersect at one point, namely, the illumination chromaticity. For pixels along the same color line, they spread over the entire image and their distances to the illumination chromaticity reflect the amount of specular reflection components. With global (non-local) information from these color lines, our method can effectively separate specular and diffuse reflection components in a pixelwise way for a single image, and it is suitable for real-time applications. Our experimental results on synthetic and real images show that our method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods to separate specular reflection.","['Weihong Ren', 'Jiandong Tian', 'Yandong Tang']",51e18d24-d4ec-49b1-a6bb-cc8d92a91f35,0,"['191dd7d8-886d-4a56-959a-b4794652d28f', '19a66ff1-5f84-461f-980e-ae51911f585c', '1b331e3f-ccf9-4b08-a8de-8527ce1a7291', '446ccf1c-233f-4fa8-af5e-b912a774365e', '45378b86-dcdc-49d5-9b54-cca6da5f3b47', '58d47ee0-2697-4795-9faa-14c1eb878d56', '617f2e06-e1f7-450b-9963-3a4718ac0e56', '7c360bc7-0d15-4da9-a8ae-5112f2605841', '7e7f4fd5-058e-4ce5-a175-91396a828cf0', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '86acd0ce-8d92-4384-816e-4c8c9f0cdd30', '910a223b-1f53-4100-a600-6cce47c85f1d', '955427e6-be76-454f-892b-72bda2981ae3', '9df26197-da53-4d26-bef3-ad901a60ced9', '9faad812-a7b9-4525-b30b-b4edf3c5e787', 'a9bf5842-af08-4eae-8bef-9b3d22bf204a', 'b3a4feeb-0d9c-4a10-89d3-8ca0852d04e7', 'be36dd3b-800e-4e3d-996d-e62e8cf5d31b', 'ce92b133-b6fc-40f7-b643-c14e806ea131', 'd225c00c-7870-4e6d-9b96-10dc4aa32f13', 'e12eb32d-6aa5-4582-aa05-ea661080be67', 'f2d49150-35de-4fd5-ac46-eb071d1cc73e', 'f2f6ee07-7416-4ae2-8280-079af3092835']",Specular Reflection Separation With Color-Lines Constraint,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017

963,"In this paper, we propose a novel sorting algorithm that sorts input data integer elements on-the-fly without any comparison operations between the data—comparison-free sorting. We present a complete hardware structure, associated timing diagrams, and a formal mathematical proof, which show an overall sorting time, in terms of clock cycles, that is linearly proportional to the number of inputs, giving a speed complexity on the order of O(N). Our hardware-based sorting algorithm precludes the need for SRAM-based memory or complex circuitry, such as pipelining structures, but rather uses simple registers to hold the binary elements and the elements’ associated number of occurrences in the input set, and uses matrix-mapping operations to perform the sorting process. Thus, the total transistor count complexity is on the order of O(N). We evaluate an application-specified integrated circuit design of our sorting algorithm for a sample sorting of N = 1024 elements of size K = 10-bit using 90-nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) technology with a 1 V power supply. Results verify that our sorting requires approximately 4–   $6~\mu \text{s},$    to sort the 1024 elements with a clock cycle time of 0.5 GHz, consumes 1.6 mW of power, and has a total transistor count of less than 750 000.","['Saleh Abdel-Hafeez', 'Ann Gordon-Ross']",1bf76218-863c-471f-90d2-373bddf3837a,0,"['05de822e-5f72-436c-94ed-938a73d12c80', '1e605c0b-dc1f-489c-ad5a-8cd364d0e79d', '29dff536-f2a7-46a8-90db-8cbbbb6ceef3', '380fc78b-e420-4167-879f-fca605014ccc', '446ae032-37a0-42ad-a849-87a8ad891e7e', '47b1d2c6-e97c-410d-9ab4-3a0968569d21', '4ca5f371-aec0-46e1-8b00-09adae300bba', '5235e21b-b818-44c8-8297-9ab4fd1832e8', '5962b6fc-f899-416e-abb1-be0da0e91971', '5a775f0b-a0b3-4b6e-b0da-1339a09bdefb', '63234563-09ad-4453-a002-3558ea8379e7', '6dad081d-2b75-4199-b094-072ce150f809', '777b4a36-796c-4c04-b502-1935a1272539', '810d20f0-b962-47b5-936e-d2d4e6a95460', '9a17eed6-df5d-46d9-95f9-02175c9987db', '9cfd57fc-2a9e-4b2f-87d9-b63a5af0676b', '9ea7d02f-ab60-4aa0-b08b-d3c648cdaea0', 'a0175bdc-d9d0-4fc5-bf64-e77b29337430', 'c327e10c-f235-4642-a1a1-b000d0f3c600', 'cd4300ab-4713-45e1-a35d-1c497e962de8', 'd2cfaf80-85d8-4b7f-b1d2-296f08d0b018', 'd3a73607-7417-4931-acae-d04f07c46744', 'e7c19455-c59b-431c-aaa9-f3c482110701']",An Efficient O( $N$ ) Comparison-Free Sorting Algorithm,IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems,2017
964,"From one perspective, tighter security screening has the benefit of deterring adversary passengers and enhancing safety. However, this approach can also produce congestion problems for normal passengers. Adapting to screening policies, both adversary and normal passengers decide their application strategies to the security system to maximize their payoffs, which in turn affects the security agent's payoff. This paper integrates game theory and queueing theory to analyze an  N -stage imperfect screening model that considers reject or pass decisions, in which applicants have the chance to be passed or rejected at each stage of the system. An imperfect three-stage screening model is numerically illustrated. Furthermore, the application probabilities, screening probabilities and approver's payoff as functions of the number of screening stages are analyzed. This paper provides some novel insights on screening policies and the optimal number of screening stages which would help security screening policy makers.","['Cen Song', 'Jun Zhuang']",eef594d1-5c32-4e19-a172-965c4a0fafb6,50,"['094b505c-4111-49a9-b871-e7da1a7edfd0', '13d11cb2-d1ef-46cc-84f7-e4a796025316', '15cd7a22-b5b3-450c-ac8f-c177fed1cd62', '1eb33d0f-fe5a-4571-baa2-137e4d3442aa', '222a25ea-257f-4d21-98c1-88682562b11a', '2ebe6ed2-c5ee-472e-a745-752782ce5c61', '52dcfc6d-108a-45f9-92f1-4308c9bc7662', '59b83513-b5fa-4ec1-a26d-2dff9f3177fa', '650c709c-9edb-43cf-bdca-80508aa23dd2', '6b0878aa-3325-4d79-8ca1-d5b5b1353e84', '8db9ce72-2d52-420d-a20b-ce10d518c342', '925d7acb-8eea-47b6-9ddd-dafed7166d22', '9d3c867f-0659-454b-8b85-63a52265f730', 'c15f4bbb-aaf7-4d58-a93f-60ea14e6717f', 'c2a0d7fc-1f73-4186-9611-bfc386d06ebf', 'c70bd7d4-658d-4255-8020-d39c4c05f065', 'ce5ade23-b368-40ea-a808-01f764a44077', 'd52eab56-dc2f-4fef-a4a3-9d7a88a6ad3c', 'daf2679b-3e8e-413f-93d0-0a13cdc150aa', 'ddc75376-759c-4785-b036-149ea2b34be2', 'df2b281b-d04e-4d14-89d9-c8ec0f3a68ed', 'f4a997bf-d53b-4153-afa7-458527d7f8b7', 'fe527727-e91b-435b-a680-c31df10bc977']",N -stage security screening strategies in the face of strategic applicants,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,2017
965,"Consider a graph G with n vertices. On each vertex we place a box. The n vertices and n boxes are each numbered from 1 to n, and initially shuffled according to a permutation \(\pi \). A single robot is given the task to sort these boxes. In every step, the robot can walk along an edge of the graph and can carry at most one box at a time. At a vertex, it may swap the box placed there with the box it is carrying. How many steps does the robot need to sort all the boxes? We present efficient algorithms that construct such a shortest sorting walk if G is a path or a tree, and we show that the problem is \(\mathcal {NP},\)-complete for planar graphs. If we minimize the number of swaps in addition to the number of walking steps, it is \(\mathcal {NP},\)-complete even if G is a tree.",['D.

966,"We present an investigation of the potential use of Hopfield networks to learn neurally plausible, distributed representations of category prototypes. Hopfield networks are dynamical models of autoassociative memory which learn to recreate a set of input states from any given starting state. These networks, however, will almost always learn states which were not presented during training, so called spurious states. Historically, spurious states have been an undesirable side-effect of training a Hopfield network and there has been much research into detecting and discarding these unwanted states. However, we suggest that some of these states may represent useful information, namely states which represent  prototypes  of the categories instantiated in the network’s training data. It would be desirable for a memory system trained on multiple instance tokens of a category to extract a representation of the category prototype. We present an investigation showing that Hopfield networks are in fact capable of learning category prototypes as strong, stable, attractors without being explicitly trained on them. We also expand on previous research into the detection of spurious states in order to show that it is possible to distinguish between trained, spurious, and prototypical attractors.","['Chris Gorman', 'Anthony V.

967,"With the combination of the adaptive backstepping technique and small-gain approach, the adaptive fuzzy tracking control for a class of uncertain single-input and single-output (SISO) nonlinear systems with unmodeled dynamics, dynamic disturbances, unknown dead zone output and unmeasurable states is studied. The designed controller guarantees that all the signals of the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded, and the output of the closed-loop system converges to a small neighborhood of the desired output. In addition, only three adaptive parameters need to be updated online, which simplifies the structure of the controller and promotes the implementation of the proposed scheme in engineering. A Nussbaum-type function is introduced to overcome the difficulty caused by the non-sensitivity of the output in the dead band. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","['Hang Su', 'Tianliang Zhang', 'Weihai Zhang']",917ebb3d-4d49-4026-bc0b-319db03ad377,0,"['040ba41e-0ca8-4897-9401-9e1885b24748', '08b159b7-bc8a-4a4c-9357-ecca61578296', '09a93c63-e97e-4bc9-a865-09b425971994', '0b595d8b-54f7-4d1f-8a02-872bd25557fc', '100a1ddc-ccd6-4e4f-8fe0-39e68afdb4e7', '1d60d09d-926c-4be0-aa2f-245b2f91ff99', '223dd257-42bf-4ae5-8418-1b5041eac3ec', '323a2ec4-da67-41fb-8e20-971dce4b7ee6', '3620d0d0-3322-431d-bae9-3b1598e9d39b', '3faa6244-4283-4ece-b8f4-3ffe32b7653d', '41ce3709-9395-4443-bc45-41fd776670f7', '5073b9a4-0941-45f1-bb33-cd1eb5115026', '5b745c21-c576-478a-a1a5-e2a494aa6e79', '65444874-375f-4fcf-9094-be4a6dc5d818', '766b8e61-27a6-4d50-9328-d098d9bb8951', '7a1c187d-20ae-4b38-b052-dbdf17d6d2c9', '8c1871d7-4f13-46e0-930b-4ee8e406c13b', '93210458-980d-4b12-887d-635b989fa41a', '94fd6293-fd44-4bdc-83d6-87b7674fca4f', '987edb01-d76b-496a-a31d-3d58d2da998c', '9ab8f204-bb89-4c08-8380-c7c82c8cac2d', 'a84af9af-be2b-49d5-8a5b-c3b702b043f8', 'b11e6cfe-c1f7-483c-bddb-55d5be4db93d', 'c338d055-aba1-4114-a9fd-1cb2287ba166', 'c6964389-e3a9-4eb7-80ce-406a63e07dd6', 'd40a9e6c-4d69-4139-909c-caf1863cce5f', 'd7712409-b59c-4422-9cd7-d5d45116d66a', 'df5316aa-2a61-4722-8797-75b37f19a93f', 'ed9193a7-8adf-48e0-8977-408119985523', 'efa2b6a1-50c3-4683-9269-0c8c3ab7a6ee', 'f9b185ce-eda7-46c2-b5bd-54f85d4ff53e', 'fae741f1-0c78-4892-a946-cdf08e7310fc']",Fuzzy adaptive control for SISO nonlinear uncertain systems based on backstepping and small-gain approach,Neurocomputing,2017

Although several methods have recently been proposed for solving this problem on distributed systems, these methods have not been able to meet the fundamental necessity of a typical method on large-scale distributed systems, i.e., scalability.#R##N##R##N#This paper presents Fractal, a fully decentralized and highly scalable multidimensional range query lookup protocol for distributed systems. In this work, to organize the available nodes in the system, an n-dimensional space called Key Space is utilized. The available nodes on the nested Fractal rings maintain information about only O(logN) other nodes, and the Fractal lookup protocol discovers the destination node through these nested rings with a logarithmic cost. Because of its flexibility, Fractal allows the system to create a concept called Layering, which minimizes the probability of the wide-area message transfers (WAMTs) during the lookup process. Using several criteria, Fractal is compared with several successful methods that have recently been presented. Simulation results show the efficiency and performance of Fractal in networks of different sizes.","['Saeed Kargar', 'Leyli Mohammad-Khanli']",336e6aff-e5da-408b-a972-dc062d8d80ba,0,"['0e207640-c292-4d2b-9a2d-ecb1c6c23619', '0ed5adfb-a499-4ada-9b73-7207c89b0466', '12431b7c-d813-40da-897f-d7d9c5b6fbdf', '21aee6f4-3497-4e9b-8fd5-01419cc85f47', '231a4e3e-fc18-4896-b3cd-b4be8f4b3052', '243a2e20-d4ab-47e8-8bdc-2bb81491fbfd', '24ea601f-1886-4f74-b4ee-47ceecf9a0a1', '2fcc8ac2-bd5d-4c9e-b6e3-d46b667315f1', '315eb44d-6d58-4040-82d6-49e6391b914c', '31eda710-5275-400e-ac6a-7f1f6d1759b0', '3223b705-5c07-4e18-9fb0-e2d9bddb0952', '36c05ec1-7f89-44d4-a180-49820c36e4a0', '3ab56020-becb-424e-bec1-52cbf52e17eb', '3bca11aa-52dc-4747-bddc-2242c14be6f1', '3d928ab3-3130-4cc7-870e-2c4643ece60a', '42e8c869-48d8-404d-8660-8306cfb3e2e5', '47160c82-a249-4904-bb61-e3081e452a88', '47331a4f-22c2-4677-809c-9804d8af9950', '4c36f482-1f7d-4a6c-a6f9-2e0a5b7056a4', '4d6778de-1826-4c4c-945d-03319b320669', '52b90d7e-ded6-4331-a4cd-21f859f1eef3', '537fde25-6f93-4dd7-8a5d-e5b4176672ae', '5b9c110a-9849-4c46-a84d-4ca797db2611', '5c1c366a-617b-48d4-8f04-33923ec93ced', '5d2fa005-adbf-4a32-9556-7ab50a51fc76', '624fe9ff-5ddd-40f1-96c2-a8e6d113748b', '69d08d24-3bba-4fdc-8068-db0be40b3c29', '6e3638b7-1a0b-4290-9e10-03045cbd7c54', '6eff83a4-db80-40ea-8c9f-8bda5f506c29', '7c0564e2-bb4c-4bb8-b6f8-62a87280b0c4', '7fad9cc7-de5d-4353-b82f-cf26eef9fece', '837fdd18-335d-4016-bb60-6a6a713a1e42', '84e19484-b9cd-4c5b-9cf3-8d9408eb09bd', '8634ae4b-69c0-4d18-af6a-ab04ab52f6cc', '8c54bf73-61df-4018-9971-91a3b919f47e', '9325e192-084a-4d92-bab0-05bbd66bde4c', '95b425bf-0039-4754-93dc-4102459667d5', '990c90be-f28f-48b8-b4fa-03fdd29013da', '9aaaf54b-c4e0-4c53-9406-11bd65b5e09b', '9b9de743-ccfe-40d6-b534-8ea4481b62fe', 'a6d818ec-5c36-4270-99ed-79f13229dc6a', 'a6e34885-3339-4c57-85b9-96befebe6350', 'b32aacd6-2d13-4969-9ef5-c2057e65fc5b', 'b3cf210b-ef65-46a8-999c-2a9472b7fb25', 'c5e42ed0-7c7e-4244-87ad-ff8ef545cb25', 'c6f7d1ab-716e-4dad-8f2f-42a1c9bd83dd', 'cf1df8a0-5e05-4434-b399-8d675a25f2b8', 'd23cf748-6afb-4a73-bee4-1a5b070b0799', 'd2b95db1-3f7f-4489-99f2-cdb2b76be940', 'd486e4ee-52fa-4bfa-8346-972ac32cdee9', 'da12a4e1-dabd-402e-b6a8-3f13c76556e5', 'daacc5ac-b74c-4790-88dd-3e695e8ebd59', 'db59db3d-5389-4378-859e-2b9e01be5904', 'dc24f0d5-3e81-4c55-b72e-c2436c7c54f2', 'de447f36-736b-44f6-af4d-bc4348b55adb', 'e1a3f02d-3e5d-4516-8db8-2a04c45988d0', 'e2ad6238-b480-4789-b952-a43801339416', 'e33aa28b-f718-47dc-bb02-2dbdc7261dc1', 'e3b82db7-7579-4bb8-bda5-9945bf6dabf1', 'ee2bb801-9c3a-40b5-91db-9b8d54768a7d', 'f01fcd15-006b-4c63-89e5-eacdc8d40342', 'f2da3756-2f18-4dd4-ac65-4dc24196aed8', 'f82861f8-4b20-4016-99b3-5cbc93034812', 'fc911cdd-dd2b-4d19-80af-1debba0d54dc']",Fractal: An advanced multidimensional range query lookup protocol on nested rings for distributed systems,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017

970,"To explain the large disparity between the potential and practice of interorganizational information systems (IOSs), this study investigates asymmetric information transparency in an IOS from a dyadic perspective. When there is asymmetric dependency in a dyad, an IOS may not completely eliminate asymmetric information transparency between supply chain (SC) partners but may change the nature of information asymmetry. Consistent with resource dependence theory, this study includes joint dependence and dependence asymmetry as antecedents of information transparency in an IOS. The data used in this study were collected from 111 matched pairs of intermediate component manufacturers and their immediate suppliers in heavy manufacturing industries. The results show that asymmetric information transparency in an IOS is prevalent in SC relationships. Regarding the antecedents of information transparency in an IOS, both joint dependence and each partner’s dependence advantage are significant. Furthermore, information transparency in an IOS positively influences SC performance measured by SC relationship quality and relationship-specific performance, whereas asymmetric information transparency negatively influences joint profit performance.","['B.

971,"Cone-copositive piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions (PWQ-LFs) for the stability analysis of continuous-time piecewise affine (PWA) systems are proposed. The state space is assumed to be partitioned into a finite number of convex, possibly unbounded, polyhedra. Preliminary conditions on PWQ functions for their sign in the polyhedra and continuity over the common boundaries are provided. The sign of each quadratic function is studied by means of cone-constrained matrix inequalities which are translated into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) via cone-copositivity. The continuity is guaranteed by adding equality constraints over the polyhedra intersections. An asymptotic stability result for PWA systems is then obtained by finding a continuous PWQ-LF through the solution of a set of constrained LMIs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by analyzing an opinion dynamics model and two saturating control systems.","['Raffaele Iervolino', 'Domenico Tangredi', 'Francesco Vasca']",7fca46a4-390a-4826-8e07-e984e65f04b4,0,"['250fa304-995d-4792-b132-ec32afc08762', '299978df-eb7b-4b5d-9dcb-6392b7efec29', '40205e8b-34f6-4e9f-8a67-911ea382298d', '53ed4ea5-2a7c-40cf-b794-f6b583b8a0dd', '747c9434-a43c-4b15-aa41-b01d54301af4', '8e53235e-3a08-4c8e-9aae-a0be271a8c48', '97c65b2b-1f2d-4920-bb98-c5577093a940', '97d40712-6924-411d-9d59-1ab566aeed9e', '9a572db9-5299-48b6-9d13-4d2ab97082fd', 'c0cca070-a100-4104-8717-b9c0c2246353', 'cfaa1df1-0b15-416b-9c6b-76502d0a9f16', 'daeabcb6-b553-4375-b8bc-00ea04747c66', 'f5cc0bac-2535-4dd5-ae5a-660692966e27']",Lyapunov stability for piecewise affine systems via cone-copositivity ☆,Automatica,2017
972,"AbstractThe problem of searching for burial sites is an important issue for criminology, history, and archeology. The presently employed classical ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methods often yield equivocal results. Here, we report the results of our experimental study on the possible enhancement of the GPR methodology by introduction of the neural network to help localize the places of deposition of cadavers. The experiments, employing pig bodies as a model, yielded very promising results, but also indicated the problems that must be taken into account in further development of the methodology. Such problems include the influence of several circumstances on GPR signal and its computer-aided interpretation. Particularly important are: 1) the progressive decomposition of the body; 2) the dressing on the body—none, summer or winter garment, or wrapped in shroud or plastic foil; and 3) the size of the body.

973,"In this work, a new patient-specific approach to enhance the spatial resolution of ECG is proposed and evaluated. The proposed model transforms a three-lead ECG into a standard twelve-lead ECG thereby enhancing its spatial resolution. The three leads used for prediction are obtained from the standard twelve-lead ECG. The proposed model takes advantage of the improved inter-lead correlation in wavelet domain. Since the model is patient-specific, it also selects the optimal predictor leads for a given patient using a lead selection algorithm. The lead selection algorithm is based on a new diagnostic similarity score which computes the diagnostic closeness between the original and the spatially enhanced leads. Standard closeness measures are used to assess the performance of the model. The similarity in diagnostic information between the original and the spatially enhanced leads are evaluated using various diagnostic measures. Repeatability and diagnosability are performed to quantify the applicability of the model. A comparison of the proposed model is performed with existing models that transform a subset of standard twelve-lead ECG into the standard twelve-lead ECG. From the analysis of the results, it is evident that the proposed model preserves diagnostic information better compared to other models.","['Jiss J. Nallikuzhy', 'S.

974,"The usual form to represent a point in a map is based in its geographical coordinates, establishing their relationship with other points in terms of distances and angles, usually azimuths. However, sometimes, the distance is not the most crucial factor when we want to represent certain relations. Thus, it may be important to represent jointly the travel time between two cities and the distances between them. In this representation greater distances are not always associated with longer times to drive. These maps, which also represents the time as a pseudo distance, would be useful for decision-making related to logistics management. This occurs in distribution logistics, where companies must meet delivery times, making prompt deliveries and timely deliveries. A software to perform comparative mapping from a source to a destination of distances and times between different geographical areas for road, rail and flight transport, would be useful for making decisions about what transport type should be used in order to minimize travel time between two points. This article shows method for joint representation of both magnitudes, which has been implemented in CHRONAS-MAP an initial version of software that implements this method in Spain.","['C.

975,"We report single-event transient (SET) responses of an on-chip linear voltage regulator in 130 nm commercial standard CMOS technology by heavy ion experiments at first. Responses can be distinguished by the load current. When the light load current was applied, the negative SET on the output of the regulator larger than 200 mV was not observed, while the positive SETs that are larger than 400 mV and last for about 200 ns were observed. By comparison, when the heavy load current was applied, both positive and negative SETs that are larger than 400 mV and last for several hundred ns were observed. Next, the mechanism behind the phenomenon is analysed and then verified by the post-layout SPICE circuit simulation. It is demonstrated that the input voltage, load current and the load capacitance are key elements in determining the severity of SET. Finally, the most sensitive node is located by analysis and SPICE circuit simulation, which lies in the output of the amplifier inside of the bandgap reference (BGR). This result is a primary consideration in the development of the hardening technique.","['QiFeng Zhao', 'GuoQing Yang', 'YongJie Sun', 'PeiFu Yu', 'Jianjun Chen', 'Bin Liang']",763f9967-d77a-4b83-b436-95bf8134a794,0,[],Research on the effect of single-event transient of an on-chip linear voltage regulator fabricated on 130 nm commercial CMOS technology,Microelectronics Reliability,2017

979,"Context: During its lifecycle, a software system undergoes repeated modifications to quickly fulfill new requirements, but its underlying design is not properly adjusted after each update. This leads to the emergence of bad smells. Refactoring provides a de facto behavior-preserving approach to eliminate these anomalies. However, manually determining and performing useful refactorings is a formidable challenge, as stated in the literature. Therefore, framing object-oriented automated refactoring as a search-based technique has been proposed. However, the literature shows that search-based refactoring of component-based software has not yet received proper attention.#R##N##R##N#Objective: This paper presents a genetic algorithm-based approach for the automated refactoring of component-based software. This approach consists of detecting component-relevant bad smells and eliminating these bad smells by searching for the best sequence of refactorings using a genetic algorithm.#R##N##R##N#Method: Our approach consists of four steps. The first step includes studying the literature related to component-relevant bad smells and formulating bad smell detection rules. The second step involves proposing a catalog of component-relevant refactorings. The third step consists of constructing a source code model by extracting facts from the source code of a component-based software. The final step seeks to identify the best sequence of refactorings to apply to reduce the presence of bad smells in the source code model using a genetic algorithm. The latter uses bad smell detection rules as a fitness function and the catalog of refactorings as a means to explore the search space.#R##N##R##N#Results: As a case study, we conducted experiments on an unbiased set of four real-world component-based applications. The results indicate that our approach is able to efficiently reduce the total number of bad smells by more than one half, which is an acceptable value compared to the recent literature. Moreover, we determined that our approach is also accurate in refactoring only components suffering from bad smells while leaving the remaining components untouched whenever possible. Furthermore, a statistical analysis shows that our genetic algorithm outperforms random search and local search in terms of efficiency and accuracy on almost all the systems investigated in this work.#R##N##R##N#Conclusion: This paper presents a search-based approach for the automated refactoring of component-based software. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to focus on component-based refactoring, whereas the state-of-the-art approaches focus only on object-oriented refactoring.","['Salim Kebir', 'Isabelle Borne', 'Djamel Meslati']",709b8a49-b1f3-47c5-b1a1-200ffb74fdfb,0,"['01dd3731-a2f1-48c5-865a-cd51edeb4a50', '01ec7aff-c4ea-4844-91fe-04e8009033bd', '0581f2c1-30ad-481f-b19c-191072d8f044', '0594803f-adb1-48c9-9833-4fa0c2b4a8b1', '0d6e0acc-83d6-4702-9e8a-15d4f87cf6bd', '17dc3b24-7314-4b0e-b0fc-93508fb569f4', '1a66c5d0-1b71-47ba-8a1f-70446489d248', '1baec5d0-8d4f-4c22-8276-97a1f01ea5ed', '24fa3a27-7dd8-4b8a-b9f7-58c4a48a0432', '28054697-fa44-4da8-a499-6fb511443c7c', '2ac9c583-01be-4487-b322-0a7f1ddcc01f', '3cfddf16-e372-438c-b646-f3ffdcf82471', '4061e35e-77bd-4c1e-b6ad-c8af83b193a7', '4107386e-b74a-401e-82ef-6c2ffed12c83', '47d88701-611f-4529-b897-52559e6358c1', '49000d1a-fce9-4651-831c-7c41e699b44f', '4a498f60-600b-4239-abf7-ecb1cd619c4b', '4efa290d-1b0c-4feb-bc47-40c60b3f15b6', '55e51d47-8e18-4db6-af60-30e4193e7aec', '63e16fd8-f25e-4e4b-8e42-615dcf993282', '649c09c3-ba3c-40ab-92c8-560d4bf96ebe', '664b1670-0a27-4fda-b309-d29fbf5a23dc', '6b8d6427-10cd-492c-800b-39ff14c6cc80', '7309fbf6-8796-4f96-bcd4-747555709bb6', '75c4d752-bbb6-4e04-aa1c-906f8ad78e71', '7abbee0f-b354-4715-8b55-ee4025ef94c6', '870db3d2-2156-455d-8d12-9902da9863b6', '8ef983f4-b7d2-4d12-ae84-ac43d9a3ada7', '943c6189-ccc9-4b2f-a1de-04ffdd2a2cd0', 'af4a6592-11b3-4585-a6ec-3480dfad0faf', 'b29b4e2d-337e-4c3c-8537-caf2735c682f', 'b57747b2-1637-4293-90f3-c65a9a4911eb', 'b7d0528e-c6ff-4ce3-a915-71820f790ca9', 'b9e8ee1d-cfe9-4d5a-a823-8a83c3abd0ff', 'bd75b0a6-1a0e-4f96-ade4-9d9e2afd4e23', 'c78b7362-b6f3-4e09-a7e0-3caff72317cf', 'd663982d-896d-48b6-915f-dab94673a302', 'd721ddc3-814a-4210-92cf-a51819258839', 'd81c23e0-a99d-4c58-92c3-8ea8a67d7b4a', 'e29b4669-6316-4bc3-b61d-a5be4ceec07c', 'e54af8f5-cb71-4a86-96eb-3ed4a5ef3bc4', 'fcf11b61-a2f4-4b64-9f77-f2e3d8177b15']",A genetic algorithm-based approach for automated refactoring of component-based software,Information & Software Technology,2017
980,"We study the problem of orienting the edges of a graph such that the minimum over all the vertices of the absolute difference between the outdegree and the indegree of a vertex is maximized. We call this minimum the imbalance of the orientation, i.e. the higher it gets, the more imbalanced the orientation is. The studied problem is denoted by \({{\mathrm{\textsc {MaxIm},},},},\). We first characterize graphs for which the optimal objective value of \({{\mathrm{\textsc {MaxIm},},},},\) is zero. Next we show that \({{\mathrm{\textsc {MaxIm},},},},\) is generally NP-hard and cannot be approximated within a ratio of \(\frac{1},{2},+\varepsilon \) for any constant \(\varepsilon >0\) in polynomial time unless \(\texttt {P},=\texttt {NP},\) even if the minimum degree of the graph \(\delta \) equals 2. Then we describe a polynomial-time approximation algorithm whose ratio is almost equal to \(\frac{1},{2},\). An exact polynomial-time algorithm is also derived for cacti. Finally, two mixed integer linear programming formulations are presented. Several valid inequalities are exhibited with the related separation algorithms. The performance of the strengthened formulations is assessed through several numerical experiments.","['Walid Ben-Ameur', 'Antoine Glorieux', 'José Neto']",c0e5f372-e6ef-4d68-90c3-c36b8b5fb7c1,0,"['0ca90fc3-b631-442d-8bed-7de0096b2766', '0e87661c-86f2-4e40-89c3-713f66bec09c', '53a4b999-6d33-4b5b-ac1f-b174a79c8d5e', '56203520-5571-405a-88d1-e666e19aea11', '72e8518a-b20d-421a-97df-a1e4383d9212', '93f723e7-8e17-4a24-be22-225551677bdc', '9a9104ef-1a64-4fb3-8901-6c77ac269cfd', 'acc87f3b-81cc-4727-a415-4de230c3e337', 'c3567bb4-9dbb-4b3b-a0d3-c0d2d7990839', 'e6adf5e2-3a53-43ba-bc7e-aed7528fbdfb', 'ecdc9a8c-9d2a-46c2-be36-184cb67e2ef4']",On the most imbalanced orientation of a graph,Journal of Combinatorial Optimization,2017

We propose a solution that is cost-aware, systematic, dependable while it accounts for performance unpredictability and volatility. To this end, we model the elasticity as a dynamically instantiated Markov decision process, which can be both solved and verified using probabilistic model checking. Further, we propose a range of complementary decision making policies, which are thoroughly evaluated in workloads from real traces. The evaluation provides strong insights into the trade-offs between performance and cost that our policies can achieve and prove that we can avoid both over- and under-provisioning.","['Athanasios Naskos', 'Anastasios Gounaris', 'Panagiotis Katsaros']",5b08bd19-f82b-4324-bf19-1ea237a7ae34,0,"['06469223-050f-475a-80ad-c4209d497508', '229371cb-ce94-4402-8dec-47b9c5c54882', '27cbc6fd-f7e7-4f2e-ab69-db4ad69fd303', '2ae9d173-9b83-4f7a-bff4-94c996f0c1a9', '2df37806-cb97-4f56-badf-8a715e864272', '30172199-c598-44d7-8e0b-1444abcc6c3e', '3a7b83c3-444d-43ae-8564-1bdb43314851', '434202ef-1b1a-46e9-9dd4-4a0310b35743', '44a4c0d8-bd54-421d-9206-dcf333a8fb27', '48420202-17e7-4b56-9c9b-3bcd992a12f0', '4ff3b033-2732-4404-9da3-5ba9bb5c0ffc', '50b736ae-9891-4520-8c43-3f96117b00d8', '50efa5f4-67f8-486b-9aa7-43e202a0bc2f', '56e0c5b6-6177-4157-8b18-196c0d00a476', '60a685d0-ceaa-46a4-a4be-d75502a9c196', '6af77130-4ec6-4da9-80cf-fcfa18d7ef21', '8457d456-65a1-4b01-8390-13e3a3da0c4b', '8b9260a0-6045-4735-bd1f-d75d79885164', '8dd42f4a-e117-423f-b087-7389210ee94e', '904ca75d-8539-4e68-bfda-04d89a4656ef', '9209c241-b066-4f71-b343-cda0659641e2', '950fe56e-3eed-429f-aab9-a8becb24e58c', '97340af9-5d1b-48ca-83e1-22bb8f2a3aa9', 'ade9cd6f-33e2-4f21-9078-61df94918cf2', 'b1d58908-b3d7-421e-a3ea-aa3356293993', 'b6d12712-fa05-42bc-bde9-145c3a587a53', 'b77c9f31-e087-4c78-bcfc-44c6205ecf54', 'bd38d048-757d-45df-acc3-92e7ff83cc85', 'c9b76326-0449-4cca-98f0-08217bc87c25', 'cd78d1e3-7417-4ef2-9070-b94bf58b2ed8', 'dc7d8157-b03d-4467-a661-360ef87869ee', 'eab24e98-3cf6-4807-a409-1fbfd5eeffa4', 'ee63f69a-a4a7-48dd-a679-14e01b14dc13', 'ee9b5e3a-e4fc-488b-b60a-6d011f12c319', 'f12746ad-cf49-455d-98f6-a8f35bef3bc3', 'f37a2286-5ed8-4985-b360-95163b5162ff', 'ff461fa6-b5ca-4a0f-98ad-851abc7f891d']",Cost-aware horizontal scaling of NoSQL databases using probabilistic model checking,Cluster Computing,2017

984,"This paper is concerned with the finite-horizon quantized   H ∞        H    ∞          filter design problem for a class of time-varying systems with quantization effects and event-triggered measurement transmissions. A componentwise event-triggered transmission strategy is put forward to reduce the unnecessary communication burden for the purpose of energy efficiency. The transmitted measurements triggered according to prespecified events are quantized by a logarithmic quantizer. Special attention is paid to the design of the filter such that a prescribed   H ∞        H    ∞          performance can be guaranteed over a given finite horizon in the presence of nonlinearities, quantization effects and event-triggered transmissions. Two sets of Riccati difference equations are introduced to ensure the   H ∞        H    ∞          estimation performance of the designed filter. The filter design algorithm is recursive and thus suitable for online computation.

985,"Named-Data Networking (NDN) is a promising architectural approach that focuses on the efficient distribution of data objects. Each of these objects represents an individual piece of content that is uniquely named and can be cached by network nodes. Recent work on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) explores new uses of the data object concept to enable advanced applications based on content distribution. Such work includes the use of metadata and manifests to describe contents as sets of multiple correlated objects. In this paper, we extend our previous work on a model and a backward-compatible mechanism, named NDNrel, that allows publishers to distribute contents as related objects. The new version of NDNrel reduces the cost of distributing relation information to clients by leveraging the usage of metadata and manifests on ICN architectures. Also, it considers additional aspects such as the authentication of relations and data that comprise the content. The evaluation of NDNrel is revisited and extended to analyze the performance and overhead caused by the usage of the proposed relation model in two scenarios: distribution of multimedia and Web content. Results demonstrate that using NDNrel to structure the contents as objects and relations outperforms default NDN, reducing the average client download time and the global network traffic in at least 28% and 34% respectively.","['Rodolfo Stoffel Antunes', 'Matheus B.

986,"Precise point positioning (PPP) is a well established Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technique that only requires information from the receiver (or rover) to obtain high-precision position coordinates. This is a very interesting and promising technique because eliminates the need for a reference station near the rover receiver or a network of reference stations, thus reducing the cost of a GNSS survey.#R##N##R##N#From a computational perspective, there are two ways to solve the system of observation equations produced by static PPP either in a single step (so-called batch adjustment) or with a sequential adjustment/filter. The results of each should be the same if they are both well implemented. However, if a sequential solution (that is, not only the final coordinates, but also those observed in previous GNSS epochs), is needed, as for convergence studies, finding a batch solution becomes a very time consuming task owing to the need for matrix inversion that accumulates with each consecutive epoch. This is not a problem for the filter solution, which uses information computed in the previous epoch for the solution of the current epoch. Thus filter implementations need extra considerations of user dynamics and parameter state variations between observation epochs with appropriate stochastic update parameter variances from epoch to epoch. These filtering considerations are not needed in batch adjustment, which makes it attractive.#R##N##R##N#The main objective of this research is to significantly reduce the computation time required to obtain sequential results using batch adjustment. The new method we implemented in the adjustment process led to a mean reduction in computational time by 45%.","['Ángel Martín Furones', 'Ana Belén Anquela Julián', 'Alejandro Dimas-Pages', 'Fernando Cos-Gayón']",54623670-e1ee-4e98-aba6-2f5a48b5e567,0,[],Computational time reduction for sequential batch solutions in GNSS precise point positioning technique,Computers & Geosciences,2017

Then, a double parameter rough membership degree of a fuzzy set is constructed based on variable precision multigranulation decision-theoretic fuzzy rough sets. A double parameter uncertainty measure of a multigranulation decision system is also proposed.

989,"One of the approaches to combinatorial optimization is to use global search methods, such as evolutionary algorithms combined with local search procedures. Local search can be very effective in improving the quality of solutions, however, searching large neighbourhoods can be computationally expensive. In this paper a new local search method is described that is dedicated to the Firefighter Problem (FFP). The Firefighter Problem concerns protecting nodes of a graph in order to stop a threat that is spreading in the graph. Because the resources used for protection are limited, the goal is to find the best order in which the nodes are protected and thus the FFP is a combinatorial optimization problem. One of the key elements in the design of a local search method is the definition of the neighbourhoods of solutions from which the local search starts. The method proposed in this paper (ED-LS) aims at lowering the computational cost of the local search by reducing, based on certain heuristics, the size of these neighbourhoods.#R##N##R##N#In this paper the ED-LS is compared to an optimization without the local search, a local search using non-reduced neighbourhoods and a method that reduces the neighbourhood by checking only some randomly selected neighbours. The results show that the ED-LS improves the performance of the algorithm with respect to no local search at all and to the local search using non-reduced neighbourhoods, supporting the view that reducing the size of the neighbourhood is beneficial. Also, the ED-LS produces better results than when the size of the neighbourhood is reduced randomly, which means that the proposed heuristics are indeed selecting promising neighbours effectively. In the last part of the experiments the ED-LS is further improved to obtain faster improvement of solutions at the beginning of the optimization run.",['Krzysztof Michalak'],4c20c7f6-aa78-48c2-a878-94c0744880b1,0,"['0056043e-4890-4037-9e70-58ad68ea4239', '01ec7aff-c4ea-4844-91fe-04e8009033bd', '0b1363e0-b6a4-4c99-8a2a-5f82850aee67', '1944f578-4e5e-4c71-aaa4-2d907381f2ae', '197733b6-3bf9-4622-886e-f83f9167a2d2', '19ce0f71-7319-4d9c-a391-fe4d397a7f63', '1afcfacc-e7ef-4e5a-a533-5959b1b225fa', '20360357-dd2c-4202-8477-090f35b37fc8', '2e443eac-4792-42ab-a292-980cd9b3991e', '2eca54ca-2df2-4c58-a1a3-3c494c115db8', '2fa4bdf3-82d5-45d5-b645-08abbecc7e7a', '352852bb-ae1d-415e-8371-fce658df2db5', '3c1205d7-a68d-4c37-8475-75c309753073', '3f7af90c-822c-4bea-b72e-37cad6f6623d', '43bdc072-09f2-4c48-a76e-5de20bdd97b8', '4b95012c-d524-43cc-a60d-7a6fda66d44a', '62c479df-2d62-4546-b85f-859ce0ff2979', '6557c0d9-befc-4956-8c23-9ea89610b811', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '67cc3d21-fb4a-46ba-be60-594949bd4a6c', '6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3', '70323e23-264f-4809-8745-919330810d4b', '7e37dc1a-78b3-4b66-85a0-8ced69808270', '82a5adb3-4f23-4501-a33f-4826a2af7b31', '871d7ecb-ffad-403d-8d5c-d770ee3d8290', '8e8cd955-6199-45aa-88ff-4a63909baa1d', '9376517f-51f1-4df6-a3c6-0a1d1cf18b02', '939c8a44-b15d-4bd8-b3f1-5c9c68b87a73', '94701028-4473-4ca6-bbee-d81e81256262', '9af7932b-56cf-44ac-a624-3dea5f14b068', '9ee4aa65-0e40-49bd-9196-1a7fdac7c018', '9f7f87c1-326d-42ea-9cc3-77ceae210259', '9f954d65-6ba1-4d47-8397-f541a0a20569', 'a4ac0934-e097-461d-be38-933dab120778', 'a62382a0-7b89-44c7-a32b-6497a35a5161', 'ae77b555-6883-4f4f-914b-0c90fa82b66a', 'b0cd5ec4-d29b-4757-ac0f-be7fc1b6d1c8', 'b5bdaccd-d49b-4be6-82d3-c1cfce8b8d2b', 'c671537d-db42-4349-9d69-9226bcc274ae', 'e3a3f132-da2e-4914-bded-96872c60f1c2', 'e4ed4352-88e6-4288-9bff-eea74a59f64f', 'e541893f-3f57-46ee-8164-b5e8e4538a74', 'eb2f4167-0a27-4f8f-bce4-0d1c55eb41c6', 'edbdefe0-08f4-4fbb-8051-7411cc1ec982', 'f66e38b7-9fd6-487a-9804-1d1cbcba7845', 'ff642753-709e-4d03-875a-9ba7b4c3960f']",ED-LS - A Heuristic Local Search for the Multiobjective Firefighter Problem,Applied Soft Computing,2017

While the advancement of women into high status roles offers them many organizational benefits, the spillover and crossover effects of these high status positions on their marital relationships remain under explored. In this study, we focus on potential costs to the marital relationship when women in high status positions hold higher job status roles than their husbands. First, we examine the spillover effects of wives’ job status relative to their husbands’ on marital instability. We suggest that this relationship is indirect and mediated by negative thoughts and feelings toward their partners’ lower job status (which we refer to as “wives’ status leakage”) and decreased relationship satisfaction.

993,"This paper examines the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS) model which is an intuitively straightforward extension of the intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) model. This concept which arises from IFSSs, is generalized by including a moderator’s opinion regarding the validity of the information at hand, thus making it highly suitable for use in decision-making problems that involve uncertain, vague and/or unreliable data. In this paper, we introduce the tools that measure the distance, similarity and the degree of fuzziness of GIFSSs. The axiomatic definitions of the distance measure is introduced and subsequently used to define the similarity measure and intuitionistic entropy induced by this distance measure. Some of the algebraic properties of these measures are also verified. The well-known Hamming, normalized Hamming, Euclidean and normalized Euclidean distances are generalized to make them compatible with the concept of GIFSSs. Subsequently, some relations among these information measures are proposed and verified. These results indicate how these measures are related and how they can be deduced from one another. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the information measure between GIFSSs by applying it to a case study related to the moderation of school-based assessment components of students in externally accredited academic programs.","['Ganeshsree Selvachandran', 'P.

994,"For each cancer type, only a few genes are informative. Due to the so-called ‘curse of dimensionality’ problem, the gene selection task remains a challenge. To overcome this problem, we propose a two-stage gene selection method called MRMR-COA-HS. In the first stage, the minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (MRMR) feature selection is used to select a subset of relevant genes. The selected genes are then fed into a wrapper setup that combines a new algorithm, COA-HS, using the support vector machine as a classifier. The method was applied to four microarray datasets, and the performance was assessed by the leave one out cross-validation method. Comparative performance assessment of the proposed method with other evolutionary algorithms suggested that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other methods in selecting a fewer number of genes while maintaining the highest classification accuracy. The functions of the selected genes were further investigated, and it was confirmed that the selected genes are biologically relevant to each cancer type.","['V. Elyasigomari', 'David A.

995,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that leads to a loss of cognitive functioning, affecting older people as well as their families. Although a few treatments are available to slow down the progress of the disease, they are limited in effectiveness and should start at an early stage of the disease. Since an early diagnosis of AD is crucial, to maximize treatment effectiveness and prepare the families for the worsening of symptoms, researchers are studying biomarkers and Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. Hence, this manuscript proposes a new methodology to obtain an efficient CAD system by relying on [\(^{18},\)F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) scans, while taking into account the longitudinal information of a subject. The CAD system tries to identify regions of interest by simultaneously segmenting all the FDG-PET scans acquired over time for each subject and combining the segmentation result to find the most coherent information for all the subjects. Experimental results show that the proposed CAD system outperforms a state-of-the-art approach, either when only relying on baseline scans or in the follow-up classification, achieving, for instance, more than 82.0% accuracy in the discrimination between AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Finally, in a multi-class classification task, the proposed CAD system attains 59.0% accuracy at baseline and goes up to 69.4% in the follow-up.","['Helena Aidos', 'Ana L. N.

996,"This paper presents a simple equal gain combining technique for cyclostationarity detection based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. The presented technique is based on maximum cyclic autocorrelation function (MCAS) technique with a low computational cost relative to other cyclostationarity detection based spectrum sensing techniques. MCAS judges whether an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal is included in received signals, by comparing the peak and non-peak values of a cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF). In this paper, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the CAF, which is composed of the peak and non-peak values of the CAF, is employed. The presented technique attempts to improve the performance of spectrum sensing by combining CAFs obtained at each receive antenna and by obtaining a stable CAF SNR. Moreover, the presented technique is implemented on a software defined radio based testbed for the evaluation. The developed testbed is mainly composed of a Universal Software Radio Peripheral/GNU Radio which is one of the software defined radio receiver, and the spectrum sensing technique is experimentally demonstrated in an anechoic chamber using the 470–710 MHz frequency band allocated to ISDB-T (terrestrial digital broadcasting) in Japan. The effectiveness of the presented techniques is validated by these results.","['Shusuke Narieda', 'Tetsuya Hada']",0d75b594-5a55-427a-b9a4-b02d620a43db,0,"['3850f86b-04fa-42e0-a438-c4c730790f6f', '78b8b798-4575-4c4f-aee3-488a90eaaffa', '89dd3ade-85e7-4086-af05-ba9428428279', '98460879-3b95-46c0-921b-b5f0ece0bd9a', 'b31aff3f-1f76-4e7d-abe6-ceb80efb6979', 'c9bf7b9c-eef4-483a-aafe-6daf5e7d4f65', 'd4c4c5b0-bf09-4211-93e5-c250522f0fc8', 'ea4d1511-d2f0-4c92-b9a3-81d78e8ac20f', 'f99adb37-1509-4180-a178-820c251d7661', 'fd00f148-e4d5-49f9-bfd6-07f841d8f101']",Signal Cyclostationarity Detection Based Spectrum Sensing Using Simple Diversity Combining Technique and Its Implementation,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
997,"A dual-mode controlled dc–dc controller with power over Ethernet (PoE) interface for power device (PD) is presented that is designed to support drawing power either from an Ethernet cable or from an external auxiliary supply support (ASS). PoE interface supports all the functions that comply with the IEEE802.3af/at standard. Based on bandgap reference structure, a detection comparator is provided to detect input voltage without extra voltage reference. Using a low offset voltage amplifier, a low-loss current-limiting technique is proposed to achieve a high-precision current-limit point. Based on a high-speed comparator and two timing capacitors, an oscillator (OSC) is implemented for better accuracy, and provides the maximum duty cycle (   $D_{\mathrm {max},},$   ) and external frequency synchronization. The chip is fabricated in a 0.5-   $\mu \text{m},$    65 V BCD process and occupies a die size (with pads) of    $1.79 \times 2.76$    mm 2 . The experimental results are measured for an active clamp forward converter with a wide range of dc input voltages from 33 to 57 V, an output voltage of 12 V, and an output power of 30 W. The chip achieves peak power efficiency of 90% and 90.63% on DC and ASS, respectively. The load regulation at different input voltages can be measured to be within ±0.11%. Measurements further show that the peak-to-peak ripple voltage of the chip is 161 mV and the recovery time is less than 1.2 ms for the 2-A load step.","['Yongyuan Li', 'Zhangming Zhu']",5405018e-cddc-440c-a23c-8b25901ea0b8,0,"['019d2de8-c77f-4025-9a7f-ca330078c469', '0957ec7e-b179-4cf2-87e3-a30597a56e44', '15b1b544-ded5-479a-a66f-172a1ef08d9e', '342b779f-0a9f-40c1-b2a4-0567c1fd9f98', '489e0588-c18c-4b3e-b47a-6120fdb276e8', '72b26fa6-f648-48fa-8da9-2725c9a6a886', '8e1bbfc0-321d-4a60-8272-0a604aa1a25a', 'a9843b88-2b11-46eb-840c-0ea1c5feb01b', 'b254d804-18b4-4d58-9f07-60ca76ecb805', 'c637ccfc-b3c9-4dca-8f77-3cf6342c6018', 'd1a1afd5-e64e-489a-beb1-f8298eac73ee', 'ec02ef36-0047-4a1f-8872-ffd754e5e5d9', 'f1594d3d-9994-42cb-86d9-bebe4a17b005']",A 30-W 90% Efficiency Dual-Mode Controlled DC–DC Controller With Power Over Ethernet Interface for Power Device,IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems,2017
998,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, a non-fragile observer-based output feedback control problem for the polytopic uncertain system under distributed model predictive control (MPC) approach is discussed. By decomposing the global system into some subsystems, the computation complexity is reduced, so it follows that the online designing time can be saved.Moreover, an observer-based output feedback control algorithm is proposed in the framework of distributed MPC to deal with the difficulties in obtaining the states measurements. In this way, the presented observer-based output-feedback MPC strategy is more flexible and applicable in practice than the traditional state-feedback one. What is more, the non-fragility of the controller has been taken into consideration in favour of increasing the robustness of the polytopic uncertain system. After that, a sufficient stability criterion is presented by using Lyapunov-like functional approach, meanwhile, the corresponding control law and the upper bound of the quadratic cost ...","['Kaiqun Zhu', 'Yan Song', 'Sunjie Zhang', 'Zhaozhun Zhong']",6f0ed2f5-30fc-4fac-838e-b92a21981269,0,"['163197db-5aad-44cc-ac43-982c850e7ba7', '1dfddb0a-c28f-4852-af75-d6c8f3c971a4', '235994f5-492a-4416-8446-dc9a7edcd443', '3e9da526-177b-4458-b959-10e8037b2583', '4090179a-3c8b-4748-8b9c-ee536b81770a', '99f9f3dc-6da7-4664-97d4-4eaee2cbb053', '9c6a7c95-7477-4a4d-95a4-4e103f061075', '9d7b806e-0a33-4fa8-a1a8-0d1efe903c41', 'a76aa943-b44f-4125-8ade-441ec3c9023f', 'a9ddc5bd-2bac-4ae5-ab28-c3f9be0aade3', 'c2529918-2291-43fe-91be-0c348846165d', 'd5c10f26-5179-44d6-b627-79b7086c592b', 'e0d7caa9-ec8a-49f6-9cd8-36c77e409bbb', 'ea9d5aed-d4fe-464a-8458-bb97f136b924', 'f19fd09f-7beb-4dd0-9330-f7a4be12a0b6', 'f7dbb575-48fa-4645-b0d0-fc188aa45119']",Non-fragile observer-based output feedback control for polytopic uncertain system under distributed model predictive control approach,International Journal of Systems Science,2017

1000,"When integrating computational tools such as automatic segmentation into clinical practice, it is of utmost importance to be able to assess the level of accuracy on new data, and in particular, to detect when an automatic method fails. However, this is difficult to achieve due to absence of ground truth. Segmentation accuracy on clinical data might be different from what is found through cross-validation because validation data is often used during incremental method development, which can lead to overfitting and unrealistic performance expectations. Before deployment, performance is quantified using different metrics, for which the predicted segmentation is compared to a reference segmentation, often obtained manually by an expert. But little is known about the real performance after deployment when a reference is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reverse classification accuracy (RCA) as a framework for predicting the performance of a segmentation method on new data. In RCA we take the predicted segmentation from a new image to train a reverse classifier which is evaluated on a set of reference images with available ground truth. The hypothesis is that if the predicted segmentation is of good quality, then the reverse classifier will perform well on at least some of the reference images. We validate our approach on multi-organ segmentation with different classifiers and segmentation methods. Our results indicate that it is indeed possible to predict the quality of individual segmentations, in the absence of ground truth. Thus, RCA is ideal for integration into automatic processing pipelines in clinical routine and as part of large-scale image analysis studies.","['Vanya V.

1001,"Many problems in medicine are inherently dynamic processes which include the aspect of change over time, such as childhood development, aging, and disease progression. From medical images, numerous geometric structures can be extracted with various representations, such as landmarks, point clouds, curves, and surfaces. Different sources of geometry may characterize different aspects of the anatomy, such as fiber tracts from DTI and subcortical shapes from structural MRI, and therefore require a modeling scheme which can include various shape representations in any combination. In this paper, we present a geodesic regression model in the large deformation (LDDMM) framework applicable to multi-object complexes in a variety of shape representations. Our model decouples the deformation parameters from the specific shape representations, allowing the complexity of the model to reflect the nature of the shape changes, rather than the sampling of the data. As a consequence, the sparse representation of diffeomorphic flow allows for the straightforward embedding of a variety of geometry in different combinations, which all contribute towards the estimation of a single deformation of the ambient space. Additionally, the sparse representation along with the geodesic constraint results in a compact statistical model of shape change by a small number of parameters defined by the user. Experimental validation on multi-object complexes demonstrate robust model estimation across a variety of parameter settings. We further demonstrate the utility of our method to support the analysis of derived shape features, such as volume, and explore shape model extrapolation.

1002,"Wireless sensor networks are being used as the enabling technology that helps to support the development of new applications and services targeting the domain of healthcare, in particular, regarding data collection for continuous health monitoring of patients or to help physicians in their diagnosis and further treatment assessment. Therefore, due to the critical nature of both medical data and medical applications, such networks have to satisfy demanding quality of service requirements. Despite the efforts made in the last few years to develop quality of service mechanisms targeting wireless sensor networks and its wide range of applications, the network deployment scenario can severely restrict the network's ability to provide the required performance. Furthermore, the impact of such environments on the network performance is hard to predict and manage due to its random nature. In this way, network planning and management, in complex environments like general or step-down hospital units, is a problem still looking for a solution. In such context, this paper presents a smart context-aware quality of service based admission control method to help engineers, network administrators, and healthcare professionals managing and supervising the admission of new patients to biomedical wireless sensor networks. The proposed method was tested in a small sized hospital. In view of the results achieved during the experiments, the proposed admission control method demonstrated its ability, not only to control the admission of new patients to the biomedical wireless sensor network, but also to find the best location to admit the new patients within the network. By placing the new sensor nodes on the most favourable locations, this method is able to select the network topology in view of mitigating the quality of service provided by the network.","['Carlos Abreu', 'Francisco Miranda', 'P.

1004,"In this paper, we aim a novel algorithm called robust Lp-norm least squares support vector regression (Lp-LSSVR) that is more robust than the traditional least squares support vector regression(LS-SVR). Using the absolute constraint and the Lp-norm regularization term, our Lp-LSSVR performs robust against outliers. Moreover, though the optimization problem is non-convex, the sparse solution of Lp-norm and the lower bonds for nonzero components technique ensure useful features selected by Lp-LSSVR, and it helps to find the local optimum of our Lp-LSSVR. Experimental results show that although Lp-LSSVR is more robust than least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and much faster than Lp-norm support vector regression (Lp-SVR) and SVR due to its equality constraint, it is slower than LS-SVR and L1-norm support vector regression (L1-SVR), it is as effective as Lp-SVR, L1-SVR, LS-SVR and SVR in both feature selection and regression.","['Y.

1008,"The architecture of dual connectivity (DC) allows each user’s equipment to simultaneously communicate with a macro and a small cell via two different radio-interfaces. User association (UA) with DC is considerably more challenging than traditional single one, because each user must be associated with the best combination of serving macro cell and small cell. This paper focuses on DC architecture and proposes an efficient DC-enabled UA approach to maximize the overall system throughput for downlink wireless heterogeneous network (HetNet). In this approach, we formulate it as a non-linear and integer optimization problem in a sum-of-ratios form. Since the formulated problem is non-deterministic polynomial hard (NP-hard), it is challenging to achieve its optimal solutions. To this end, this problem is relaxed and then transformed into a tractable form, which can be solved iteratively to obtain its solution. Numerical results show that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed algorithm can enhance system throughput and improve offloading performance of small cells.","['Youwei Shi', 'Hua Qu', 'Jihong Zhao']",8efde139-25b8-4a30-8ad5-ef7b2938b89c,0,"['05be4906-481d-4114-89a1-6cec9b9ea079', '16b4ef3a-2b5d-4d6b-b53b-702cca242f61', '442280ae-8f07-46a3-9a4b-50e700eb1bf4', '52f02ca0-2dc5-42c7-a19f-2987c748c475', '7673a477-dabe-4a8e-b971-f625718904d8', '88a0c275-1fce-4f12-a40b-2472b871811e', '9ce95fce-061c-47ec-82d6-e48e0fe54981', 'a5cbda8d-a0cd-4f54-964e-f18103e0517c', 'bc3c0796-4703-417a-a8d5-165982be1356', 'ec9cff16-c1d9-4bfe-82c7-6cfb61da7b32', 'eedc05c6-c9d4-439e-aecd-ac4b99f235aa']",Dual Connectivity Enabled User Association Approach for Max-Throughput in the Downlink Heterogeneous Network,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
1009,"Automated ultrasonic signal classification systems are finding increasing use in many applications for the recognition of large volumes of inspection signals. Wavelet transform is a well-known signal processing technique in fault signal diagnosis system. Most of the proposed approaches have mainly used low-level handcraft features based on wavelet transform to encode the information for different defect classes. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning based framework to classify ultrasonic signals from carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) specimens with void and delamination. In our proposed algorithm, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to learn a compact and effective representation for each signal from wavelet coefficients. To yield superior results, we proposed to use a linear SVM top layer in the training process of signal classification task. The experimental results demonstrated the excellent performance of our proposed algorithm against the classical classifier with manually generated attributes. In addition, a post processing scheme is developed to interpret the classifier outputs with a C-scan imaging process and visualize the locations of defects using a 3D model representation.","['Min Meng', 'Yiting Jacqueline Chua', 'Erwin M.

1013,"We present a new approach for predicting permeability of natural rocks using thin sections. Our approach involves two steps: (1) computing permeability of the thin sections for flow normal to the face, and (2) application of new robust 2D-3D transforms that relate thin section permeability to 3D rock permeability using calibration parameters. We perform step 1 using Lattice-Boltzmann and finite difference schemes, which are memory efficient. We discuss two models to perform step 2. Our two-step approach is fast and efficient, since it does not require reconstruction of the unknown 3D rock using 2D thin section information. We establish the applicability of this new approach using a dataset comprised of LBM-computed permeability of rock samples from various geologic formations, including Fontainebleau sandstone, Berea sandstone, Bituminous sand, and Grosmont carbonate. We find that for sandstones our approach predicts fairly accurate permeability with little calibration. Predicting permeability of carbonates from thin sections is more challenging due to microstructural complexity thus model parameters require more calibration. For general workflow, we propose to first calibrate the proposed models using the available 3D information on the rock microstructure (from microCT, SEM, etc.) and then predict the permeability for rocks from the same geological formation for which only 2D thin sections are available.","['Nishank Saxena', 'Gary Mavko', 'Ronny Hofmann', 'Nattavadee Srisutthiyakorn']",e75c295f-57b0-4187-a5e3-2cd375ad1918,0,"['996a9481-dce3-43ef-9d0e-da67912ea09a', 'ab59be76-4e2b-45fe-8e0a-ae8868d58d5a']",Estimating permeability from thin sections without reconstruction: Digital rock study of 3D properties from 2D images,Computers & Geosciences,2017

The objective of this research is to evaluate OntoSoft for organizing the metadata associated with a data pre-processing software workflow used in association with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model. This is accomplished by exploring what metadata are available from online resources and how this metadata aligns with the OntoSoft Ontology.

1015,"Abstract#R##N##R##N#In Math Program 55(1992), 129–168, Conforti and Rao conjectured that every balanced bipartite graph contains an edge that is not the unique chord of a cycle. We prove this conjecture for balanced bipartite graphs that do not contain a cycle of length 4 (also known as linear balanced bipartite graphs), and for balanced bipartite graphs whose maximum degree is at most 3. We in fact obtain results for more general classes, namely linear balanceable and subcubic balanceable graphs. Additionally, we prove that cubic balanced graphs contain a pair of twins, a result that was conjectured by Morris, Spiga, and Webb in ( Discrete Math 310(2010), 3228–3235).","['Pierre Aboulker', 'Marko Radovanović', 'Nicolas Trotignon', 'Théophile Trunck', 'Kristina Vušković']",a3a89924-de31-4de4-a082-d4d709e8d122,7,"['0fa824e3-cb8f-466c-a11f-9edfe6e14435', '1a13bf3c-83ff-4994-a0a9-db7a73ca832f', '50b4ebef-abdc-4cab-8d4f-d332f7730dbe', '6ea5a471-9e61-4cae-bab9-98e1920f958f', '7e4f71a7-9503-4752-94f0-244685618e0a', '9479a2ed-1cef-49e4-bf30-3c1b089609be', '958e02b3-74ca-47ef-a561-16a9b183dc20', '9986f18f-e64b-4d7c-b278-1bb49b24f918', 'd86a11df-95bd-4238-ace1-f57627f5af22', 'e192771a-c62e-42f3-b3b4-2092d65bc042', 'f1593148-9383-481b-a0cc-adf7d6fcfabe']",Linear balanceable and subcubic balanceable graphs,Journal of Graph Theory,2014
1016,"Hot-spot parking is becoming the Achilles' heel of the tourism industry. The more tourists that are attracted to the scenic site, the more often they will encounter a hassle of congestion to find a parking place; while those existing facilities for daily traffic are not supposed to support the excessive volume outburst. In this paper, we present a new parking guidance information system (PGI). By taking advantage of the technical advances of today in wireless communication of vehicular ad-hoc network, each vehicle will request and obtain a relatively fair opportunity to park. The competition and the corresponding allocation on the available slots emerging along the time scale are considered, in order to ensure that no vehicle enters a state of starvation. This is the first attempt to solve the spatiotemporal problem of resource assignment based on our extensive work on the Hungarian algorithm. The contribution as one part of the sustainable development of big historic cities is to minimize the idle driving and waiting, without increasing the parking supply, which could be costly and unnecessary to build in those urban areas. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate the success of our effort, in terms of the average cruising/waiting time in each individual parking case and its upper bound. The data is compared with the best results known to date and shows a new direction to improve the resource assignment.","['Peng Liu', 'Biao Xu', 'Guojun Dai', 'Zhen Jiang', 'Jie Wu']",015c0c34-a179-4cec-a51d-7ffb798f70c4,0,"['09a6da96-862f-4acb-b17b-facb29a3acbc', '383f344d-aeb8-47dc-b007-2154c98a4373', '395d15c8-1b89-4f21-b634-f027bb7f6e48', '4b523e10-a17a-4c64-9f22-057cb340bd76', '55659a56-4d2c-4057-acdb-0386ad2c7c38', '579bfe8b-aa3c-4ddd-bc7d-7670063c3b6b', '626673fb-e5b6-4281-85d9-b8531b156e1b', '69ebf2d6-8afd-4738-873d-54208493ed26', '7b40c1b1-10d4-4876-8409-391955b89174', '7fd58dd4-9566-4a6e-9e79-2df8af9cced2', '97fcae90-632e-45fe-ab79-f869fa2a6aec', 'a20a5441-3710-4dd6-9e96-96f6dcfe984c', 'a40e1aeb-4601-48bb-9435-6add9ad16ba2', 'd9e66871-ff1b-4320-a64c-7e1583bc135f', 'f0159154-df7a-4a4a-bc59-de1aa4f91ec7']",MDP: Minimum Delay Hot-spot Parking,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017

The focus is on the variational formulation associated with Neumann type constraints and its numerical approximations. We establish the well-posedness for some variational problems associated and study their local limit as  δ  → 0. A main contribution is to derive a second order convergence to the local limit. We then discuss the numerical approximations including standard finite element methods and quadrature based finite difference methods.

1018,"This work is concerned with feature screening for linear model with multivariate responses and ultrahigh dimensional covariates. Instead of utilizing the correlation between every response and covariate, the linear space spanned by the multivariate responses is considered in this paper. Based on the projection theory, each covariate is projected on the linear space spanned by the multivariate responses, and a new screening procedure called projection screening (PS) is proposed. The sure screening and ranking consistency properties are established under some regular conditions. To solve some difficulties in marginally feature screening for linear model and enhance the screening performance of the proposed procedure, an iterative projection screening (IPS) procedure is constructed. The finite sample properties of the proposed procedure are assessed by Monte Carlo simulation studies and a real-life data example is analysed.","['Xingxiang Li', 'Guosheng Cheng', 'Liming Wang', 'Peng Lai', 'Fengli Song']",8dd97a68-eb0d-49db-927b-e94cc759953d,0,"['4af1c339-18c1-458c-adb4-f7f3814688d2', 'b1e230fb-61e2-4927-b592-404783dabdc6', 'c30c6ec0-f644-4eea-abed-15f6a01530b9', 'd6885294-7c99-43e1-82c5-09f2898ca877']",Ultrahigh dimensional feature screening via projection,Computational Statistics & Data Analysis,2017
1019,"Goal : In computational biology, selecting a small subset of informative genes from microarray data continues to be a challenge due to the presence of thousands of genes. This paper aims at quantifying the dependence between gene expression data and the response variables and to identifying a subset of the most informative genes using a fast and scalable multivariate algorithm.  Methods : A novel algorithm for feature selection from gene expression data was developed. The algorithm was based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion HSIC, and was partly motivated by singular value decomposition SVD.  Results : The algorithm is computationally fast and scalable to large datasets. Moreover, it can be applied to problems with any type of response variables including, biclass, multiclass, and continuous response variables. The performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy, stability of the selected genes, speed, and scalability was evaluated using both synthetic and real-world datasets. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm effectively and efficiently extracted stable genes with high predictive capability, in particular for datasets with multiclass response variables.  Conclusion/Significance : The proposed method does not require the whole microarray dataset to be stored in memory, and thus can easily be scaled to large datasets. This capability is an important attribute in big data analytics, where data can be large and massively distributed.","['Mehrdad J.

We assessed spatial knowledge acquisition in male and female participants using a technology not previously examined empirically: the digital fulldome. Our primary aim was to examine whether performance on a test of survey knowledge was better in a fulldome (N = 28, 12 males) relative to a large, flat screen display (N = 27, 13 males). Regression analysis showed that, compared to a flat screen display, males showed higher levels of performance on a test of survey knowledge after learning in the fulldome, but no benefit occurred for females. Furthermore, performance correlated with spatial visualization ability in male participants, but not in female participants. Thus, the digital fulldome is a potentially useful learning aid, capable of accommodating multiple users, but individual differences and use of strategy need to be considered.","['Craig Hedge', 'Ruth Weaver', 'Simone Schnall']",2ca1bafb-b932-4d58-9b37-491001db820a,0,"['047fe850-883a-4db6-a045-94fb73b6a612', '12ca68a4-d1a1-474f-b885-2affcf0795d9', '1d88dd8f-168f-4fc3-88ce-3980fe1ded86', '2782efe7-7128-43cd-b9b3-89af9220b3d1', '4f973293-ee8a-4f8e-82dd-194c61570d2e', '83a24717-c1d8-4e8b-9367-d613e610496d', '9c426c05-ad28-40d9-9a0b-01a470484681', 'a923979e-95c8-4613-905a-828a8ede916f', 'be89ba54-8c0d-4152-b8c4-90520f0695d1', 'c7807bb2-6f2b-471d-aa55-c52d5ff5b3db', 'ff7cb49a-ffb8-45fa-9780-55f52351faf3']",Spatial Learning and Wayfinding in an Immersive Environment: The Digital Fulldome,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",2017

1022,"For decades, information technology has been posited to have a major impact on firm performance. Investigations into this line of inquiry have almost always used constructs related to individual firm performance as their dependent measures, an approach that made sense under historical economic conditions. In recent years, however, value chains are giving way to digital supply networks with electronic interactions between tiers in the flow of goods and services. Such an environment makes it imperative to develop sophisticated measures of the performance of entire networks of firms, as opposed to individual firm performance.   Using game-theoretic concepts, this paper explores several dimensions of networked organizational performance as a construct, as a set of measures, and as a construct within a nomology. It describes a program of research in which some empirical validation has already been completed and other work is now underway. We first validate measures for a dyadic view of network performance, followed by an n-firm perspective.","['Detmar W.

1023,"A Markov chain with memory is no different from the conventional Markov chain on the product state space. Such a Markovianization, however, increases the dimensionality exponentially. Instead, Markov chain with memory can naturally be represented as a tensor, whence the transitions of the state distribution and the memory distribution can be characterized by specially defined tensor products. In this context, the progression of a Markov chain can be interpreted as variants of power-like iterations moving toward the limiting probability distributions. What is not clear is the makeup of the “second dominant eigenvalue” that affects the convergence rate of the iteration, if the method converges at all. Casting the power method as a fixed-point iteration, this paper examines the local behavior of the nonlinear map and identifies the cause of convergence or divergence. As an application, it is found that there exists an open set of irreducible and aperiodic transition probability tensors where the Z-eigenvector type power iteration fails to converge.","['Sheng-Jhih Wu', 'Moody T.

1024,"Soil contamination by heavy metals has been an increasingly severe threat to nature environment and human health. Efficiently investigation of contamination status is essential to soil protection and remediation. Visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS) has been regarded as an alternative for monitoring soil contamination by heavy metals. Generally, the entire VNIR spectral bands are employed to estimate heavy metal concentration, which lacks interpretability and requires much calculation. In this study, 74 soil samples were collected from Hunan Province, China and their reflectance spectra were used to estimate zinc (Zn) concentration in soil. Organic matter and clay minerals have strong adsorption for Zn in soil. Spectral bands associated with organic matter and clay minerals were used for estimation with genetic algorithm based partial least square regression (GA-PLSR). The entire VNIR spectral bands, the bands associated with organic matter and the bands associated with clay minerals were incorporated as comparisons. Root mean square error of prediction, residual prediction deviation, and coefficient of determination (R2) for the model developed using combined bands of organic matter and clay minerals were 329.65 mg kg−1, 1.96 and 0.73, which is better than 341.88 mg kg−1, 1.89 and 0.71 for the entire VNIR spectral bands, 492.65 mg kg−1, 1.31 and 0.40 for the organic matter, and 430.26 mg kg−1, 1.50 and 0.54 for the clay minerals. Additionally, in consideration of atmospheric water vapor absorption in field spectra measurement, combined bands of organic matter and absorption around 2200 nm were used for estimation and achieved high prediction accuracy with R2 reached 0.640. The results indicate huge potential of soil reflectance spectroscopy in estimating Zn concentrations in soil.","['Weichao Sun', 'Xia Zhang']",6c9a0cfa-f179-4d20-b7bf-6e4a0059d6f2,0,[],Estimating soil zinc concentrations using reflectance spectroscopy,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2017

In general, virtual teams desire richer media to improve team interaction. However, in this case more information may not be helpful. Drawing on Objective Self Awareness theory in social psychology and theories of cognitive overload from communication, hypotheses are proposed concerning how viewing oneself influences virtual team interaction. It is argued that viewing oneself will lead to lower team performance and other negative outcomes. The hypotheses are tested in a laboratory experiment, manipulating whether participants were able to view their own feeds during video-mediated communication. The results suggest that viewing oneself leads to a reduction in team performance and individual satisfaction.

The basic idea of this method is to subdivide a control volume (main cell) into several sub-cells and the finite volume method is applied to each of the sub-cells. The average values on the sub-cells belonging to current and face neighboring main cells are used to reconstruct a common polynomial distribution of a dependent variable on current main cell. This method can achieve high order accuracy using a compact stencil. The focus of this paper is to study the performance of the sub-cell finite volume method on two-dimensional unstructured quadrilateral grids and to verify that high order accuracy can be achieved using face neighboring sub-cells only. Fourier analysis is performed to analyze the dispersion and dissipation properties of the two-dimensional sub-cell finite volume schemes. To capture the discontinuities, the paper proposes a cell-based multi-dimensional limiting procedure using only face-neighboring main cells. Several benchmark test cases are simulated to validate the proposed sub-cell finite volume schemes and the multi-dimensional limiting procedure.","['Jianhua Pan', 'Yu-Xin Ren', 'Yutao Sun']",f531ba35-5758-45e6-aca2-62dd8c8a81d6,0,"['08368021-a37d-4688-8479-074275e136c0', '143d83f8-d88d-454f-ab2a-3b80627333ce', '16dd68e5-f612-432d-91d5-bd690096ddcb', '3cfb3c5e-a6a0-4c55-99fa-b26377f4ab63', '468c13ce-892e-47bb-a4af-fefec83f20ab', '4d0c552e-2d88-468c-8c25-6b9d67e839b7', '5643c930-ca34-4b88-b761-03b6dbbc1d13', '569d3a19-7221-44ab-8f82-69a7d5edc3b9', '5aa1fa2c-24fd-4130-ba47-bd309296cdbf', '693c7383-60a8-4bfb-a7ce-0b92571b5e7a', '6d44d12f-607e-4447-95c6-aa208be5ff2e', '73b5d67b-5c3c-425a-9992-e43f9d16c3c6', '7bf7b13b-a153-4234-a500-fdbbbfe6f3f7', '81624a71-96e7-4aa6-abaa-f0ca5c416642', '9292b70a-d915-4acc-ab01-2d083d196bfa', '9bbf1184-6011-4f95-b9b4-60215e15af97', 'a587f7b0-8be7-4aab-9168-89654dd1ef8e', 'a8612352-6634-4c5c-bc8e-57491b3b4781', 'ae716e6d-22d1-426d-9416-82c5cc04e528', 'b5b6ef40-013f-4984-b235-bd1dd49e654a', 'c78bcb15-7efb-4331-b605-60aeeea92244', 'd20453ab-54ce-4141-9f79-cb33a0b5c7ba', 'd8c512c1-f6ba-4bcc-b6a7-463365b7997e', 'e7293afd-c79c-47d7-9b2b-105bead83b9d']",High order sub-cell finite volume schemes for solving hyperbolic conservation laws II: Extension to two-dimensional systems on unstructured grids,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
1027,"ABSTRACTIn this paper, the problems of full-order and reduced-order positive state estimations are developed for discrete-time positive Markov jump linear systems with delay. By establishing a positive time-delay system for 1-moment function of the state vector, delay-dependent necessary and sufficient exponential stability conditions are first derived based on a comparison technique for positive systems. Then, on the basis of the derived stability conditions, the problems of designing positive state observers in full-order and reduced-order for positive Markov jump systems with delay are addressed. The existence conditions of positive observers and the design schemes are formulated in terms of linear programming problems which can be effectively solved by various optimisation algorithms to obtain the observer parameters. Finally, three numerical examples with simulations are given to validate the analysis and design results.",['Le Van Hien'],d8e58014-6144-4a25-9e78-e31603d9d1d0,0,"['1cf2f953-060d-493b-85b7-f4ef79d25998', '1ece4c82-b76c-41b6-9dc0-2ff286043ba5', '3be10e4b-7f8e-407f-a23f-e95a6c5b2fe7', '4f337ef6-df32-4ecb-8705-b9f1f0521213', '59e1be06-12c9-402d-89b5-56e7d61bd2a2', '72d6f188-bd37-4b93-92d0-5f843ef7b2ec', '766ab65a-4f52-40d9-92ca-39befde62b2a', '7a363504-09f5-4a26-bfc4-f8428deb4ada', '89de32c5-ea25-4f3b-801d-f0c2841ca089', '997aa847-d727-4386-b938-3b15e0483ff3', 'bbb0a074-95be-4573-b73d-96d05002d368', 'c4cee14a-675e-4219-a623-a55924a376ef', 'd6b7b5f8-4556-48ed-b2b8-31a47c7aeac7', 'e013aaa0-cc4f-46c5-9b15-cd1d301afdf5', 'f757c0ad-6452-4ff6-b16a-0f35c429c76a']",An LP approach to full-order and reduced-order state estimations of positive Markov jump systems with delay,International Journal of Systems Science,2017
1028,"Geo-distributed Datacenter Cloud is an effective solution to store, process and transfer the big data produced by Internet-of-Things (IoT). A key challenge in this distributed system is how to allocate the bandwidth resources among these geo-distributed datacenters of this cloud efficiently. This paper aims to address this challenge by optimizing the transfer bandwidth resources among different geo-distributed datacenters. To this end, we firstly analyze the interaction between the traffic of physical networks and the data flow of Geo-distributed Datacenter Clouds, and then establish a game theory-based model for cloud resource allocation. Based on this model, a dynamic resource allocation strategy and its corresponding algorithm that are adaptable to the Internet conditions are proposed. Since the background traffic, capacity limit of physical networks as well as the flows and resource demands of geo-distributed datacenters are taken into account, this new strategy can achieve the load balance of the physical networks and content transferring among different geo-distributed datacenters effectively. The real-world trace data is adopted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed resource allocation strategy. Compared with existing strategies, the evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed strategy can balance the workloads of physical networks, reduce the response delay of cloud applications, and possess an excellent adaptability.","['Xiaoqun Yuan', 'Geyong Min', 'Laurence T.

1029,"Strong equivalence is an important concept in the theory of answer set programming. Informally speaking, two sets of rules are strongly equivalent if they have the same meaning in any context. Equilibrium logic was used to prove that sets of rules expressed as propositional formulas are strongly equivalent if and only if they are equivalent in the logic of here-and-there. We extend this line of work to formulas with infinitely long conjunctions and disjunctions, show that the infinitary logic of here-and-there characterizes strong equivalence of infinitary formulas, and give an axiomatization of that logic. This is useful because of the relationship between infinitary formulas and logic programs with local variables.","['Amelia Harrison', 'Vladimir Lifschitz', 'David Pearce', 'Agustín Valverde']",c4c06641-6ca5-4e5a-8a1d-818b7ece8811,0,"['2a3c2b83-9ba9-494b-98f5-d071ea5e5493', '6d7f2581-37f1-4f5b-b637-f4b0e655f783', '7cd2dc8f-ff2e-4421-bde0-dc4a805269d6', '8637112d-cb8e-4c41-aa41-7b7e39188b86', 'bcb2a694-1be7-498f-96b4-1b02878c9e8e', 'be84debc-4554-4ded-b264-db5222a06525', 'db658327-1f48-4f80-8f7d-09d88096f297', 'ddf0c406-71c1-429d-ad65-be14274c3784', 'e22908da-10e5-49ec-93ed-2d7b1e1e8da3', 'f0dc246d-3ef9-4500-ba5d-7c823d7ca6ca', 'f1b5a146-3d5f-4be1-aea7-3b1ab576c5a7', 'f760fc28-67a1-4c80-bccf-18489d19a59f', 'fa8d6eeb-2a97-41a6-9eab-7739229cb772']",Infinitary equilibrium logic and strongly equivalent logic programs,Artificial Intelligence,2017
1030,"Abstract  Objectives  To characterize the electronic health record (EHR) systems in use in an affluent region of India in order to understand the state-of-the-art within the Indian market.  Methods  A survey on EHR features was created by combining an instrument developed by the Organisation for International Cooperation and Development and an instrument developed by an American team of researchers. An interviewer directly administered the survey to leaders from hospitals in greater Chandigarh which possessed electronic health information systems. Summary statistics from the survey are reported.  Results  24 hospitals offering multi-specialty inpatient care were identified in greater Chandigarh. 18 of these hospitals had electronic health information systems, 17 of which were interviewed. Of the hospitals with systems, 17 (100%) could access patient demographic information internally, but 12 (71%) could not access vital sign, allergy, or immunization data internally. 11 (65%) of the systems were capable of sharing patient summaries internally, but 13 (76%) could not send electronic referrals internally. Among organizations which have adopted systems, major barriers tend to have been around financial and staff matters. Concerns over interoperability, privacy, and security were infrequently cited as barriers to adoption.  Conclusions  EHRs are ubiquitous in at least one region of India. Systems are more likely to have capabilities for intra-organizational information sharing than for inter-organizational information sharing. The availability of EHR data may foster clinical research.","['Adam C. Powell', 'Jasmine K.

1031,"Software product lines (SPL) aim at reducing time-to-market and increasing software quality through extensive, planned reuse of artifacts. An essential activity in SPL is variability management, i.e., defining and managing commonality and variability among member products. Due to the large scale and complexity of today's software-intensive systems, variability management has become increasingly complex to conduct. Accordingly, tool support for variability management has been gathering increasing momentum over the last few years and can be considered a key success factor for developing and maintaining SPLs. While several studies have already been conducted on variability management, none of these analyzed the available tool support in detail. In this work, we report on a survey in which we analyzed 37 existing variability management tools identified using a systematic literature review to understand the tools’ characteristics, maturity, and the challenges in the field. We conclude that while most studies on variability management tools provide a good motivation and description of the research context and challenges, they often lack empirical data to support their claims and findings. It was also found that quality attributes important for the practical use of tools such as usability, integration, scalability, and performance were out of scope for most studies.","['Rabih Bashroush', 'Muhammad Garba', 'Rick Rabiser', 'Iris Groher', 'Goetz Botterweck']",e826ac11-0bd3-4a37-86a7-147b462513f6,0,"['0504e06c-eede-4b9b-9900-72e764484938', '0d97fc4c-6f64-4eea-9425-4625ffe410c5', '10ec69bf-7453-48e0-b3fb-47f481f05960', '19a839aa-1e0f-4462-96ed-54faa0c28d37', '1dff0894-ca58-42de-bad8-955da57632d3', '1ffe0dd6-50b6-4ac3-94a4-e383e727440a', '20de82d6-d917-4324-a801-41287f8a205b', '25ee1fe9-2bb6-4b96-aeec-09fd60aaf710', '30bc88d3-846f-47ff-9364-c198c454dd0d', '31c718af-0d4e-4649-8af7-c74643a3c001', '3993c94e-10e2-4d68-a43a-4010b4b4dce4', '43d010aa-d0a2-466e-abc2-f76853e2af01', '44074cca-3c83-40e7-a418-b7602b3a462e', '492dcbb7-af2e-4074-af5a-05da5c21968f', '4a3d69b2-2702-4790-b839-05eace5672e4', '4be1d4d9-da91-4918-9d36-f447d12cd660', '50a85db5-ac25-4caa-abaf-f3ceb1b63e17', '52514005-6173-41c6-b78a-bea36e89b67b', '56ef35fe-6afe-425e-b39c-78a12067c95f', '5a200149-4731-4408-b764-82c1fc37c0a6', '5e0491f5-f11f-49eb-bd29-ba43698bfbc0', '5e4fb4d9-efea-4ef7-81e6-9d31e5aeb5ed', '637a94e2-41ab-4081-9d13-98b48e6e5465', '64153bc0-0c3a-4c5d-be93-b0f29bafc84f', '65c50e53-abf9-4511-8eae-9eddbdd3f819', '6ccad5ba-39df-4937-8f32-af8671441850', '7028ecb1-5129-4c19-a681-e3da475cc91a', '70e432df-1e59-49c2-80ce-0e83ee9fa6be', '74214b91-7f77-4262-8eaa-4eb1154eeb56', '7677c4d2-bb47-4ec9-b230-e447a73d7ddf', '7747c948-d981-4390-a1b6-ecd9970d4889', '8842db59-61ad-4398-937e-88954ecc609e', '9021870f-c22f-4961-a5c6-2cb506604b41', '906ca4b6-2c92-4658-9214-a85cdfe2e9bb', '972086a5-ab8a-4c1b-b5ef-46bc73e64d26', '98b37492-5330-462c-8a69-0001eb890e93', '98b664c2-08a2-446f-9096-ef7d2c680be8', '99769a2b-407b-4ce0-aeec-81bcce5bafb7', '9dcea7b6-2db9-4a58-a67e-1a7ae1206e7a', '9df2099f-539c-4166-9f4d-cacda8b117d1', 'a22b2d59-c3b0-4c74-b237-ce4d9e347cf0', 'a2bda22f-3df9-4cdf-b649-04e8fcc933fb', 'a5df26ca-fa37-4e16-831f-c417d9435180', 'a7ca53af-246b-48f2-aaa1-fb85e3627b58', 'a7dbcebb-0995-4900-8a47-3cfa3f19181c', 'ac4fb5af-37c2-4356-9b61-44825c6bf1f5', 'ac9eee4f-7802-4c9d-9b83-b2970985bedc', 'ad532971-20de-4fe6-9000-939159fc47fd', 'b49529ac-fe5e-41c7-92da-3a16285d67d4', 'b7d0528e-c6ff-4ce3-a915-71820f790ca9', 'b993df73-9aa0-4bf1-8dbc-ab70540a6eb3', 'bc1cd3fe-d831-4ac9-b42a-c20a10fc1289', 'bd59a8fa-df50-43b2-9923-21408eb19bb6', 'c28a4738-232e-45da-8343-13190cc5e0ed', 'c4b70f3f-a8f0-4474-9bb0-b8274dd21194', 'c5dcee3e-4c32-40f8-baa6-d1369de40c5b', 'c9cf5470-888a-434e-85a6-e27c79094a92', 'ca76cf8f-d013-4dc6-b016-c991eee67260', 'cc6a6a44-67bf-4633-9adb-1e399db3be48', 'cdb12323-f7b7-4010-9a47-22bd39bf3bcf', 'd86ada5c-ea59-4692-bc34-67df93547b20', 'd8ff14c7-1a1b-433d-a27d-9bce2c5a8604', 'd959427a-c8e4-419f-ae9c-a2370a63e635', 'dc0a1c00-9eac-4fcc-aab5-1f7dc73333be', 'de2f70c2-5ce1-4416-8e21-1994505bbd5a', 'e015409c-0810-486d-b5f7-b186d1b705bd', 'e2495276-5948-4048-a01c-e68ba13f9347', 'e28a72bc-f552-483a-81f6-47ac83c19e13', 'e716a48f-8a3e-416d-afee-270906727cb9', 'ea1ad010-4789-403d-b2b5-e18b08a531a1', 'f07cd234-3c39-486d-9468-6c31a3db2464', 'f15ccc93-1688-410a-9a59-727adedbbde9', 'f63120fa-408b-42f8-99ef-d767c4e238b7']",CASE Tool Support for Variability Management in Software Product Lines,ACM Computing Surveys,2017
1032,"In order to investigate the stress and strain distributions caused by the grain anisotropy of polycrystalline β-Sn, a finite-element (FE) analysis was conducted using a polycrystalline model that considers the effect of grain anisotropy on the elastic and plastic properties. Even in the case of thermal free expansion with a temperature change of 75 °C, plastic strains can be generated locally in polycrystalline β-Sn. This might be due to the high anisotropy of the thermal expansion coefficient and the low yield strength of β-Sn. It was found that both in-phase and out-of-phase thermal stresses can be present in the polycrystalline β-Sn simultaneously. The highest stress and strain appeared in the grains whose orientation is relatively different from those of neighboring grains, near the grain boundaries. This might cause the formation of a grain boundary void in the Pb-free solder. Comparing the strain distribution due to the thermal expansion coefficient anisotropy and the Young's modulus anisotropy, it was determined that the maximum value of the plastic strain due to the thermal expansion coefficient anisotropy is approximately 10% higher than that due to the anisotropy of Young's modulus, and the high strain areas are also different in the two cases.

Studies on the asynchronous dynamics of BANs have mainly focused on monotonic networks, where fundamental questions on the links relating their static and dynamical properties have been raised and addressed. This paper explores analogous questions on non-monotonic networks, ⊕-BANs (xor-BANs), that are BANs where all the local transition functions are ⊕-functions. Using algorithmic tools, we give a general characterisation of the asynchronous transition graphs of most of the strongly connected ⊕-BANs and cactus ⊕-BANs. As an illustration of these results, we provide a complete description of the asynchronous dynamics of two particular structures of ⊕-BANs, namely ⊕-Flowers and ⊕-Cycle Chains. This work also draws new behavioural equivalences between BANs, using rewriting rules on their graph description.","['Aurore Alcolei', 'Kévin Perrot', 'Sylvain Sené']",73f6dab7-0d66-45d5-bb48-aaec4d4f2079,0,"['2162e05a-b2f4-400a-97d7-c7ab28fcf823', '26cf6743-b304-4fba-a669-aacdd47e4c4a', '3bf53aca-74af-486b-a6c2-639cca9e0878', '48becdd5-1d17-4214-9e0d-a73236c7a8be', '48c4d4e3-a23a-466a-a538-fbc12deb1302', '89183060-1db2-43fc-a1a4-69c73f07e6ec', '8bb2ee47-8409-4a0b-97b6-51fea3dfa155', 'b6bb2865-ed5b-4024-824e-94669e0bcc34', 'c5c84fe0-1c49-4cda-96b5-712778b6ebc7', 'cfb11eff-ee58-4932-8f6f-5b5049b26832', 'd739fd23-5648-4b8d-847c-e31601c0086c', 'e8491040-9f5e-4790-9394-4644171b688b', 'f7db755c-a4ea-4a0d-bf90-8a884baf65c4']",On the Flora of Asynchronous Locally Non-monotonic Boolean Automata Networks,Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science,2016

Based on this representation, we propose a unified Gauss–Jordan elimination procedure for the computation of all types of generalized inverses related to the {1},-inverse. Complexity analysis indicates that when applied to compute the Moore–Penrose inverse, our method is more efficient than the existing Gauss–Jordan elimination methods in the literature for a large class of problems.

1035,"Abstract  Objectives  Mobile technology supporting text messaging interventions (TMIs) continues to evolve, presenting challenges for researchers and healthcare professionals who need to choose software solutions to best meet their program needs. The objective of this review was to systematically identify and compare text messaging platforms and to summarize their advantages and disadvantages as described in peer-reviewed literature.  Methods  A scoping review was conducted using four steps: 1) identify currently available platforms through online searches and in mHealth repositories; 2) expand evaluation criteria of an mHealth mobile messaging toolkit and integrate prior user experiences as researchers; 3) evaluate each platform's functions and features based on the expanded criteria and a vendor survey; and 4) assess the documentation of platform use in the peer-review literature. Platforms meeting inclusion criteria were assessed independently by three reviewers and discussed until consensus was reached. The PRISMA guidelines were followed to report findings.  Results  Of the 1041 potentially relevant search results, 27 platforms met inclusion criteria. Most were excluded because they were not platforms (e.g., guides, toolkits, reports, or SMS gateways). Of the 27 platforms, only 12 were identified in existing mHealth repositories, 10 from Google searches, while five were found in both. The expanded evaluation criteria included 22 items. Results indicate no uniform presentation of platform features and functions, often making these difficult to discern. Fourteen of the platforms were reported as open source, 10 focused on health care and 16 were tailored to meet needs of low resource settings (not mutually exclusive). Fifteen platforms had do-it-yourself setup (programming not required) while the remainder required coding/programming skills or setups could be built to specification by the vendor. Frequently described features included data security and access to the platform via cloud-based systems. Pay structures and reported targeted end-users varied. Peer-reviewed publications listed only 6 of the 27 platforms across 21 publications. The majority of these articles reported the name of the platform used but did not describe advantages or disadvantages.  Conclusions  Searching for and comparing mHealth platforms for TMIs remains a challenge. The results of this review can serve as a resource for researchers and healthcare professionals wanting to integrate TMIs into health interventions. Steps to identify, compare and assess advantages and disadvantages are outlined for consideration. Expanded evaluation criteria can be used by future researchers. Continued and more comprehensive platform tools should be integrated into mHealth repositories. Detailed descriptions of platform advantages and disadvantages are needed when mHealth researchers publish findings to expand the body of research on TMI tools for healthcare. Standardized descriptions and features are recommended for vendor sites.","['Sarah J. Iribarren', 'William Brown', 'Rebecca Giguere', 'Patricia W.

1036,"According to the “No Free Lunch (NFL)” theorem, there is no single optimization algorithm to solve every problem effectively and efficiently. Different algorithms possess capabilities for solving different types of optimization problems. It is difficult to predict the best algorithm for every optimization problem. However, the ensemble of different optimization algorithms could be a potential solution and more efficient than using one single algorithm for solving complex problems. Inspired by this, we propose an ensemble of different particle swarm optimization algorithms called the ensemble particle swarm optimizer (EPSO) to solve real-parameter optimization problems. In each generation, a self-adaptive scheme is employed to identify the top algorithms by learning from their previous experiences in generating promising solutions. Consequently, the best-performing algorithm can be determined adaptively for each generation and assigned to individuals in the population. The performance of the proposed ensemble particle swarm optimization algorithm is evaluated using the CEC2005 real-parameter optimization benchmark problems and compared with each individual algorithm and other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms to show the superiority of the proposed ensemble particle swarm optimization (EPSO) algorithm.","['Nandar Lynn', 'Ponnuthurai N.

1037,"Carrier aggregation (CA) is an important feature of next generation cellular networks to meet the growing demand for wireless broadband services from fast-growing mobile users. This also facilitates the efficient use of fragmented spectrum among users of varying data rates. However, this does bring in a number of new implementation challenges, among which energy efficiency along with ensuring coverage and capacity fairness for users becomes the fundamental challenge for such systems. This paper initially analyses the outage capacity of such systems for both intra- and inter-band CA. Then, relaying is proposed as an energy efficient technique for enhancing the capacity and coverage of such systems. In this context, the ergodic rate of a typical user is analysed for both single- and multi-flow relay assisted CA systems. Different band deployment configurations are also analysed and compared. Further, it is observed that relays can be utilised to boost the capacity of lower frequency component carriers ensuring better capacity fairness among the users.","['Ashish James', 'A. S.

Examples are presented to show that, in general, the identifiability of ALPV model parameterizations does not guarantee the identifiability of the LTI parameterizations composed of frozen LTI models. A new sufficient and necessary condition is then introduced in order to guarantee the structural identifiability for ALPV parameterizations. The identifiability of this class of parameterizations is related to the lack of state–space isomorphisms between any two models corresponding to different parameter values. In addition, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for local structural identifiability, and a sufficient condition for (global) structural identifiability which are both based on the rank of a user-defined matrix. These latter conditions allow systematic verification of identifiability. Numerical examples are finally presented to illustrate our results.","['Ziad Alkhoury', 'Mihaly Petreczky', 'Guillaume Mercère']",bd092366-0000-4365-923e-1e27fbba0919,50,"['02ff11b4-5f7f-4c87-8160-d7b123fb375a', '19cfc103-202a-4e2a-8042-c5627c796b24', '3219627b-9f7b-45a5-a25d-92be18efbcfc', '52255938-d89d-4d87-bc0e-78755a62288b', '52a7be7e-4ba5-4f3b-be21-71ef037c801f', '5e70d470-a5d3-4e71-a1b3-aa7308ff9e17', 'dbc4f266-e63b-418c-91f2-27c1bd132e7e', 'e49b9050-f5a3-4568-a193-9e3d376d105a', 'e8f96b30-11fe-41a7-9a00-52de8177db2b']",Identifiability of affine linear parameter-varying models,Automatica,2017
1039,"This paper presents an extensive study on the application of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm for load frequency control (LFC) in multi-area power system with multiple interconnected generators. The LFC model incorporates various possible physical constraints and non-linearities such as generation rate constraint, time delay, dead zone and boiler. The ABC algorithm is used to find the optimum PID controller parameters. The tuning performance of the algorithm is comparatively investigated against different optimization technique such as evolutionary programming (EP), genetic algorithm (GA), gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The robustness analysis of the system is also evaluated by investigating the dynamic response of the controller with load demand at varying time step, tuning based on different performance criterion and by varying the load demand. The performance of the system is evaluated based on the settling time and maximum overshoot value of the frequency deviation response. The performance of ABC is also verified against an exhaustive search based on interval halving method. Despite employing a single controller for multiple interconnected generators, the optimized controller is able to successfully damp oscillations in the system response and regulate the area control error back to zero in minimal amount of time. The results indicate the superiority of the ABC algorithm’s search mechanism in finding the optimum set of PID controller’s gain.","['K. Naidu', 'Hazlie Mokhlis', 'A.H.A.

1040,"In this paper we investigate supervisor synthesis for a multi-agent system, which consists of an indefinite number of agents, all instantiated from a given agent template via corresponding language isomorphisms. We call such a system a multi-agent system with similar actions, as their individual alphabets are isomorphic to each other. Each agent shares a common global alphabet with other agents, but their private alphabets are disjoint. All local requirements are also instantiated from a given requirement template. We formulate a control protocol synthesis problem, which assumes that each private alphabet is only observable to the corresponding agent, but the global alphabet is accessible by all agents. Our goal is to compute a control protocol (i.e., a supervisor template) whose instantiations associated with individual agents ensure a controllable, nonblocking and requirement-satisfying behavior of the system, regardless of the total number of constituent agents. A solution to this problem will make the desirable plug-and-play control strategy feasible. We show that the existence of a solution is decidable, and a solution is computable when the answer to the decision problem is positive. To overcome the synthesis complexity, a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm is provided.","['Rong Su', 'Bengt Lennartson']",cfc790a7-848a-4eb2-a181-45c652433338,0,"['0859e067-1035-49d2-989a-f0416a764169', '0bb4ec48-0290-4bb4-8f1b-c5f9189e8ecb', '13b2ba5c-99e0-458f-868e-3bf462b7fdf3', '223edc15-f2f7-4796-8b91-9fab63eda279', '4e7a90a5-8134-4e22-8422-b6ccd17b8e1b', '4ec8006e-8f9b-4b15-8a26-9982e5b169ab', '6c5e4da2-f3d7-475c-954b-fb3381b8d8df', '7e6b0f5b-2839-45b1-bc55-b3a588026207', '8b5cbfe1-af66-47cf-9f84-c47c7f7a9a7d', '90eaa14d-93fd-4de3-b7f8-b0236fa61dbe', 'ad4100ff-d8b8-4c5b-8696-f9de9d51e3cf', 'b0f6455a-6f99-42c5-8502-4fa535768ceb', 'd36a4a0e-e91b-4749-948d-2105787e9e1b', 'e6aa4a68-b079-49cc-8929-8812b5b7241c', 'f81f8af2-23ab-4f1d-8212-9f105cf3b6a8', 'f831d13a-1cfb-4eb3-9be2-872ece2866fc']",Control protocol synthesis for multi-agent systems with similar actions instantiated from agent and requirement templates,Automatica,2017
1041,"A sampling-based approximate query processing (AQP) method provides a fast way for users to obtain a trade-off between accuracy and time consumption by executing the query on a sample of data rather than the whole dataset. There are two major AQP methods: the (1) central limit theorem (CLT)-based online aggregation; and the (2) bootstrap method. The former is very efficient but is only suitable for simple aggregation queries, while the latter is quite general but has relatively high computational overhead. Both methods suffer from the possible estimation failure. However, there is no technology that can both support simple/complex queries within an acceptable time coupled with carefully considering the estimation failure. To make the current AQP method much more general and efficient, we propose a hybrid approximate query framework called AQP++ to combine the advantages of both methods and eliminate the limitations as far as possible. According to this hybrid framework, an estimation parameters adjustment method is presented for CLT-based online aggregation to improve its usability for much more complex aggregation queries. Then, an execution cost model is proposed to describe the computational overhead of the two AQP methods, which can be used to support our dynamic scheduling mechanism of AQP++ and make the whole system more efficient and flexible. Moreover, we have implemented our AQP++ prototype and conducted extensive experiments on the TPC-H benchmark for skewed data distribution. Our results demonstrate that our AQP++ can produce acceptable approximate results for both simple and complex queries within a much shorter time compared with the original CLT-based online aggregation and bootstrap method.","['Yuxiang Wang', 'Yixing Xia', 'Qiming Fang', 'Xiaoliang Xu']",49074b66-fdea-46eb-ac3f-b676913d65a9,0,"['01c92637-18cc-4d81-8a61-8c53e14ec3ec', '06415a77-4b99-4551-8d88-ea2f561235b6', '0d647328-1ac4-420a-b18e-db0a20411406', '14fd8bdf-c2e1-4a38-9701-dfb984559d26', '15d9bbf7-b878-48c0-a0c2-9b57a6600586', '17b4089a-edad-4f10-a8ff-3049d22a6858', '196c8df0-91ad-4340-a9c9-faee3f753113', '314f2cc3-1dc6-4453-8d32-3ce37bddfb46', '3679a571-cc8e-48a8-94cb-645b4e58eff5', '37343724-6121-4bc3-b48d-88f42756f56b', '648df804-3479-4af8-ad35-bd1dd9474bf5', '69b2a275-1a10-4fd7-ad92-c3c827ad3592', '6dc59e62-296f-48c2-af94-886f0b6d9ab9', '6dcc84a0-b80c-4d76-a8e6-5bb0e177035a', '70f6b425-f8f0-45e3-a53c-9314e6264611', '7c35ba4b-ddb8-4b1b-9c35-9b3a7d892abc', '83a7ba1a-6639-4245-973a-d31ba58352d2', '91a8fb60-5c1e-4702-8ee4-c2718d37411d', '961ba695-28b0-4fdf-8148-89dfd2a822c5', 'a5869e96-f2e5-48d7-940f-3ae9a819354e', 'c73ac22d-dd42-4f6b-9ec3-a8806326c989', 'e5fb9615-102c-475a-ad12-18b4315fb84d', 'e76c1f90-e7c9-4ee2-b8be-b3058c34dc2f', 'e8a77008-ab15-4988-a544-deb18d534072', 'f1042ba7-7142-4dce-bc9e-82244233e139', 'f97cf703-cc04-477b-99e9-ca378e748c7d', 'fb0a382c-a1f1-4f0c-8e80-36fe5fbbfb86']",AQP++: A Hybrid Approximate Query Processing Framework for Generalized Aggregation Queries,Journal of Computational Science,2017

Here we present the first open-source implementation of the URF concept for ring perception. The C library RingDecomposerLib is easy to use, portable, well-documented, and thoroughly tested. Aside from the URFs, other related ring topology descriptions like the relevant cycles (RCs), relevant cycle prototypes (RCPs), and a smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) can be calculated. We demonstrate the runtime efficiency of the RingDecomposerLib with computing time benchmarks for the complete PubChem Compound Database and thereby show the applicability in large-scale and interactive applications.","['Florian Flachsenberg', 'Niek Andresen', 'Matthias Rarey']",64090acc-e101-4ff5-8746-cf48bc1118c0,0,"['06970b43-cca8-44e3-8ce4-c7e771eb334e', '297e7da5-81a2-4220-896c-450aa089d297', '3d256c69-108c-4536-b204-2d79433d43b4', '5a542372-67e1-4ed3-b65f-bb629bf433fe', '8ec42db8-93cb-4c9b-a8b5-616c7b04e7c7', '9b34b922-e4bc-41c0-8991-e74127a6edd3', 'd8b2e792-9791-4812-9b64-0b3dae497327', 'f78b953f-96fb-4554-af85-2086accecde5']",RingDecomposerLib: An Open-Source Implementation of Unique Ring Families and Other Cycle Bases,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,2017
1043,"Multi-view registration is a fundamental but challenging task in 3D reconstruction and robot vision. Although the original motion averaging algorithm has been introduced as an effective means to solve the multi-view registration problem, it does not consider the reliability and accuracy of each relative motion. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel motion averaging algorithm for multi-view registration. Firstly, it utilizes the pair-wise registration algorithm to estimate the relative motion and overlapping percentage of each scan pair with a certain degree of overlap. With the overlapping percentage available, it views the overlapping percentage as the corresponding weight of each scan pair and proposes the weighted motion averaging algorithm, which can pay more attention to reliable and accurate relative motions. By treating each relative motion distinctively, more accurate registration can be achieved by applying the weighted motion averaging to multi-view range scans. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness and efficiency.","['Rui Guo', 'Jihua Zhu', 'Yaochen Li', 'Dapeng Chen', 'Zhongyu Li', 'Yongqin Zhang']",87d56618-13e4-4a7f-ac9c-d854b37c22eb,0,"['0383a4eb-ac17-4e82-977d-82729dea13d5', '078a174b-6bf3-4009-9951-0ee8d1cb27b4', '08c0136b-8c13-4b33-ac8f-623602a0b4d4', '0e1f74fc-3615-4808-b932-8f8ceab1b0fa', '2826a7b3-c07f-4404-8da3-11681479bb1b', '2b8c5cfb-750a-40af-8aa5-947193ad3826', '3ede8779-0a00-44de-b4f2-71705ada5a49', '4ae093d8-9359-4783-86a6-c279afe38a21', '50f67f82-42e0-42cf-a595-edb2242abd32', '56cf250a-fe5c-47ca-bb72-5848edda128d', '5d00938e-ef75-471f-ac62-8d0e8fee5371', '61d57302-6af2-413a-8fa2-1b940cdde1a5', '65c4b5a2-291a-45fa-902f-7404c4fe3537', '694977fa-2855-4e22-825b-64be17e23a3d', '796077e0-6875-48a8-8915-ded0c17fd3be', '80f98543-85a6-4e74-8a91-d930bd543a4f', '9bc55a3a-592e-4d25-b677-cd303b928aed', 'a084dc6d-e73e-42d8-a5a6-6ca0110e6663', 'a7a01782-8e14-4dd6-9336-60718abbfc0b', 'ae2402ad-123c-4f7b-a0b1-6085d5e85f60', 'b6384e77-1e53-4943-a091-0a2600d94f3c', 'ba4f1f0c-eae2-49aa-bc19-c6076608b101', 'c694af6f-b809-4f7f-b74d-75267c6e62bd', 'd636c4d0-6854-4bbb-9fbd-245a9201f24c', 'dae0bcfd-10a0-4631-9ac7-682324b72130', 'e510c34e-2802-46b6-9100-da8491fa7d52']",Weighted Motion Averaging for the Registration of Multi-View Range Scans,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2017
1044,"Recent advances in physical layer technologies, allows simultaneous reception of multiple packets by a node. This promising technology is called Multi-Packet Reception (MPR). In this paper, we analyze a modified IEEE 802.11 DCF based medium access control (MAC) protocol for Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) with nodes having MPR capability. Our protocol modifies the backoff mechanism of the IEEE 802.11 DCF so that the backoff process quickly adapts to the prevailing traffic conditions while leveraging MPR. A Markov chain model for the backoff process of the nodes with MPR capability has been derived. Further a Markov chain model to capture the state of the MPR channel has been derived. Solving the Markov chains for stationary probabilities, we derive the saturated throughput and energy efficiency of our protocol. Effect of the number of nodes, MPR capability, contention window size, and sensing errors on the saturation throughput has been investigated. Proposed analytical model has been validated through extensive simulations. Our investigation has the potential to aid in the development of next generation WLAN MAC protocol.","['I. B. Arun', 'T. G.

1045,"An accurate detection of preterm labor and the risk of preterm delivery before 37 weeks of gestational age is crucial to increase the chance of survival rate for both mother and the infant. Thus, the uterine contractions measured using uterine electromyogram (EMG) or electro hysterogram (EHG) need to have high sensitivity in the detection of true preterm labor signs. However, visual observation and manual interpretation of EHG signals at the time of emergency situation may lead to errors. Therefore, the employment of computer-based approaches can assist in fast and accurate detection during the emergency situation. This work proposes a novel algorithm using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) combined with wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), for automated prediction of pregnant women going to have premature delivery by using uterine EMG signals. The EMD is performed up to 11 levels on the normal and preterm EHG signals to obtain the different intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). These IMFs are further subjected to 6 levels of WPD and from the obtained coefficients, eight different features are extracted. From these extracted features, only the significant features are selected using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method and selected features are ranked by Bhattacharyya technique. All the ranked features are fed to support vector machine (SVM) classifier for automated differentiation and achieved an accuracy of 96.25%, sensitivity of 95.08%, and specificity of 97.33% using only ten EHG signal features. Our proposed algorithm can be used in gynecology departments of hospitals to predict the preterm or normal delivery of pregnant women.","['U. Rajendra Acharya', 'Vidya K.

1046,"Rather than merely dealing with robot localization and mapping in 3D environments, this paper tackles a special topic which could be denominated as-is 3D building modeling with robots. We present a method with which to carry out the automatic 3D scanning of furnished buildings with the aim of obtaining complete and in-depth information regarding the principal visible structural components of an indoor environment (walls, floors and ceilings). This is an essential stage in the automatic creation of as-built BIM models that greatly facilitates the detection of the structure of a building. Our system, which is essentially composed of a mobile robot and a 3D laser scanner, autonomously navigates indoor environments that are occluded and cluttered. The approach can be considered as a structural-component based 3D mapping in which the robot moves to certain positions that are calculated using a new Next Best Scan (NBS) algorithm. We justify the contributions of our work in this research field by means of a broad theoretical comparison with other related methods. Key issues such as the complexity of the scene, occlusion, hypotheses, limitations and autonomy are discussed in the paper. This system has been tested in real and simulated environments.

1047,"The effects of intermittent and variable time delay were investigated to understand the cognitive and physical consequences of gaps between an input from an operator and the corresponding feedback response from the system. Time delay has been shown to disrupt task performance in various areas including psychology and telerobotics. Previous research in multiple domains has focused on the performance effects of time delay and overcoming technological limitations that cause time delay. However, robotics researchers have yet to study the effects of variable time delay on specific operator emotions, usability, and physiological activation in teleoperations. This study investigates the influence of variable time delay not only on task performance, but also operator emotions, physiological arousal, cognitive workload, and usability in teleoperation. Time delay was manipulated by introducing lag into the system feedback. Participants were asked to navigate a remote-control robot vehicle through mazes of differing levels of task complexity in a remote location and simultaneously identify targets. Results showed that operator frustration, anger, and workload increased while usability and task performance decreased when intermittent and variable feedback lag was introduced to a robotic navigation task. The effect of the variable time delay was greater than the effect of task complexity. Furthermore, results suggest that the effects are of time delay and task complexity are additive. A better understanding of the emotional experiences of human operators and the corresponding physiological signals is of crucial importance to designing affect-aware robotic systems that have the ability to appropriately mitigate negative operator emotional states.","['Euijung Yang', 'Michael C.

A sensitivity analysis using all available data identified the variables with the greatest influence on POC accumulation being the enzymes, which highlights the importance of microbial community interactions. However, the incorporation of experimental and field data changed the sensitivity of the model nodes ≥25% in the BN and therefore, is an important consideration when combining manipulated data sets in data limited conditions.","['Karlie Mcdonald', 'Valentina Turk', 'Pamela Mozetic', 'Tinkara Tinta', 'Francesca Malfatti', 'David M.

1049,"In this article, an exact synthesis design procedure of broadband bandpass filter using step impedance resonator (SIR) and optimum distributed high frequency (ODHF) is presented. SIR provides a large degree-of-freedom owing to its uncomplicated implementation and broad frequency operations. It offers enormous possibilities for its practical applications as well. The filtering function in this work is extracted using the equivalent circuit model. Filtering parameters can be mapped onto Chebyshev type-I polynomials for a narrowband response. However, for broadband filter response this mapping of polynomials will not produce equiripple frequency response. Therefore, the filter polynomials are adjusted such that a required bandwidth with an equiripple response is achieved. The proposed filter structure provides compactness as well as suppression of spurious resonances at high frequencies. Moreover, for the verification purpose, the proposed filter synthesis is also applied to ODHF filter topology. To validate the proposed design procedures, a microstrip-based prototypes are realized. The simulated and measured results are found in good correlation.","['Sohail Khalid', 'Muhammad Farhan Shafique']",3c78ade7-442d-46e1-b4bc-bc25008a8e6e,0,"['f95ed97c-053c-409d-b1c4-6856c5f93719', 'fc493b38-9866-4431-92cf-9b9f47768bf7']",Exact synthesis design theory of analogue broadband bandpass filter,Microelectronics Journal,2017
1050,"Large area tree maps, important for environmental monitoring and natural resource management, are often based on medium resolution satellite imagery. These data have difficulty in detecting trees in fragmented woodlands, and have significant omission errors in modified agricultural areas. High resolution imagery can better detect these trees, however, as most high resolution imagery is not normalised it is difficult to automate a tree classification method over large areas. The method developed here used an existing medium resolution map derived from either Landsat or SPOT5 satellite imagery to guide the classification of the high resolution imagery. It selected a spatially-variable threshold on the green band, calculated based on the spatially-variable percentage of trees in the existing map of tree cover. The green band proved more consistent at classifying trees across different images than several common band combinations. The method was tested on 0.5 m resolution imagery from airborne digital sensor (ADS) imagery across New South Wales (NSW), Australia using both Landsat and SPOT5 derived tree maps to guide the threshold selection. Accuracy was assessed across 6 large image mosaics revealing a more accurate result when the more accurate tree map from SPOT5 imagery was used. The resulting maps achieved an overall accuracy with 95% confidence intervals of 93% (90–95%), while the overall accuracy of the previous SPOT5 tree map was 87% (86–89%). The method reduced omission errors by mapping more scattered trees, although it did increase commission errors caused by dark pixels from water, building shadows, topographic shadows, and some soils and crops. The method allows trees to be automatically mapped at 5 m resolution from high resolution imagery, provided a medium resolution tree map already exists.","['Adrian Fisher', 'Tim Danaher', 'Tony Gill']",37b2d081-30ea-4a2e-82e2-60c6c71117cb,0,"['21f0db2f-b809-4c4c-9d65-ece605085e5f', '638446b7-13ac-499c-959e-e26ddf2ca782', '78a2f9bc-9d58-4e35-8e22-1aeb7181839c', '80846205-d569-479c-a7ab-18ba94be83c1', 'af30a715-f1a2-4424-ac8f-a385b71325f7', 'c597aa3c-6750-46ac-b310-9880fd5cd159', 'dc61301d-198f-444d-9306-4765d129f3f2', 'e1d5a55a-90e6-4956-897b-eff7d6811ee5']",Mapping trees in high resolution imagery across large areas using locally variable thresholds guided by medium resolution tree maps,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,2017
1051,"Previous intonational research on Mandarin has mainly focused on the prosody modeling of statements or the prosody analysis of interrogative sentences. To support related speech technologies, e.g., Text-to-Speech, the quantitative modeling of intonation of interrogative sentences with a large-scale corpus still deserves attention. This paper summarizes our work on the quantitative prosody modeling of interrogative sentence in Mandarin. A large-scale natural speech corpus was used in this study. By extracting the pitch contours and fitting the intonation curves, we found that F 0  declination and final lowering both existed in interrogative sentences, while they were claimed to be absent in Mandarin in some previous studies. In addition, the declination function could be modeled linearly, and the bearing unit of final lowering in Mandarin was found to be the last prosodic word in the utterance, regardless of its length, rather than a fixed duration range. It was argued in this study that the difference between this finding and the commonly believed rising intonation of the interrogative sentences resulted from the nonlinear relationship between prosody production and perception. The underlying mechanism for the existence of F 0  declination and final lowering in interrogative sentences is also discussed.","['Li Yl', 'Jianhua Tao', 'Wei Lai', 'Xiao-Ying Xu']",9730226d-c7b3-43c9-8128-b8596b271a4d,0,"['2fe36714-7acf-4306-ba5a-0bf14421b084', '3a73e364-8641-4a41-87e2-d43ae6e489cf', '3c6dada9-f886-492b-a127-b8987d3dbeda', '429969f8-2d32-4b39-96b1-9135d3ffe34f', '50c0309b-1933-4ac4-bd4d-bc79e815eaf2', '88def12d-9830-4fac-a452-4a9c2c36aeac', 'aa5b31ca-c29e-4352-8813-2bba48d80663', 'ac8cfc85-6f2c-491d-b329-6c89c1d42e1d', 'c9504e90-c8e7-4dee-8c6f-2fff58b08497', 'd3eede6c-7c80-4900-8209-fd988470c733', 'e9d5a2e6-02ed-4689-b98a-5de7ddedd9f1']",Quantitative intonation modeling of interrogative sentences for Mandarin speech synthesis,Speech Communication,2017
1052,"Abstract  Background  The general improvement of socio-economic conditions has resulted in people becoming more educated to make better-informed decisions in health related matters. Individual's perspective on health increases with better understanding of ways to improve lifestyle for better health and living. With the increase in lifestyle related diseases that lead to health problems, there is an increase in the availability of healthcare information. Thus, it is important to identify the factors that influence information seeking behaviour in the area of healthcare and lifestyle. This exploratory study examines the relationship between the factors that affect online health information-seeking behaviour among healthcare product in the capital city of Malaysia.  Method  Survey questionnaire was used to collect empirical data. A survey was conducted among 300 healthcare consumers in three main cities in Malaysia where questionnaires were personally distributed through snowball sampling. A total of 271 questionnaire forms were used in the analysis.  Results  Health Behaviour of the consumers influences Health Information Seeking Behaviour. And this relationship is strongly affected by Gender whereby the affect is strongly among females compared to males.  Conclusion  The findings indicate that Health Behaviour influences Health Information Seeking Behaviour. Marketers can find out which target segment of population to target when devising information channels for consumers, especially through the Internet. However, message that promotes positive health behaviour to a target audience who already has positive Health Behaviour increase the motivation to Health Information Seeking Behaviour.","['Noor Ismawati Jaafar', 'Sulaiman Ainin', 'Mun Wai Yeong']",83e522e6-8721-4880-9073-7da057c526cc,0,"['5d6dab2e-2047-4bc2-b112-4c267859901a', 'a1107e8c-459d-472b-b2fd-15d161277331', 'ae445411-9ab0-4023-aac5-224ee3f5fc03', 'f44f6ff4-849a-4cff-9d59-09531fc4b99b']",Why bother about health?

1053,"Networked control systems (NCSs) offer many benefits in terms of increased flexibility and maintainability but might also suffer from inevitable imperfections such as packet dropouts and limited communications resources. In this paper, (static and dynamic) event-triggered control (ETC) strategies are proposed that aim at reducing the utilization of communication resources while guaranteeing desired stability and performance criteria and a strictly positive lower bound on the inter-event times despite the presence of packet losses. For the packet losses, we consider both configurations with an acknowledgement scheme (as, e.g., in the transmission control protocol (TCP)) and without an acknowledgement scheme (as, e.g., in the user diagram protocol (UDP)). The proposed design methodology will be illustrated by means of a numerical example which reveals tradeoffs between the maximum allowable number of successive packet dropouts, (minimum and average) inter-event times and   L p        L    p         -gains of the closed-loop NCS.","['Vs Victor Dolk', 'Maurice Heemels']",c46191be-e10a-4069-bb50-b382bd71a800,0,"['10151cc6-45b2-4bf2-821c-8a5ac50a35a1', '132f6a78-0592-4bb8-801b-92f4f9c55cb1', '1bba2ae5-c33a-4a44-85da-6265635b65f5', '1d24db91-733f-4854-b091-fe485e9cb326', '2a293257-be4d-4c6f-83eb-d039b680a0f4', '35c32fa8-e9ea-4e7f-a02d-1b9849d2c13c', '3620c39c-e452-485f-9621-81b24ff47b42', '44f3db3d-cb6f-4127-9e76-b373dded3b5c', '461eb2fe-62b1-4ab1-b17e-1b4986a8f414', '4d8c1f78-6c3f-4b9a-a010-0f1d2b71cea4', '5664379d-7cb4-42bc-bd8a-970227e43dd2', '568de5a9-cea9-4abc-80e3-848f3c9e8609', '61957c2a-6cb5-4e31-9864-e891d0eb6138', '6be618ea-8146-488d-a60b-10233002f6f2', '731de7fc-03f4-4916-a8ca-672fdd618da1', '736c3dd3-5386-4fcd-a037-6e5348a66499', '98ab2424-e9eb-4ec3-8c3a-b071c2ae3705', '9918ef18-882a-4914-95f3-0da220b79778', 'b8c8f8a6-c0fa-483f-bd87-fd3bf4cc421c', 'bf7d6a42-86dd-4d84-8cae-99aa125db9aa', 'c1cc7ed0-69b2-46ad-8f14-6e81d124f344', 'eb750157-3b71-450e-bee8-78b93970e6d3', 'f9924767-a9ef-4f91-8ebc-ceb6eba40c38']",Event-triggered control systems under packet losses ☆,Automatica,2017
1054,"Context:   Software Engineering is a discipline that has been shaped by over 50 years of practice. Many have argued that its theoretical basis has been slow to develop and that, in fact, a substantial theory of Software Engineering is still lacking.     #R##N# Objective:   We propose a design theory for Software Engineering as a contribution to the debate. Having done this, we extend it to a design theory for socio-technical systems.     #R##N# Method:   We elaborate our theory based on Gregor’s influential ‘meta-theoretical’ exploration of the structural nature of a theory in the discipline of Information Systems, with particular attention to ontological and epistemological arguments.     #R##N# Results:   We argue how, from an ontological perspective, our theory embodies a view of Software Engineering as the practice of framing, representing and transforming Software Engineering problems. As such, theory statements concern the characterisation of individual problems and how problems relate and transform to other problems as part of an iterative, potentially backtracking, problem solving process, accounting for the way Software Engineering transforms the physical world to meet a recognised need. From an epistemological perspective, we argue how the theory has developed through research cycles including both theory-then-(empirical-)research and (empirical-)research-then-theory strategies spanning over a decade; both theoretical statements and related empirical evidence are included.     #R##N# Conclusion:   The resulting theory provides descriptions and explanations for many phenomena observed in Software Engineering and in the combination of software with other technologies, and embodies analytic, explanatory and predictive properties. There are however acknowledged limitations and current research to overcome them is outlined.","['Jon G.

The MIS balance heuristic has been used since its invention almost exclusively with an equal number of samples from each technique. We introduce the sampling costs and adapt the formulae to work well with them. We also show the relationship between the MIS balance heuristic and the linear combination of these techniques, and that MIS balance heuristic minimum variance is always less or equal than the minimum variance of the independent techniques.

However, visual inspection is challenging due to the diversity of the fabric patterns and defects. This paper presents an automatic defect inspection method which compares the similarities of semantic sub-images conformed to crystallographic groups called lattice. The lattices are automatically segmented based on morphological component analysis (MCA). The defect inspection is then formulated as a novel voting procedure depending on an ideal lattice artificially generated by investigating the distributions of responses given by convolving lattices with Gabor filters. The performance of the proposed method LSG (lattice segmentation assisted by Gabor filters) is evaluated on the databases of star- and box-pattern images.

1061,"This paper characterizes, through a stochastic geometry analysis, the increase in spectral efficiency that full-duplex transmission brings about in wireless networks. While, on isolated links, full-duplex promises a doubling of the spectral efficiency, in the context of a network this is weighted down by the corresponding rise in interference, and our characterization captures the balance of these effects. The analysis encompasses both the forward link (FL) and the reverse link (RL) with single-user and multiuser transmissions. And, as a complement to the analysis, Monte-Carlo simulations on a Vodafone LTE field test network are also presented. In the FL, the rise in interference is found to have minor impact and a doubling in spectral efficiency can indeed be approached, especially in microcellular networks. In the RL, however, a major difficulty arises in the form of exceedingly strong interference among base stations. This renders full-duplex transmission all but unfeasible in macrocellular networks (unless major countermeasures could be implemented) and undesirable in dense microcellular networks. Only in microcells with sufficient spacing among base stations does RL full-duplex pay off. Thus, full-duplex is seen not to blend easily with densification.","['Ratheesh Kumar Mungara', 'Ilaria Thibault', 'Angel Lozano']",fcfca877-8490-4d97-9996-75bcc403dc89,0,"['1119a520-6df6-4452-bae4-e7dd2e04fc31', '115c5017-c1dc-4218-a0c4-71c062ead531', '11e1f8f8-e12b-445a-a1f6-86f04250891d', '16c6bdf2-5137-4504-9741-4580eb667a19', '1b256e4d-9085-4951-ba6c-4aad6bbaeb9c', '1bfa7168-26a5-4047-81bc-ef7de5242cd4', '1e8db5f0-644d-4d14-a179-d880da8e2957', '1edacf5e-058d-4cde-8c0d-d53c0c2e0b92', '20d65294-055e-4e5b-83eb-8e61d3d67374', '261df10f-ffe4-4462-9847-995efc8018a0', '29267f31-b18f-461a-9091-288f730de128', '29f9920e-b148-4927-88bc-0545ff99f9be', '2a98d2b6-b4f6-4454-b658-ac19381e0583', '322483ae-9ca9-4bc4-af65-56c91e1df4c5', '33f225cb-5933-4ae1-b797-a8ee2dfaa62c', '34effb8f-2a4a-41d0-9a4e-1e84c8873b2c', '3b920791-8297-4763-a72e-f5d807dc2f53', '40d53e1b-282d-49b4-89fb-4680215b4434', '4495ae36-7aee-4d1f-8a11-3fa15c70fdbe', '4d90001e-a56a-4021-a675-6f6b8ba5173a', '50c7d33c-ed75-4e49-b5fd-a8aa0b780f85', '588d403c-fd87-42ff-ba90-61660226764c', '5b62fd3d-9fc3-4976-b780-67af31d3d641', '6bab571b-5d5f-41d3-a311-3ba2b15e0509', '6cd84b70-9bdf-4eac-a487-3619dc049598', '6ed3e0bf-869e-47a3-b949-f0e54cc1d494', '6f4a78fb-b520-4fa9-8d48-2153ba24ef26', '77b6a0f9-7697-4016-93f1-06aa0f668639', '7a51b1e6-1874-4742-904a-b456eb91f8b2', '7c017681-14bc-40f1-9021-0fe87aa1b9bb', '7f925fd5-d727-427c-8c8f-9834047074ef', '805d394d-460b-4405-909a-7ad6bd3b5ea2', '849d9028-c4ce-422c-b7ab-e72e0ca77aa9', '9ece0dd7-b4b7-4e17-b422-0313a91a7a86', '9f62aa78-6c61-4190-8d5c-8e1d4a333b52', 'a076ee0d-1ba8-4a83-8b27-759628804de1', 'b0c0cebf-991f-4f49-b4ea-46bd412caba9', 'b74b0186-5212-4129-8aaa-2a1dc08e0a73', 'c02267af-9ac2-4c2f-8c5b-90e5b70dc456', 'c185f4ab-9ec4-44c3-a798-13f8d11e86d5', 'c52753e1-7493-4168-a58f-caaa3a1bf55f', 'd70babbd-ab0a-4016-ab75-17c99b3c0db7', 'e10a2eab-e0d4-40e8-baec-a8477c3a9171', 'e4474c5a-f28c-490f-bae0-d59581472af3', 'e8b8053f-05dd-4dca-81e9-3c2f44be4dbb', 'f31d17f4-7567-4258-bfea-1bcc567dd92b']",Full-Duplex MIMO in Cellular Networks: System-Level Performance,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2017
1062,"Three-dimensional fuzzy logic controller (3D FLC) is a recently developed FLC integrating space information expression and processing for nonlinear spatially distributed dynamical systems (SDDSs). Like a traditional FLC, expert knowledge can help design a 3D FLC. Nevertheless, there are some situations where expert knowledge cannot be formulated into precise words; what's worse, it might not be explicitly expressed in words. In contrast, spatio-temporal data sets containing control laws are usually available. In this study, a data-driven based 3D FLC design method using multiple single-output support vector regressions (SVRs) is proposed for SDDSs with multiple control sources. Firstly, in terms of the locally spatial influence feature of control sources on the space domain, a complex SDDS is decomposed into multiple SDDSs with one control source and a space-decomposition based 3D fuzzy control scheme is proposed. Secondly, multiple single-output SVRs with e-insensitive cost function are used to learn and design multiple 3D FLCs from spatio-temporal data sets. Thirdly, a five-step design scheme is proposed, including space decomposition, data collection, spatial support-vector learning, 3D fuzzy rule construction, and 3D fuzzy controller integration. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a packed-bed reactor and simulation results were used to verify its effectiveness.","['Xianxia Zhang', 'Lian-rong Zhao', 'Jiajia Li', 'Guitao Cao', 'Bing Wang']",9a8d4f92-c3b5-4a82-a1bb-323bf64f01ad,0,"['07a79ee7-f9e3-4509-9ac9-92ed124ea973', '11761f92-b71e-40f2-b137-af770ae5bebd', '1c663829-e507-4ba6-885d-16b60b508f3b', '2e212a0c-1896-4bed-a136-e5fa1279139b', '36386088-54ee-474d-9182-5dda6f772cd5', '47bd74f3-2061-4d9a-9a30-def2c6276fb4', '4b01f3da-a6bf-4c7e-945f-c37017b0c651', '4f6bf055-4435-4920-8d3d-135e281dbf84', '5b203350-5795-4f6e-ac20-981203a9a1e0', '6535084a-1f36-4bff-87c4-a0fe5da14973', '66b6f3a8-f23c-443d-b196-6e1a9d9f26f9', '68c052c9-0b3c-4404-a2ad-64952d66faed', '81f54919-39a3-4339-adfc-64679646072d', '88da8563-499e-44f6-98e5-0ac1b9df292f', '918aabeb-3748-4aec-b57c-392ff6a40aef', '9e85475f-9d83-4d38-b66a-84c2f845d113', 'b62b3289-5a90-42bb-b41d-e75450cc3725', 'bbc16d10-ebf0-4ff6-90c6-b3ff5003ea67', 'c84791c4-ed6c-4706-b11f-199f5ea52f14', 'ce69e223-c948-48ab-b7ac-4b018fadec9e', 'd4d8c138-c14e-44d1-b309-ed5502fb19ac', 'e636a781-0a20-42f0-9884-936a2ff3083b', 'ef29e562-88e3-422a-82c6-bbd2b5b919d3']",Space-decomposition based 3D fuzzy control design for nonlinear spatially distributed systems with multiple control sources using multiple single-output SVR learning,Applied Soft Computing,2017

1064,"Assorted bibliometric indices have been proposed leading to ambiguity in choosing the appropriate metric for evaluation. On the other hand, attempts to fit universal distribution patterns to scientific output have not converged to unified conclusions. To this end, we introduce the concept of fractal dimension to further examine the citation curve of an author. The fractal dimension of the citation curve could provide insight in its shape and form, level of skewness and distance from uniformity as well as the existing publishing patterns, without a priori assumptions on the particular citation distribution. It is shown that the notion of fractal dimension is not correlated to other well-known bibliometric indices. Further, a thorough experimentation of the fractal dimension is presented by using a set of 30,000 computer scientists and more than 9 million publications with over 38 million citations. The distinguishing power of the fractal dimension is investigated when comparing the impact of scientists and when trying to identify award winning scientists in their respective fields.","['Antonia Gogoglou', 'Antonis Sidiropoulos', 'Dimitrios Katsaros', 'Yannis Manolopoulos']",efe5524d-1fff-401b-a9b4-c882a223e5ab,0,"['04cbfeb5-0ebd-4848-8e02-98c4bb6c9dd2', '15902fad-8dc1-4370-bae9-c19a6a0c3672', '1af9c179-6225-4fdb-957b-bed97db48935', '1eade08e-80fd-4cd7-81ee-e18ce88d05f0', '3854e0f9-42e1-4ce1-85e0-6cd03c7c5efa', '44cd5a10-0989-46b9-9419-2e3070535c85', '51d125e8-3d8c-4ea1-8fc7-e05897ab7a44', '5ad7783b-6925-4797-9dea-03b8e7f9b771', '62efce1e-6d76-4f78-aa1f-a258a24f3acb', '640e1db8-9083-48f7-ade8-7772d1467e28', '6c030207-7174-4756-9ddb-8f32416a9fd0', '724e53bf-a933-45ff-8bc2-c1d8b47a2ffb', '78be3bab-33a3-49b4-b599-ef90d194dddd', '79640d3b-2b33-47be-8897-5c93bcba0b02', '7afc2701-1300-46ea-87cc-ef2f5c273c69', '8963f60f-07f4-4d17-8afe-da0505bfe99b', '8ecab27f-3c85-4557-834c-24d4fa4e6b6e', '975be028-b7e3-49a2-aa41-ae415cc6356c', '9d7ff0b7-b64b-4b85-b25c-b21b177b2c4b', 'ab34111e-bd13-473a-b8f6-7e28361403c9', 'af984e40-84f4-4b6c-be2e-21c49319255b', 'c7e4e04b-45da-4bae-8c8a-d17ca0087361', 'c85123da-f6e0-4309-8881-fccbd86d3c8c', 'cf324414-260d-4681-ad1d-544c58c47fc1', 'd0aeb5e5-c85e-49b8-b795-be2444bc4482', 'd4a0b3d9-0355-4740-95fd-1193cac90243', 'f250c381-2586-4229-90da-3670ed4d3576', 'f9353244-f8e3-461e-a47a-cab8b8ef60d7', 'facf07bc-45e9-4198-b9b0-819311d057eb']",The fractal dimension of a citation curve: quantifying an individual’s scientific output using the geometry of the entire curve,Scientometrics,2017
1065,"Recently, processors have begun integrating 3D stacked DRAMs with the cores on the same package, and there have been several approaches to effectively utilizing the on-package DRAMs as caches. This article presents an approach that combines the previous approaches in a synergistic way by devising a module called the dirty-block tracker to maintain the dirtiness of each block in a dirty region. The approach avoids unnecessary tag checking for a write operation if the corresponding block in the cache is not dirty. Our simulation results show that the proposed technique achieves a 10.3% performance improvement on average over the state-of-the-art DRAM cache technique.","['Dongwoo Lee', 'Sangheon Lee', 'Soojung Ryu', 'Kiyoung Choi']",a4eefade-4787-40cb-b413-07bc5785e7e6,0,"['1a46ad7f-1e25-497a-9049-bd352a867433', '1ff818e7-560c-4b62-a455-9275142fdb6c', '2a8aaed4-7285-4544-8cb6-9d5fbe358a7d', '3da00ced-06e5-41a4-87cb-308c9eee5bfe', '4d7dc77f-477e-4485-95fa-28146e2e0288', '543a7ee5-c3af-4e2a-8506-a544ce8f2f72', '61296c04-c664-4de1-a308-74b64cbe5edf', '778e3c5e-4a37-48df-adf6-dba4404b3037', '8d4d56a1-cdba-43fb-9e13-0b2a6bd96c7e', '8e2cf649-0dbf-4142-82df-698dc848fe3f', 'b1937e8b-f026-4f0c-aa9a-a39d92920c79', 'b89f30e1-0984-4258-9af1-7da848fad33b', 'bf5f15b8-51ca-4970-94bc-8a89c6370db7', 'd0c3508e-f75b-4026-b85f-c4bf1b9203e1', 'ddcd052a-6d09-4829-871d-8416623a750d', 'e06a002b-7783-498d-96f1-ef860345bccc', 'e792118e-8bfb-463e-9161-15dedb2a5b57', 'f7df19be-3d73-48c0-b4a8-bfd410ec9bf8']",Dirty-Block Tracking in a Direct-Mapped DRAM Cache with Self-Balancing Dispatch,ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization,2017

However, there is still a long way to standardize SDN east/westbound due to the high complexity and comprehensive optimization goals. To make it possible to deploy SDN in the Internet to support both traditional and emerging network applications, we propose a lightweight collaborative controller mechanism which has advantageous characteristics such as application independent, controller independent, minimum functions, reliability and etc. We, also design its software program named LCMSCware running on each controller and its application layer protocol enabling corporation among the controllers. The prototype system is implemented and the experimental results demonstrate that LCMSC enables efficient cooperation among heterogeneous controllers in multiple SDN domains connected by Internet and support both existing and emerging services.","['Ming Chen', 'Ke Ding', 'Jie Hao', 'Chao Hu', 'Gaogang Xie', 'Changyou Xing', 'Bing Chen']",a9c9e2d1-8faa-4efe-8982-0e69997a1551,0,"['15558d2b-d3e0-44b5-adbf-1a7fd837e933', '15c46eef-d08e-44b1-af4e-fd7b06b02095', '1d2f01e0-7592-49f1-9b36-10eedd2d37d7', '25b324c3-3a1d-4e7a-983c-fa1467937bd2', '28f22fc4-0e3e-4530-b1e5-cb37e95bfd40', '683a2948-2d37-4166-a0e4-546e716b7403', '72db976e-5886-4750-a650-0ef209e3a51c', '94f07791-d2e5-46f6-9f97-483814068150', 'adb6664e-84c0-4b3e-8d7f-59a6c6536596', 'eb86675a-0390-46d1-8401-8eca93d3412c', 'f8d0ae91-8deb-47ba-b940-8170348d581b', 'fcdf311f-e68a-4022-a677-e666ff355f44', 'fe5a7f26-42b9-41fa-bea4-126b3281195d']",LCMSC: A lightweight collaborative mechanism for SDN controllers,Computer Networks,2017

However, the growth of mobile computing can be enhanced by integrating mobile computing into cloud computing, and hence a new paradigm of computing called mobile cloud computing emerges. In here, the data is stored in cloud infrastructure and the actual execution is shifted to cloud environment so that a mobile user is set free from resource constrained issue of existing mobile devices. Moreover, to avail the cloud services, the communications between mobile devices and clouds are held through wireless medium. Thus, some new classes of security and privacy challenges are introduced. The purpose of this survey is to present the main security and privacy challenges in this field which have grown much interest among the academia and research community. Although, there are many challenges, corresponding security solutions have been proposed and identified in literature by many researchers to counter the challenges.

1069,"With the advancement of photo editing software, digital documents can easily be altered, which causes some legal issues. This paper proposes an image authentication method, which determines whether an image is authentic. Unlike many existing methods that only work with images in the JPEG format, the proposed method is image format independent, implying that it works with both noncompressed images and images in all compression formats. To improve the authentication accuracy, some strategies, such as overlapping image blocks only on concurrent directions, using a two-scale local binary pattern operator, and choosing the mean deviation instead of the standard deviation, are applied. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is used instead of support vector machines (SVMs) for classification to make online learning easier and achieve higher accuracy.

We specifically deal with the problematic aspects, such as PlanetLab service availability, networking performance, geographical accuracy, and DNS addressing correctness. Some of the PlanetLab ‘negative’ properties evaluated in this paper are required and needed as PlanetLab was established to reflect the real (erroneous) communication in the Internet. Nevertheless, one should be aware of them to set-up experiments correctly, run them smoothly, and not to misinterpret the results. Based on the observations presented, we give a set of simple conclusions that should help engineers to achieve valid Internet experiment results.","['Dan Komosny', 'Sasa Mrdovic', 'Pavol Ilko', 'Matej Grejtak', 'O.

To test and analyze the performance of the MFA algorithm, the presented method are tested on ten test color image and the results are compared with basic firefly algorithm (FA), Brownian search based firefly algorithm (BFA) and Levy search based firefly algorithm (LFA). The experimental results show that the presented MFA algorithm outperforms all the other algorithms in term of the optimal threshold value, objective function, PSNR, SSIM value and convergence. In MFA algorithm, chaotic map is used to the initialization of firefly population, which can enhance the diversification. In addition, global search method of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced into the movement phase of fireflies.

1072,"For any wine estate, there is a need to demarcate homogeneous within-vineyard zones (‘terroirs’) so as to manage grape production, which depends on vine biological condition. Until now, the studies performing digital zoning of terroirs have relied on recent spatial data and scant attention has been paid to ancient geoinformation likely to retrace past biological condition of vines and especially occurrence of vine mortality. Is vine mortality characterized by recurrent and specific patterns and if so, are these patterns related to terroir units and/or past landuse? This study aimed at performing a historical and spatial tracing of vine mortality patterns using a long time-series of aerial survey images (1947–2010), in combination with recent data: soil apparent electrical conductivity EM38 measurements, very high resolution Pleiades satellite images, and a detailed field survey. Within a 6 ha-estate in the Southern Rhone Valley, landuse and planting history were retraced and the map of missing vines frequency was constructed from the whole time series including a 2015-Pleiades panchromatic band. Within-field terroir units were obtained from a support vector machine classifier computed on the spectral bands and NDVI of Pleiades images, EM38 data and morphometric data.#R##N##R##N#Repeated spatial patterns of missing vines were highlighted throughout several plantings, uprootings, and vine replacements, and appeared to match some within-field terroir units, being explained by their specific soil characteristics, vine/soil management choices and the past landuse of the 1940s. Missing vines frequency was spatially correlated with topsoil CaCO3 content, and negatively correlated with topsoil iron, clay, total N, organic C contents and NDVI. A retrospective spatio-temporal assessment of terroir therefore brings a renewed focus on some key parameters for maintaining a sustainable grape production.","['Emmanuelle Vaudour', 'Ludovicl Leclercq', 'J.

1073,"A time-domain method for calculating the defect states of scalar waves in two-dimensional (2D) periodic structures is proposed. In the time-stepping process of the proposed method, the column vector containing the spatially sampled field values is updated by multiplying it with an iteration matrix, which is written in a matrix-exponential form. The matrix-exponential is first computed by using the Suzuki's decomposition based technique of the fourth order, in which the Floquet–Bloch boundary conditions are incorporated. The obtained iteration matrix is then squared to enlarge the time-step that can be used in the time-stepping process (namely, the squaring technique), and the small nonzero elements in the iteration matrix is finally pruned to improve the sparse structure of the matrix (namely, the pruning technique). The numerical examples of the super-cell calculations for 2D defect-containing phononic crystal structures show that, the fourth order decomposition based technique for the matrix-exponential computation is much more efficient than the frequently used precise integration technique (PIT) if the PIT is of an order greater than 2. Although it is not unconditionally stable, the proposed time-domain method is particularly efficient for the super-cell calculations of the defect states in a 2D periodic structure containing a defect with a wave speed much higher than those of the background materials. For this kind of defect-containing structures, the time-stepping process can run stably for a sufficiently large number of the time-steps with a time-step much larger than the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) upper limit, and consequently the overall efficiency of the proposed time-domain method can be significantly higher than that of the conventional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Some physical interpretations on the properties of the band structures and the defect states of the calculated periodic structures are also presented.","['Xiao-Xing Su', 'Yue-Sheng Wang', 'Chuanzeng Zhang']",037570e3-124b-40bd-8d8c-4e51425c5531,0,"['24a184cb-a6a9-4a6e-a06b-c3b3e4b3178c', '2fdb4d01-da3a-4cbd-8c47-2bfc648c22d5', '532ee8d6-ec36-4bae-9932-7aa97022bb87', '5cff496c-4dca-49d0-ac8e-6f3dfb70be8d', '8edab238-e566-4dca-bf4c-5f08f8272c37', 'dd139b93-4707-4e2c-9603-38520515e91f', 'e0a0ef77-761d-456d-ba82-87ec8df1cb40']",A matrix-exponential decomposition based time-domain method for calculating the defect states of scalar waves in two-dimensional periodic structures,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
1074,"Characterizing the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) of a vector-valued random variable with probability distribution concentrated on a manifold is a relevant problem in data-driven settings. The probability distribution of such random vectors is multimodal in general, leading to potentially very slow convergence of the PCE. In this paper, we build on a recent development for estimating and sampling from probabilities concentrated on a diffusion manifold. The proposed methodology constructs a PCE of the random vector together with an associated generator that samples from the target probability distribution which is estimated from data concentrated in the neighborhood of the manifold. The method is robust and remains efficient for high dimension and large datasets. The resulting polynomial chaos construction on manifolds permits the adaptation of many uncertainty quantification and statistical tools to emerging questions motivated by data-driven queries.","['Christian Soize', 'Roger Ghanem']",6750378d-2b48-41e5-9ed4-7dcd7d21b122,0,"['1a17a4a7-b6b2-4956-b324-e2aed2756c64', '1d94a763-f845-4b3f-b336-5a44255c7d23', '48f5610b-dc5e-4d78-a42d-560179a5869d', '5a0ab5f7-7631-4b12-8357-2df3e51e26d6', '5b90d475-3c91-4ed8-ba89-e19402b73a5b', '69f24be9-fd65-45a3-9029-fde889f3ae76', '76f12e63-d67d-4096-a16f-e7ba9d2bdb9a', '837acc44-69af-4fe1-a05d-39d113ebe79c', '8437162d-bc5b-4401-b9ef-d1ead0bcf6cd', '878f34f9-8e9a-46bb-8d79-82f56751b967', 'a73932c6-ebd5-4fe2-a161-fe3f00139f1c', 'b181bca4-dd5e-4252-ad29-1c2831435d77', 'b45f7c4a-fcb5-4f56-b233-d7cffe63649e', 'b8c4d4f8-9a79-4524-9e44-73549eeccf53', 'cf11a161-8ebc-49d2-a1dc-235b64c8fafb']",Polynomial chaos representation of databases on manifolds,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
1075,"Congestion control in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is considered to be a significant challenge and important issue which is related to inherent resource limitation, many-to-one communication scheme and the number of developed sensor nodes. Inasmuch as congestion has significant impacts on (Quality of Service), packet delivery rate, end-to-end delay and energy consumption, it should be controlled. In WSNs, congestion is attributed to parameters such as collision, buffer overflow, channel constraints and the transmission rate. The phenomenon of congestion in WSNs can be handled in two ways: reducing data traffic and increasing network resources. Since packets are not received properly in the intermediate nodes when congestion occurs, hence, appropriate routing towards the sink node cannot be accomplished. The method proposed in this study was intended to sort out the above-mentioned issue of delivering transmitted packets to the sink node. Thus, in this paper we used a hierarchical tree and grid structure to produce an initial topology and Prim’s algorithm to find appropriate neighbors. In the proposed method, a hierarchical tree structure was used to produce network topologies and a resource control algorithm was used as a factor to control congestion in wireless sensor networks. In this study, active queue management was used to transmit data with varying priorities. In case congestion occurs, by selecting nodes of the same level and replacing them, the proposed algorithm attempts to reduce congestion. The results of simulation indicated that the proposed algorithm is a highly effective method for congestion control in WSNs in comparing with other congestion control scheme.","['Hossein Dabbagh Nikokheslat', 'Ali Ghaffari']",23beb4a5-b637-466b-95bc-7cf5e0f729aa,0,"['15dd0141-f219-4bbc-89b9-b768aeac4799', '2fbc4b3c-aff4-49f2-a851-ec9a5e24689c', '3ab56020-becb-424e-bec1-52cbf52e17eb', '4a084252-e33e-448d-bf77-414fafae0351', '56403009-fa68-4be0-af49-b725dc76120b', '6a57607c-a43a-49b1-a761-e4e4a784474c', '90a8af23-9a2a-4fdc-ada2-e710f086e87f', 'afb68332-5c98-4ec4-a9c7-b1e218a0d894', 'b519d342-9a69-4533-a9de-871b52294640', 'b8bfe2af-a53e-4a11-bda2-1822b35baa77', 'c0953c0b-c72c-4598-8211-2313d494014c', 'c29c6e22-a806-47c2-a181-60fa93f99ed4', 'c8cf2c8e-aee4-417f-b1ca-63308741b20f', 'e2f21034-6eab-4553-acca-e9f84f0ae8c1', 'f91ef229-19b7-4387-bff7-21f7448d7219']",Protocol for Controlling Congestion in Wireless Sensor Networks,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
1076,"In magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, multiple transmitters (TXs) are used to enhance the efficiency of simultaneous power transfer to multiple receivers (RXs) by constructively combining their induced magnetic fields, a technique termed “magnetic beamforming”. In this paper, we study the optimal magnetic beamforming design in a multiuser MIMO MRC-WPT system. We introduce and characterize the multiuser power region, which constitutes all the achievable power tuples for all RXs, subject to the given total power constraint over all TXs as well as their individual peak voltage and current constraints. For the special case without TX peak voltage and current constraints, we derive the optimal TX current allocation for the single-RX setup in closed-form and that for the multi-RX setup by applying the techniques of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and time-sharing. In general, the problem is a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), which is difficult to solve. For the case of one single RX, we show that the SDR of the problem is tight and thus solve the problem efficiently. For the general case with multiple RXs, based on SDR we obtain two approximate solutions by applying the techniques of time-sharing and randomization, respectively. Moreover, we propose a new method to estimate the magnetic MIMO channel between TXs and RXs for practical implementation of magnetic beamforming. Numerical results show that our proposed magnetic channel estimation and adaptive beamforming schemes are practically effective and can significantly improve the power transfer efficiency and multiuser performance tradeoff in MIMO MRC-WPT systems compared with the benchmark scheme of uncoordinated WPT with fixed identical TXs' current.","['Gang Yang', 'Mohammad R.

1078,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the extended dissipative filter design problems for continuous-time fuzzy systems with time-varying delays under imperfect premise variables based on a unified performance index−extended dissipative. Attention is focused on solving the H∞, L2 − L∞, passive and dissipative filtering problems for fuzzy systems with time-varying delays under this unified framework. Based on the unified performance index, a new delay-dependent filter design approach in terms of linear matrix inequalities is obtained by employing Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method together with a novel efficient integral inequality.

1080,"Fundamental relations between information and estimation have been established in the literature for the discrete-time Gaussian and Poisson channels. In this paper, we demonstrate that such relations hold for a much larger class of observation models. We introduce the natural family of discrete-time Levy channels where the distribution of the output conditioned on the input is infinitely divisible. For Levy channels, we establish new representations relating the mutual information between the channel input and output to an optimal expected estimation loss, thereby unifying and considerably extending results from the Gaussian and Poisson settings. We demonstrate the richness of our results by working out two examples of Levy channels, namely the gamma channel and the negative binomial channel, with corresponding relations between information and estimation. Extensions to the setting of mismatched estimation are also presented.","['Jiantao Jiao', 'Kartik Venkat', 'Tsachy Weissman']",7d1efdb1-a8ba-4274-872e-c8b1117ac899,0,"['357bd04d-c021-4255-ab9f-ed77953ce290', '874f28a5-b776-43ec-bf82-f4eb8fe27637', '9a3977d8-977e-4855-837e-0ce35a43c913', 'ab480eae-6a1e-4ca7-88b0-5b9eda6081b6', 'e6ac3d40-08d4-441f-b573-a6799c31229d', 'facad141-163a-497f-9478-ece43f76b6a5']",Relations Between Information and Estimation in Discrete-Time Lévy Channels,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,2017
1081,"This study aimed to investigate the fatiguing characteristics of muscle-tendon units (MTUs) within skeletal muscles during static isometric contraction tasks. The deltoid was selected as the target muscle and three head-related static isometric contraction tasks were designed to activate three heads of the deltoid in different modes. Nine male subjects participated in this study. Surface electromyography (SEMG) signals were collected synchronously from the three heads of the deltoid. The performances of five SEMG parameters, including root mean square (RMS), mean power frequency (MPF), the first coefficient of autoregressive model (ARC1), sample entropy (SE) and Higuchi’s fractal dimension (HFD), in quantification of fatigue, were evaluated in terms of sensitivity to variability ratio (SVR) and consistency firstly. Then, the HFD parameter was selected as the fatigue index for further muscle fatigue analysis. The experimental results demonstrated that the three deltoid heads presented different activation modes during three head-related fatiguing contractions. The fatiguing characteristics of the three heads were found to be task-dependent, and the heads kept in a relatively high activation level were more prone to fatigue. In addition, the differences in fatiguing rate between heads increased with the increase in load. The findings of this study can be helpful in better understanding the underlying neuromuscular control strategies of the central nervous system (CNS). Based on the results of this study, the CNS was thought to control the contraction of the deltoid by taking the three heads as functional units, but a certain synergy among heads might also exist to accomplish a contraction task.","['Wenxiang Cui', 'X.

The paper proposes to apply Deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to IIT(BHU) newborn database. The database has its own advantages where the quality of images is high and segregation has been done for various expressions of newborn. The Deep CNN applied in this paper is more advantageous when compared to regular MLP. Along with this the results taken from application of proposed technique have been compared to state-of-the-art technique applied on the same database and it shows improved results. It has been found Deep CNN improves PCA by 22.09%, LDA by 12.98%, ICA by 11.35%, LBP by 17.08% and SURF by 10.8% for Neutral-Neutral faces.

1083,"Nowadays, a big part of people rely on available content in social media in their decisions (e.g., reviews and feedback on a topic or product). The possibility that anybody can leave a review provides a golden opportunity for spammers to write spam reviews about products and services for different interests. Identifying these spammers and the spam content is a hot topic of research, and although a considerable number of studies have been done recently toward this end, but so far the methodologies put forth still barely detect spam reviews, and none of them show the importance of each extracted feature type. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named  NetSpam , which utilizes spam features for modeling review data sets as heterogeneous information networks to map spam detection procedure into a classification problem in such networks. Using the importance of spam features helps us to obtain better results in terms of different metrics experimented on real-world review data sets from Yelp and Amazon Web sites. The results show that  NetSpam  outperforms the existing methods and among four categories of features, including review-behavioral, user-behavioral, review-linguistic, and user-linguistic, the first type of features performs better than the other categories.","['Saeedreza Shehnepoor', 'Mostafa E.

1084,"Clustering analysis is a basic and essential method for mining heterogeneous information networks, which consist of multiple types of objects and rich semantic relations among different object types. Heterogeneous information networks are ubiquitous in the real-world applications, such as bibliographic networks and social media networks. Unfortunately, most existing approaches, such as spectral clustering, are designed to analyze homogeneous information networks, which are composed of only one type of objects and links. Some recent studies focused on heterogeneous information networks and yielded some research fruits, such as RankClus and NetClus. However, they often assumed that the heterogeneous information networks usually follow some simple schemas, such as bityped network schema or star network schema. To overcome the above limitations, we model the heterogeneous information network as a tensor without the restriction of network schema. Then, a tensor CP decomposition method is adapted to formulate the clustering problem in heterogeneous information networks. Further, we develop two stochastic gradient descent algorithms, namely, SGDClus and SOSClus, which lead to effective clustering multityped objects simultaneously. The experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world dataset have demonstrated that our proposed clustering framework can model heterogeneous information networks efficiently and outperform state-of-the-art clustering methods.","['Jibing Wu', 'Zhifei Wang', 'Yahui Wu', 'Lihua Liu', 'Su Deng', 'Hongbin Huang']",1932056e-1cb5-4f46-848e-563fa4b7bba0,0,"['06dc0648-62ce-4357-8fb5-9d0dbd83faed', '237c4c64-5a25-45e4-a9e4-dd121f176d7c', '29e1d448-53c2-4286-a929-8f11fd11c64a', '30ea33a0-c0bd-4675-9e1e-9b8341dfeb56', '51cfdd10-1566-4380-adae-3889630ebaf4', '75951c61-a613-4fa1-aa06-92507534d559', '7a3158d8-405a-4df7-9611-b0ff4eb86a25', '7abd5ce4-3aff-4598-b897-9009959fc8db', '7c90045b-63b9-4f29-82a0-bf7c914a6ef6', 'a5fc8aed-b007-4ed1-92ee-81fad0dc67d2', 'b2160fed-8881-48c7-8cfa-f2335789ccf1', 'b8c81b1a-5e35-49e8-bc79-398da4aad3b3', 'c368fc73-34e5-4c50-a59c-ad117c2228b3']",A Tensor CP Decomposition Method for Clustering Heterogeneous Information Networks via Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms,Scientific Programming,2017

1086,"In this paper, a visual analysis methodology is proposed to perform comparative analysis of guided random algorithms such as evolutionary optimization algorithms and community detection algorithms. Proposed methodology is designed based on quantile-quantile plot and regression analysis to compare performance of one algorithm over other algorithms. The methodology is extrapolated as one-to-one comparison, one-to-many comparison and many-to-many comparison of solution quality and convergence rate. Most of the existing approaches utilize both solution quality and convergence rate to perform comparative analysis. However, the many-to-many comparison i.e. ranking of algorithms is done only with solution quality. On the contrary, with proposed methodology ranking of algorithms is done in terms of both solution quality and convergence rate. Proposed methodology is studied with four evolutionary optimization algorithms on 25 benchmark functions. A non-parametric statistical analysis called Wilcoxon signed-rank test is also performed to verify the indication of proposed methodology. Moreover, methodology is also applied to analyze four state-of-the-art community detection algorithms on 10 real-world networks.","['Anupam Biswas', 'Bhaskar Biswas']",e86a0a69-50f8-45df-9ac4-66467886dff3,0,"['01ec7aff-c4ea-4844-91fe-04e8009033bd', '042a9db6-d8c5-4286-a701-3723778c410c', '059593fb-a1ca-4f71-908a-4531a9e7ccfa', '06dc0648-62ce-4357-8fb5-9d0dbd83faed', '0718dc34-4b49-4b24-8a2e-b5cd0d9d82c6', '08097488-f4b5-48fe-845b-a4e9a63f5171', '10a48d0a-60bd-4766-84eb-3c145adb5d0c', '1611bd0f-ab49-4f77-8830-e60b42fd8689', '194714ec-9204-422e-9f53-e719564cb571', '230f2872-a960-4296-811c-1e11f3b6ef2e', '2ecd1bdc-3713-4dde-b9ef-5c07862237f7', '2f082a6f-9356-45f8-b4ff-4409c48ba0ec', '34a83e5d-8e80-4d99-ab1b-31aed5410ffa', '42fa8744-b895-4039-a2f4-ddcfc84f6553', '4470b29d-eb3f-4366-a91a-75e913585fc9', '499b5506-7120-4104-a3cc-a57835d8e9cc', '4cd201ac-4a6b-4b5d-9dbb-67cf7eb0e9cb', '55b16435-b4c7-4f26-93f4-54e10f871594', '608ab163-0fbf-4c6e-bf21-29b3145bae2a', '694c44a6-f0ce-4391-94f8-6925ed1e3974', '75113ab3-95f1-498d-a06c-e182a7cb26e5', '86bd7bca-f666-44f1-96b7-04626bdef9b4', '894e9124-f437-4f6d-8891-aebe0d0c5c75', '938e0357-60ec-43fb-837b-7a2613f7672b', '99d6825f-a62d-44c2-b841-1bb7c13b5477', 'a075f098-00c1-4c80-a9d3-decd2624a600', 'a1bd4b68-fd48-4ad1-9f42-42c4721f1e60', 'a4bf4be9-17bf-43de-9cb1-18c75ce8e26a', 'bbe45431-918e-49b7-805c-e65579479f6d', 'cc2e98b6-dd54-41ca-b47c-9304d5cf170e', 'd7670a65-61a0-45ea-919a-712cac564329', 'e9d4d113-9759-432a-a860-beb92183c6a3', 'eaea5550-6ac8-474b-8602-6d6e226c3569', 'fbab2500-7cba-46c0-b370-8c3ba938b950', 'fd2b1439-1d2b-4b47-b5e4-dc05a60440e8', 'fff813dc-4380-40ec-a76c-5136eb821a4d']",Analyzing evolutionary optimization and community detection algorithms using regression line dominance,Information Sciences,2017

This method is applied to a modified form St(f,g)QtSt(f,g)Qt of the ttth subresultant matrix St(f,g)St(f,g) of the Sylvester resultant matrix S(f,g)S(f,g) of f(y)f(y) and g(y)g(y), where QtQt is a diagonal matrix of combinatorial terms. This modified subresultant matrix has significant computational advantages with respect to the standard subresultant matrix St(f,g)St(f,g), and it yields better results for AGCD computations. It is shown that f(y)f(y) and g(y)g(y) must be processed by three operations before St(f,g)QtSt(f,g)Qt is formed, and the consequence of these operations is the introduction of two parameters, αα and θθ, such that the entries of St(f,g)QtSt(f,g)Qt are non-linear functions of α,θα,θ and the coefficients of f(y)f(y) and g(y)g(y).

A usual method consists in using the Newton–Raphson algorithm or its derivatives, either in floating or in fixed-point formats. With the former format, the standardized format of the mantissa makes the implementation easier, but for the fixed-point format there are many possibilities. This forces a design with scaling of the input in order to respect a predetermined work range. Having the input in a known range makes it possible to compute a first approximation with coefficients stored in memory blocks. With this method, it is hard to propose a “ready to use” IP for all the fixed-point formats. In this letter, a novel architecture, which does not require scaling, is proposed. This design is totally pipelined, ROM-less and can be directly used in any architecture. The implementation was optimized to reach a maximum clock frequency of 740 MHz on a Virtex-7 Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).","['Erwan Libessart', 'Matthieu Arzel', 'Cyril Lahuec', 'Francesco P.

1089,"ABSTRACTThe ability of automatically identifying users’ personality is an important part of building adaptive systems and providing personalised services. However, there is still a lack of evaluation methods which can not only unobtrusively gather user data without supplement equipment, but also provide accurate and real-time prediction of users’ personality. This paper presents a new approach to identifying personality by combining writing features and machine learning techniques. We conducted an exploratory study where we collected participants’ handwriting information and personality information via questionnaire. From these data, we extracted writing features and created classifiers for seven personality dimensions. Our top results include a unique set of writing features which could be predictive of personality and binary classifiers for the seven personality dimensions, with accuracies ranging from 62.5% to 83.9%.

1090,"The task assignment problem (TAP) aims to assign application tasks to a number of distributed processors in a computation system in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the system for minimizing or maximizing a certain cost. The problem is NP-hard; thus, finding the exact solutions is computationally intractable for larger size problems.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, a novel entropic simplified swarm optimization, known as ESSO, is proposed for solving this problem. In this method, an entropic local search (ELS) inspired by information theory is proposed to enhance the exploitation capability of SSO. Entropy is adopted to describe the uncertainty level of assigned tasks; the task with higher uncertainty then has more chance to be reassigned. Furthermore, for each reassigned task, the corresponding list of potential processors can be constructed using information theory; this enhances the probability of finding promising solutions in ELS.#R##N##R##N#To empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed method, experiments are conducted using twenty-four randomly generated problems ranging from small to large scale, and the corresponding results are compared with existing works.

1091,"ABSTRACTThis paper investigates the H∞ control problem of the attitude stabilisation of a rigid spacecraft with external disturbances using prediction-based sampled-data control strategy. Aiming to achieve a ‘virtual’ closed-loop system, a type of parameterised sampled-data controller is designed by introducing a prediction mechanism. The resultant closed-loop system is equivalent to a hybrid system featured by a continuous-time and an impulsive differential system. By using a time-varying Lyapunov functional, a generalised bounded real lemma (GBRL) is first established for a kind of impulsive differential system. Based on this GBRL and Lyapunov functional approach, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee the closed-loop system to be asymptotically stable and to achieve a prescribed H∞ performance. In addition, the controller parameter tuning is cast into a convex optimisation problem. Simulation and comparative results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed control scheme.","['Baolong Zhu', 'Zhiping Zhang', 'Ding Zhou', 'Jie Ma', 'Shunli Li']",128754b4-6353-41a6-809b-0d6a81ca8b26,0,"['01c37d63-7955-4497-9f3e-d8c22af4de99', '03b5908e-21fc-4963-b6f7-eb28c3ea944c', '111b79ec-e2d4-43da-90fd-f319ab45633a', '1b1457cd-a41d-4519-a87e-1c15a5f5f672', '294c80db-32d3-48d5-a0b0-2c9c18f29d27', '2b932a03-02ec-4f5b-b70c-d61dc1944173', '2ed75449-93eb-4bdf-8292-a62714e67b27', '378da92e-502d-4d56-b327-22ff58750137', '473967fb-4cd4-44fc-8177-db547e98c8aa', '6d8e0226-1b65-47e6-bde3-a3d50377d153', '6de4b93c-b1a6-489d-8296-bee823ad6836', '86eb0e6f-0ae7-4b83-8ecb-654473f6ce18', 'a524543e-ba78-487f-9a2c-0542fc32e3ea', 'a8d12b06-2632-4205-8439-033497c0c34a', 'aea18a69-1d93-4cc3-9768-802466b6f3eb', 'b43765ec-78ec-469d-84e7-24e17ceac84c', 'b500d782-3187-4990-ae3f-67e992a4e2b4', 'cb795d02-bb85-4f0d-a154-352f101dc299', 'dbc8957a-ec6a-4e9c-8685-7ce4f940140d', 'e54030af-981b-4746-9aa6-e969c45d0373', 'f1cce21a-e7c1-4e19-9111-0dd9d9ec94ee', 'f390c522-6016-4520-a2ca-7bb42343c1c6']",Prediction-based sampled-data H∞ controller design for attitude stabilisation of a rigid spacecraft with disturbances,International Journal of Systems Science,2017
1092,"This paper presents a numerical investigation of the solution of the steady-state one-dimensional Drift-Flux Model. It is proposed that these simulations, though often based on finite-volume discretizations and iterative sequential procedures, are preferably performed using established numerical methods specifically devised for Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAE) systems. Both strategies were implemented in a computer code developed for simulations of multicomponent hydrocarbon two-phase flows. The SIMPLER semi-implicit algorithm was employed in the solution of the finite-volume discretized model in order to provide comparison grounds with the adaptive BDF-implementation of DAE integration package DASSLC. Based on test simulations of a naphtha two-phase flow under varying heat-transfer conditions, the DAE approach was proved highly advantageous in terms of computational requirements and accuracy of results, both in the absence and presence of flow-pattern transitions. Numerical difficulties arising from the latter were successfully worked around by continuously switching regime-specific constitutive correlations using adjustable steep regularization functions.","['Rodrigo Teixeira', 'Argimiro Resende Secchi', 'Evaristo C.

1093,"Identifying players in soccer videos is a challenging task, especially in overview shots. Face recognition is not feasible due to low resolution, and jersey number recognition suffers from low resolution, motion blur and unsuitable player pose. Therefore, a method to improve visual identification using spatial constellations is proposed here. This method models a spatial constellation as a histogram over relative positions among all players of the team. Using constellation features might increase identification performance but is not expected to work well as a single mean of identification. Thus, this constellation-based recognition is combined with jersey number recognition using convolutional neural networks. Recognizing the numbers on a player’s shirt is the most straight-forward approach, as there is a direct mapping between numbers and players.#R##N##R##N#Using spatial constellation as a feature for identification is based on the assumption that players do not move randomly over the pitch. Players rather follow a tactical role such as central defender, winger, forward, etc. However in soccer, players do not strictly adhere to these roles, variations occur more or less frequently. By learning constellation models for each player, we avoid a categorical assignment of a player to one single tactical role and therefore incorporate each player’s typical behaviour in terms of switching positions.#R##N##R##N#The presented player identification process is expressed as an assignment problem. Here, an optimal assignment of manually labeled trajectories to known player identities is calculated. Using an assignment problem allows for a flexible fusion of constellation features and jersey numbers by combining the respective cost matrices. Evaluation is performed on 14 different shots of six different Bundesliga matches. By combining both modalities, the accuracy is improved from 0.69 to 0.82 when compared with jersey number recognition only.","['Sebastian Gerke', 'Antje Linnemann', 'Karsten Muller']",8077e592-69bb-400c-8a93-cf3adea681de,0,"['0063b640-385d-4136-adea-1a82c5b97c27', '220b4db1-a76b-460a-a0b4-3e43d1494e08', '3219dd87-2679-4ea8-8869-5b98c9595e87', '414b3860-1d05-43cb-9761-4c42accbda6d', '45424798-69fc-46db-b643-254ec8b93431', '45d992f9-f92c-4761-bea9-4bd6d1eb6b1d', '47ee6919-50dd-49df-bd1d-800caf9fd8d4', '5e715fb1-e8cb-4928-9b47-24e48c83ef8a', '9e256bcd-4844-4edf-a237-3bb3cff70564', 'b35f9dc3-0f39-46b0-ae00-10d224bbc4be', 'b4283431-c6fd-46f7-8cf6-cafe4b45d840', 'b9f93bb7-280f-442f-aa48-8b3b925f7e56', 'c32b444a-02d1-45c1-a08f-e2c05c6c50f4', 'c3e5f8f4-b96e-470f-a091-a017797309d8', 'ec15fd43-fe25-4ac5-b75f-b8fd9f48c730', 'ec1c7f8e-546c-4d70-8646-73d5f7a2cd62', 'f43b60c1-70bc-4320-b8ee-c8f1a058cccb', 'f6819036-7caf-4c78-a25d-b7c71b5ce21c']",Soccer Player Recognition using Spatial Constellation Features and Jersey Number Recognition,Computer Vision and Image Understanding,2017
1094,"Quantum Annealing was previously applied to the vehicle routing problem and the results were promising. For all benchmark instances in the study, optimal results were obtained. However, 100% success rate was not achieved in every case, and tuning the control parameters for larger instances proved cumbersome. This work addresses these remaining difficulties. An empirical approach is taken wherein measurements of run-time behaviour are exploited to transform existing good values of control parameters so that they can be used successfully for other problem instances. The course of this work shows a method which simplifies hand-tuning so that the heuristic performs successfully when applied to larger instances, and also demonstrates a tuning method which establishes control parameter values for instances which belong in broadly defined groupings. In addition, new best known solutions for large-scale instances, and initial results for the distance-constrained variant of the vehicle routing problem are presented.","['Alex Syrichas', 'Alan Crispin']",bf5f6212-072f-4199-8303-301e8a5178ca,0,"['1c8092c4-2f56-4ef1-b048-62cd3c2bb934', '2c751d31-f0e6-47cc-bffb-9e82c21a5e6a', '317a79dc-968d-4f0c-a119-63ea70980c69', '4d225699-672e-4601-b646-83e12147ad22', '63779611-5e92-492a-917d-14e708582e16', '712274b5-8d12-4d49-8b8d-2213eab9196d', '7561dede-b0dd-4001-81fd-48c25b9fc91f', 'acb990fe-febd-4911-9181-cc0e31f3416e', 'af1b7acd-cab7-4fe2-88c3-1679f5ac7fba', 'bd1b668d-c471-4b20-a4ba-96838f1360ca', 'e4b522c3-24df-4eca-a26d-3d5e5b87fb43']","Large-scale vehicle routing problems: Quantum Annealing, tunings and results",Computers & Operations Research,2017

1096,"To detect salient regions in images, a widely accepted practice is to construct a graph on the image elements, and then assign a saliency value to each node in the graph according to its distance to a number of initial seeds. Two problems emerge in this procedure, i.e., generating the initial seeds and propagating the saliency values. In this work, a scheme for selecting the initial seeds is introduced. A linear model is learned to predict the confidence of assigning a superpixel to the foreground or to the background, and then an adaptive thresholding method is adopted to generate reliable foreground and background seeds, from which the saliency value is propagated in the diffusion procedure. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated on several saliency detection datasets, and improved results are observed compared with a number of the state of the art methods.","['Sanyuan Zhao', 'Zhengchao Lei', 'Meiling Sun', 'Ao Ma', 'Jianbing Shen']",2b463e6a-732a-41dc-8f14-bc90d1854821,0,"['00d8f784-1171-4fe6-afeb-987bc0097d0d', '092c559f-25b9-4964-9052-cdeebe6f5ce1', '0e9f3a11-4b26-40e3-8dd1-f4bf4a129e2e', '1049fe32-c8ba-40ca-b813-6a1a8aef1998', '24082e6e-1750-49a1-ada3-f0fe1d65cd4b', '2ad60ebb-8eb4-44bb-ac54-731d63a30c61', '2b9c537e-9026-4e46-8639-68231019d67a', '3027f131-be54-43d2-9352-c13ad3b14af8', '4b9c17d1-9a08-48a2-95e0-47d3d4452a96', '4bbf4b9a-2742-470e-838c-83ae7d3112a0', '4c25c8bf-8625-416c-9cf1-d8c076f997a3', '4cbd7765-c47a-4004-a5f8-c2da7c7d1c7b', '4f363ea7-961a-4d6b-9512-3644b2700804', '58632519-4306-4b71-9343-d392554f6713', '5a7c9d23-6d10-431b-92af-541e4bbb86e3', '5ae8bac5-6cbc-4691-a3c0-4ecdd37c3575', '6d121e97-e351-4cf9-8c44-d7ab3ce9d9fe', '8ff8ac0f-e442-4b4a-9fa4-6be97b89016c', '92f24f9d-b487-452b-9d0f-ec626d42096a', 'a261d167-9265-4ca7-b354-76b464c98ad6', 'a325dbe0-ff47-445d-a21d-8dcedbc33919', 'a79af813-aaf3-4b00-a63b-2ddfadb81c41', 'aacc9251-8e66-44e8-802a-8fb655225d18', 'c14f68cc-7e5b-498b-9523-edf1fa8c8643', 'c26fbb22-7001-4691-b485-ee2fa565b249', 'c5741249-ac74-4936-bff9-533a97610f8f', 'd38d44b3-51d6-408f-8190-6fc14b6da96c', 'd4891943-4694-4ee0-907f-b04ef6d85815', 'd71c8076-3180-4d83-9195-1aba01a2a19f', 'db41affb-36f1-4729-97fb-82c9e43c0985', 'deb5bb26-91ca-495b-9a8f-5ebb8633c4e8', 'dfe3b949-0e67-4b6c-8f47-d220b979e17b', 'e21099c3-0707-46f1-8819-74b8abac23a9', 'eef2b4cd-ebe4-43cf-94ee-535d665f7d96', 'ef29f130-8d3d-408d-a5ef-00e3cb9051f3', 'f2b3c62c-c13d-45e8-a92a-7604adb21b43', 'f718291e-c799-4c7f-ac83-cb099bf9ab58', 'fd14fab9-2ad3-4bb8-9d1b-285c62bbeeb2']",Diffusion-based saliency detection with optimal seed selection scheme,Neurocomputing,2017

Whole-genome regression models in Bayesian framework represent the main family of prediction methods. Fitting such models with a large number of observations involves a prohibitive computational burden. We propose the use of subsampling bootstrap Markov chain in genomic prediction. Such method consists of fitting whole-genome regression models by subsampling observations in each round of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We evaluated the effect of subsampling bootstrap on prediction and computational parameters.,"['Alencar Xavier', 'Shizhong Xu', 'W. M.

1099,"Semantic gap, which refers to the limitation that low-level hand-crafted visual features insufficiently encode high-level semantic concepts contained in the images, has been a challenging issue in image retrieval and significantly impairs the performance of real-world retrieval systems. Despite massive efforts that have been devoted to developing effective image signatures, e.g., Bag-of-Visual-Words (BOVW), the Fisher Vector (FV) and the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), these mid-level image features still fail to handle the problem of semantic gap and thus lead to suboptimal results. Towards this end, a large body of work focuses on introducing attribute learning into a variety of vision applications. As inherent nature that describes the intrinsic properties of objects, such as color, shape and rigidity, learned attributes serve as intermediate representations that bridge the semantic gap. However, conventional attribute embedding methods are generally developed for image global representation while ignoring local spatial cues, which prevents them from achieving desirable performance. In this paper, we attempt to encode weak spatial information into attribute embedding for effective image retrieval. Specifically, we partition the image into regular grids and extract Classemes attribute vector from each patch, which results in a large pool of Classemes descriptors followed by VLAD aggregation for generating holistic representation. In order to produce a compact and discriminative code, we employ a piecewise Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) for dimension reduction and concatenate all the compressed Classemes into a single vector coined Spatially Pooled Attributes (SPA). Thorough experimental evaluation and comparative study on three public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach.","['Jun Li', 'Chang Xu', 'Wankou Yang', 'Changyin Sun']",32184bb8-3bde-443e-86f4-c42b669e50f2,50,"['06546bec-4d27-4ecf-a0ff-c96571dfec5f', '06b2a168-3473-4225-a61b-d03c93028136', '082aab37-366f-4fd2-bec0-55afd77d1f5d', '096b2319-7282-4964-9136-52bc12348bc3', '0d43d749-4606-4e64-904a-575b3e762b3c', '11dfdff9-7680-489f-a30f-96198eccff31', '1bd2029f-3807-4cfa-a9d3-5774748f6b14', '1fe06ec6-c5cb-4800-ba8f-4ea907fcba06', '2170ea6b-43b8-4849-9d4c-b6a9ab1bdf54', '285dd088-2a2f-46cb-8d9d-294951c79b0d', '292bf0c4-63d9-49ec-b92c-c80af3981a2f', '3daf5a32-5275-4c48-ae25-cd47cfec0f33', '3dc2b095-2715-4c74-a212-22728d0c98c3', '459b6b32-71bc-46a6-ad57-08de5834310c', '4928aa7c-c5fd-465a-b46d-b35a764953e1', '4e20f374-db4e-4c9e-ba2b-6b1af2a4b9c3', '5922611d-9333-486f-9eeb-1d8c063c99f2', '59e5e0b0-db01-438e-8763-319477f9baf1', '5ce96df8-fc29-4a00-a7b5-4851f1accc36', '5e8b5954-3bf3-49f7-82b7-28b89d0c1a8f', '5f290b18-d3c6-452d-966b-c8a11e88a5f6', '617f2e21-1bc2-4ca1-bace-df8f47644284', '66faae6c-042e-464d-8cf3-1e5539e54e48', '6c38b3b4-7562-493d-a40c-fe70abf039a7', '77d602c2-1de3-4287-b550-b0baf82eaa53', '7883590f-66ea-4652-9970-f94c92a7e38f', '7e279ff4-6409-4809-b29a-61e7663fd794', '7f738a4b-b56b-4ac6-a44c-abfb91b4433d', '81163e27-8feb-48e0-b21b-a69d8555e64c', '83c0d01f-aa42-49ff-97d5-777d9b4c658b', '89cb2b9b-77e3-4581-b9ca-fbb7d18dab55', '8b2a5047-0b1f-4059-8213-7dea34c7e3d2', '8b44d8a4-5527-4883-bb99-e1c57d4b1e9c', '8f118527-4456-4c89-9971-32dc73083928', '8f44b348-c43b-4fae-ada5-aef268b27650', '9270a9b5-940a-4394-814f-433c6440f286', '9837abf2-827f-45e7-9d4c-033402cc2fa6', '98c3a1b5-9fb9-4342-8db3-cb16a068f344', 'a165729d-f327-4223-8f10-2ee13e1139fd', 'a6c3fae4-e8b4-4883-8523-21bb8d7a125c', 'ab3afb93-8ca0-4556-ae60-11199dc263c2', 'b0d9eb59-4849-4f7c-bf71-da13289377f2', 'b19db595-91d0-460b-ae23-5ed027879c51', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'ba9f4816-bcd8-42bc-9384-223612b793ac', 'c3985fb5-1295-4ccb-9793-fbbbbdb9b011', 'c5032184-f463-4105-9de7-651c11002e89', 'cdc02fb4-3f91-45b3-8e00-1f10fd1e515a', 'd0697e1c-8d74-4d42-a767-af849994044f', 'd1bf1bdd-1755-4d94-9162-60a6cafe675c', 'd8510004-ed30-4201-ac78-b836fac1a7bb', 'dc1d12f5-b9f0-4425-b6ec-1eb018aed956', 'e0ac4812-7729-4a2d-8a1f-74b1b7c8eb5d', 'e1c96470-96dc-4d4b-8c08-7ca83030cdbf', 'e2204e92-e6dc-4884-9bbc-200029491fc7', 'e32ebd88-42f8-4915-a5f7-098047d344fd', 'e6b9f7f4-4c7d-43cb-942f-5c501542cc76', 'ecc286b4-ee53-473f-8fbc-f07c56f8f3d3', 'f1bb9e3f-7b62-493a-adcc-d6241dfb13e2', 'f7cb06a5-a473-4e00-806c-170546e8d985', 'faf1d751-b559-4522-bf50-6d88a04d8bd1', 'fbdfc1ca-09ef-47f8-a0d1-adaf626a8562', 'fc20031b-176a-4a76-80dd-d70cd647d63f']",SPA: Spatially Pooled Attributes for image retrieval,Neurocomputing,2017

1101,"Filtering belongs to the most fundamental operations of retinal image processing and for which the value of the filtered image at a given location is a function of the values in a local window centered at this location. However, preserving thin retinal vessels during the filtering process is challenging due to vessels’ small area and weak contrast compared to background, caused by the limited resolution of imaging and less blood flow in the vessel. In this paper, we present a novel retinal image denoising approach which is able to preserve the details of retinal vessels while effectively eliminating image noise. Specifically, our approach is carried out by determining an optimal spatial kernel for the bilateral filter, which is represented by a line spread function with an orientation and scale adjusted adaptively to the local vessel structure. Moreover, this approach can also be served as a preprocessing tool for improving the accuracy of the vessel detection technique. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art image denoising techniques such as the bilateral filter.","['Yunlong He', 'Yuanjie Zheng', 'Yanna Zhao', 'Yanju Ren', 'Jian Lian', 'James C.

Firstly, for the equivalent channel model with each transmitter having only two antennas, the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRMax) problem is reformulated with newly defined angle variables. Then, a centralized weighted leakage-plus-noise-to-signal ratio minimization (WLNSRMin) algorithm is proposed to find a locally optimal weighted sum-rate point. Each step of the algorithm is solved by evaluating closed-form expressions. A distributed algorithm is also given to avoid the exchange of the channel state information (CSI) between transmitters. Numerical results show that the centralized WLNSRMin algorithm converges to a local optimum of the WSRMax problem after a few iterations and the distributed algorithm achieves a performance very close to that of the centralized algorithm with only local CSI.","['Jiamin Li', 'Dongming Wang', 'Pengcheng Zhu', 'Jiangzhou Wang', 'Xiaohu You']",74c42662-beb8-406e-92e0-cc65449a0207,0,"['14b400e5-7b84-416a-8600-c871866f1a19', '1f3ea3bd-e654-4e5b-9dd0-a0b665592161', '1fe6054c-d1c0-4bc2-8c49-4e60e69e37b0', '414494f9-fa46-4ec5-a18d-470b938fae2d', '5fefa5eb-2a5b-43ab-b15c-dfa36e43b65a', '6c3a52fa-244f-431c-b057-3afc4e1059fa', '6e5edb69-81b6-4301-83a5-b3f43a882615', 'bc6f7a4f-6dbc-45f9-be4e-c0dd552cc28d', 'd87c28af-1277-4b08-82ff-561d5dfeebdc', 'e12e23ce-a2aa-46de-88b8-6095926caff2', 'e37eca8e-3468-4850-89d5-2b3f7408004a', 'e88453f0-cce2-4bcd-907e-f3f55759d1cd']","Optimality Properties, Closed-Form Parameterizations and Distributed Strategy of the Two-User MISO Interference Channel",Wireless Personal Communications,2017

1104,"Ebola is a highly infectious disease generally characterized by sporadic outbreaks. A deterministic Ebola model is formulated and converted into Ito stochastic differential equations by adding noise on each compartment. In order to estimate the model parameter values, we use the extended Kalman filter technique as the filtering method and sum of square of errors to compute an approximation of the likelihood. From the obtained likelihood function, the maximum likelihood and MCMC methods for parameters estimation are then used. These parameter estimates provide useful information on quantities of epidemiological interest. Two cases are analyzed: (1) the model error covariance is set to be zero and (2) the bias is fully incorporated into the model. A comparison between these two cases is carried out to assess whether the bias is having a measure effect on parameters and states estimation. Finally, we investigate whether an estimate obtained from a biased study differs systematically from the true source population of the study. Our results indicate that the more the increase of bias, the more the noise in states simulation and parameters estimation compared to the deterministic model.","['Denis Ndanguza', 'I. S.

Most of the evolutionary algorithms faces the problem of getting trapped in local optima in its search for global optimum solutions. This is highly influenced by the use of random sequences by different operators in these algorithms along their run. The proposed algorithm replaces random sequences by chaotic sequences mitigating the problem of premature convergence. Experiments were conducted to investigate the efficiency of 10 defined chaotic maps and the best one was chosen. Performance of the proposed Chaotic Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (CDPSO) algorithm is compared with chaotic variants of optimization algorithms like Cuckoo Search, Harmony Search, Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization exploiting the chosen optimal chaotic map. Various histogram thresholding measures like minimum cross entropy and Tsallis entropy were used as objective functions and implemented for satellite image segmentation scenario. The experimental results are validated qualitatively and quantitatively by evaluating the mean, standard deviation of the fitness values, PSNR, MSE, SSIM and the total time required for the execution of each optimization algorithm.","['Shilpa Suresh', 'Shyam Lal']",077c2a99-facb-45ab-8469-2ca3ed306a99,0,"['0cf723ed-2d0b-4def-b92d-65e3fa0a8732', '125e38da-46f8-4083-8d61-8cc7644bc941', '14c52408-9072-483b-b431-f1c08f336149', '19b5b860-702b-4f62-b783-72bd812a9fbd', '1bc6d62f-0b65-4a99-a18a-0ea784ea73ce', '233be687-224f-458a-9071-9d021cbe559e', '2e575ad0-325b-425a-b275-532fadf2155d', '3ae8a4fc-f9a2-4dc3-9dac-3e1960e4b8be', '3c2a51ca-1ed9-41eb-8038-16f5a6cd8684', '44841dd7-301e-4c59-9137-ea3dfe48d612', '4848a349-18f6-4d30-a9df-68cd2007bc72', '4c982886-3e84-4007-a947-27ba0b01cef6', '575a40a0-f4e0-426e-a01d-636058690c17', '6937b500-1f70-4504-a740-02456f54c401', '7680c222-813b-4449-bc06-19e09ced545f', '772f284f-d5ef-44f0-9e33-f8c8fe25312a', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '81347ae3-7026-4848-8f75-b00f58b0ced6', '8b55f725-e0e4-4674-8f8e-098634628b58', '8dffc0a5-9624-464c-81fb-da76f32a35a6', '9a525732-6489-48e3-bd5b-3276d09dee75', '9bceec06-ba05-4d70-b8e0-ec7ab8944c6b', 'a2a0d7ee-8fa9-46fe-9e0b-a2f3702e9af4', 'bc0def26-6726-424e-a3f6-4a126664bfd3', 'c2efc441-b7da-409b-a724-99391f4611c4', 'c5262bff-cc79-4a2a-aa6d-523812410dab', 'de1a02eb-0a29-4c8a-bfaa-bcc630ab9905', 'e19d463e-eba8-4c05-b952-c55e26027d60', 'e4b468aa-2b23-4229-8872-f9286464a19f', 'ec28b97f-b611-4017-b26c-8be759f0ef83', 'ee9f1c4e-f75b-46f6-be42-67e3d2a5e875', 'f214487d-9c2d-4aac-8fdc-acd7e72b7ede', 'f3755c33-4149-48ca-bf0e-ae0ca2147911', 'f864d54c-9192-4f83-8b4c-e9db8004cd24', 'f91735de-6a1f-4441-a517-8fd0e27beb93', 'faccd99e-c62f-477e-8cda-4333015e4400']",Multilevel thresholding based on Chaotic Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization for segmentation of satellite images,Applied Soft Computing,2017
1107,"Outage probabilities are important measures of the performance of wireless communication systems, but to obtain outage probabilities it is necessary to first determine detailed system parameters, followed by complicated calculations. When there are multiple candidates of diversity techniques applicable for a system, the diversity order can be used to roughly but quickly compare the techniques for a wide range of operating environments. For a system transmitting over frequency selective fading channels, the diversity order can be defined as the number of multi-paths if multi-paths have all equal energy. However, diversity order may not be adequately defined when the energy values are different. In order to obtain a rough value of diversity order, one may use the number of multi-paths or the reciprocal value of the multi-path energy variance. Such definitions are not very useful for evaluating the performance of diversity techniques since the former is meaningful only when the target outage probability is extremely small, while the latter is reasonable when the target outage probability is very large. In this paper, we propose a new definition of diversity order for frequency selective fading channels. The proposed scheme is based on Renyi entropy, which is widely used in biology and many other fields. We provide various simulation results to show that the diversity order using the proposed definition is tightly correlated with the corresponding outage probability, and thus the proposed scheme can be used for quickly selecting the best diversity technique among multiple candidates.","['Seungyeob Chae', 'Minjoong Rim']",dd03fcd6-1788-49d5-b275-a9872c69b97f,0,"['089083c7-0967-4fef-a935-1f378d815d06', '1a9ebe93-a1d1-44f1-987b-d1b6047bf2ae', '29f4c12a-5847-4f30-8e23-3db9e326bd00', '4f82f574-1054-4621-8cb4-3467d7928b3a', '6b2fdefe-b8a0-455d-a0c3-1e8e5916b152', '9301a22f-db52-483f-a824-8504a207b78e', 'a567a3b3-e519-4965-ae3c-5e6ce00dab9a', 'b0c0cebf-991f-4f49-b4ea-46bd412caba9']",On the Definition of Diversity Order Based on Renyi Entropy for Frequency Selective Fading Channels,Entropy,2017

1109,"Structuring problems for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has attracted increasing attention over the past 20 years from both a conceptual and a practical perspective. This is reflected in a significant growth in the number of published applications which use a formal approach to problem structuring in combination with an analytic method for multi-criteria analysis. The problem structuring approaches (PSMs) include general methodologies such as Checkland's Soft Systems Method (SSM), Eden and Ackermann's Strategic Options Design and Analysis (SODA) and other methods that focus on a particular aspect. We carried out a literature review that covers eight PSMs (Cognitive and Causal Maps, DPSIR, Scenario Planning, SSM, Stakeholder Analysis, Strategic Choice Approach, SODA and SWOT) and seven MCDA methods (AHP, ANP, ELECTRE, MAUT, MAVT, PROMETHEE and TOPSIS). We first identified and analysed 333 articles published during 2000-2015, then selected 68 articles covering all PSM-MCDA combinations, which were studied in detail to understand the associated processes, benefits and challenges. The three PSMs most commonly combined with MCDA are SWOT, Scenario Planning and DPSIR. AHP was by far the most commonly applied MCDA method. Combining PSMs with MCDA produces a richer view of the decision situation and enables more effective support for different phases of the decision-making process. Some limitations and challenges in combining PSMs and MCDA are also identified, most importantly relating to building a value tree and assigning criteria weights.","['Mika Marttunen', 'Judit Lienert', 'Valerie Belton']",1df5fd12-cb6b-487b-acea-338f3009cdcd,0,"['0eb822dd-7986-4401-9f6b-596fb9581df1', '0ec0698a-bf4a-40d1-8e64-253ee231c997', '11a8f67f-7fdb-4414-8232-d4ac2b1d5a3c', '1b609f5e-1b5f-407d-a954-557cd753e8b0', '34fec18a-a146-4e40-9ef7-2a447624542b', '3bcfe282-6afd-43ca-b548-c23f0c8838d6', '469904f6-904d-4af7-8369-22a88f9cccb9', '49eb6217-7911-4c7f-8f1c-1ab537bbd412', '4b2ed576-ba12-4749-9257-77788d1c2424', '53e5f775-08ee-4fe7-9452-d2a8206e9645', '562c9368-ed8f-4fed-a2b8-f9ce3abb07a3', '5fc534cc-dfde-4eac-9c9c-4e561e032eb6', '615dad31-4455-426d-9800-ad4d6fc1f045', '628e9f5b-d79c-4202-be62-a974c2266dfc', '634a46c1-5526-4013-be15-f2aa01416ab1', '6b60cd16-950b-4bd2-8be7-cd235bdf50d7', '6f4f9961-7a76-4326-b035-ac16e4b2d9f7', '70fd914f-9817-48f7-8d9a-7df6d33b5582', '776e13f7-1c0f-473c-a012-9e488affb5ec', '7ac09fff-8c01-40b4-9fe6-5b5db9c4a8f7', '90245040-4045-442d-b6e2-66ec72b5443f', 'a64de2a1-666c-43a1-add8-a006bc87e1b9', 'aa243c36-32ee-4844-932e-10b8b04837fe', 'aa62dfc9-9298-4110-8fe6-139ec7f65040', 'b6e8cc1c-858f-46d1-9dc2-85415f3d18d5', 'c2ebcfa2-c7a1-485b-9b3b-2caf1f12ab46', 'c82c2e50-4d9a-49b2-b6cd-d627ad75e3c2', 'cba87ac1-c1dc-4247-9943-7d60fae160f6', 'd0e212c1-2c08-4861-a0dc-fa29096bee6e', 'de4c8c56-a6a9-4318-8e3e-6c19bd1f2435', 'e665c3ce-3fc9-4be1-ae75-24e546a1c095', 'ee85a2e2-5654-4417-8a2e-5ddc39610929', 'ff7ab607-ec95-4c95-a6ed-72566a0f2eaa']",Structuring problems for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis in Practice: A Literature Review of Method Combinations,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
1110,"In this paper, a hybrid learning approach, which combines the extreme learning machine (ELM) with a new switching delayed PSO (SDPSO) algorithm, is proposed for the problem of the short-term load forecasting (STLF). In particular, the input weights and biases of ELM are optimized by a new developed SDPSO algorithm, where the delayed information of locally best particle and globally best particle are exploited to update the velocity of particle. By testing the proposed SDPSO-ELM in a comprehensive manner on a tanh function, this approach obtain better generalization performance and can also avoid adding unnecessary hidden nodes and overtraining problems. Moreover, it has shown outstanding performance than other state-of-the-art ELMs. Finally, the proposed SDPSO-ELM algorithm is successfully applied to the STLF of power system. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed learning algorithm can get better forecasting results in comparison with the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) algorithm.","['Nianyin Zeng', 'Hong Zhang', 'Weibo Liu', 'Jinling Liang', 'Fuad E.

1111,"Ensemble forecasting is a widely-used numerical prediction method for modeling the evolution of nonlinear dynamic systems. To predict the future state of such systems, a set of ensemble member forecasts is generated from multiple runs of computer models, where each run is obtained by perturbing the starting condition or using a different model representation of the system. The ensemble mean or median is typically chosen as a point estimate for the ensemble member forecasts. These approaches are limited in that they assume each ensemble member is equally skillful and may not preserve the temporal autocorrelation of the predicted time series. To overcome these limitations, we present an online multi-task learning framework called  ORION  to estimate the optimal weights for combining the ensemble member forecasts. Unlike other existing formulations, the proposed framework is novel in that its learning algorithm must backtrack and revise its previous forecasts before making future predictions if the earlier forecasts were incorrect when verified against new observation data. We termed this strategy as  online learning with restart . Our proposed framework employs a graph Laplacian regularizer to ensure consistency of the predicted time series. It can also accommodate different types of loss functions, including    $\epsilon$      -insensitive and quantile loss functions, the latter of which is particularly useful for extreme value prediction. A theoretical proof demonstrating the convergence of our algorithm is also given. Experimental results on seasonal soil moisture forecasts from 12 major river basins in North America demonstrate the superiority of ORION compared to other baseline algorithms.","['Jianpeng Xu', 'Pang-Ning Tan', 'Jiayu Zhou', 'Lifeng Luo']",e155a50c-7500-47ba-b561-24cc76ca98e9,0,"['0a424512-f236-4ecf-9b59-92053149be54', '0f464c88-30bd-48ea-8e2f-0cefc37cea24', '16e82df7-2b6d-49e7-9bd9-facfe57c7070', '3134175f-6211-4ce0-9667-d7556610a4d9', '33e43ef2-5fe2-4392-a325-69691b2f2bc2', '3ce7f0e3-544b-4b87-86f6-9872ee5a5b2a', '48005cec-7370-4a4e-9a5e-273a9b921aa3', '59ed1be7-1ca1-46f5-b12b-04636cb7e7ee', '66718594-05da-4e41-b107-5fb66ca1b760', '69d34993-7c1d-4693-a950-eb417bde95ff', '739659a7-5aa8-49de-8cbc-f7d9c3b405e7', '75daefc9-df12-4f97-a595-5fa69629fd74', '7e7d58c5-5fa6-43e5-bcbb-b5cc3e00a771', '8174e527-3df7-4e5d-8883-10f4d0327448', '8350948e-d7ff-4e8b-9d83-d1c301f75133', '85f46ca0-9876-4c1d-a6db-3e24bd0e2aaa', '8d6f4ee1-3c40-46c1-ae5c-11bcad3cf112', '9226a3c8-5e9d-4983-9e98-390d732901a5', '9e9230f4-a2cc-4a65-bd29-305cac0cdbe9', 'a1cb2962-f5f0-4a56-a46a-fbba7977692d', 'a55a6f80-d58f-4985-a5d6-4804f10f3e96', 'a9ba4a9d-bc12-4218-a66b-867ece6e1746', 'b0a7a3f3-6d85-415c-9cc4-54dbd3aecd16', 'b63e6258-259a-4800-9d9a-28cb22c43f79', 'c5138491-5f5d-4fef-9bd2-8a9de24fb1fc', 'c9eeb84f-7c5f-4201-8943-7b71b3b2fdeb', 'd551aaa2-f79d-42fc-b37f-5cd91cba0c87', 'eb4b2757-f700-4640-8911-1fa54f47a919', 'ece833d4-067a-4250-b70d-a5056e2093c4', 'fb79f19e-9e57-4c5b-86a3-8f8556fdc081']",Online Multi-Task Learning Framework for Ensemble Forecasting,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017

Our main result is that, in a certain class of voting systems based on pairwise comparisons of alternatives, the RCVS is the only one to be Condorcet-proof. By Condorcet-proof, we mean that, when a Condorcet winner exists, it must be selected and no voter has incentives to misreport his preferences. We also prove two theorems about group-strategy-proofness. On one hand, we prove that there is no group-strategy-proof voting system that always selects existing Condorcet winners.

1114,"A non-local means (NLM) filter is a weighted average of a large number of non-local pixels with various image intensity values. The NLM filters have been shown to have powerful denoising performance, excellent detail preservation by averaging many noisy pixels, and using appropriate values for the weights, respectively. The NLM weights between two different pixels are determined based on the similarities between two patches that surround these pixels and a smoothing parameter. Another important factor that influences the denoising performance is the self-weight values for the same pixel. The recently introduced local James-Stein type center pixel weight estimation method (LJS) outperforms other existing methods when determining the contribution of the center pixels in the NLM filter. However, the LJS method may result in excessively large self-weight estimates since no upper bound is assumed, and the method uses a relatively large local area for estimating the self-weights, which may lead to a strong bias. In this paper, we investigated these issues in the LJS method, and then propose a novel local self-weight estimation methods using direct bounds (LMM-DB) and reparametrization (LMM-RP) based on the Baranchik’s minimax estimator. Both the LMM-DB and LMM-RP methods were evaluated using a wide range of natural images and a clinical MRI image together with the various levels of additive Gaussian noise. Our proposed parameter selection methods yielded an improved bias-variance trade-off, a higher peak signal-to-noise (PSNR) ratio, and fewer visual artifacts when compared with the results of the classical NLM and LJS methods. Our proposed methods also provide a heuristic way to select a suitable global smoothing parameters that can yield PSNR values that are close to the optimal values.","['Minh Phuong Nguyen', 'Se Young Chun']",a8bd6877-3c11-4af3-987e-7b5951acf204,0,"['03259e89-12b2-4c90-80e5-8517ca992809', '0c32535a-72bb-4fda-b12b-627147f8b358', '2ab2e314-9a1a-407d-8036-ebfd846a2847', '3010b25b-5f2c-4f37-8344-a38be9d09686', '328b9427-87cb-44c0-85e0-277685116a24', '35b15630-3369-4496-b574-94e12fd0089e', '39c5a221-8ba9-4cc8-8ca1-1a3981811285', '3cd93110-144c-4ed0-bacc-96430eb9c117', '3d90055d-6a77-4b99-b2d1-9340d76cac21', '43b15ae1-2af4-42fd-b4b4-55dabd1181bf', '46f8e0f1-d971-43d0-8187-6dd77cdab95d', '49de5bee-594c-4404-92ef-a57b1c41a768', '4b05f8f7-5686-41f9-aa99-b210c46e9fb4', '58b6a2d5-1352-4098-9110-4b0ed0175757', '5bf46fa7-6fbf-4114-9c6c-ae99e8908f8c', '65b41780-e423-49f0-b543-b91181d9098e', '855e170d-1e4b-45e7-9fc2-aa2cc1ed5e93', '882d91a5-e7ee-4c5b-a9dc-147fa3151f1d', '9cdd9abf-71c7-4c80-9539-5f33e0a7b938', '9ea94e61-18fd-4681-b330-eaa1a52c0496', 'ae365c25-dc06-4b80-9b67-4ecb96509214', 'b402a14d-eccb-46be-99c5-03af50580b62', 'b608af66-6368-44dc-a670-2a3e42561ee1', 'c7e81023-78f2-4ee3-aa3b-53d8e55c2bf0', 'cef6a93e-1058-460a-a1e4-d7d74374b5e0', 'cfa27fb5-7543-4ff4-b042-f13b8b9c6155', 'd558204c-8b4f-473c-a801-a6921d1cf0e9', 'da66e310-d1c2-4487-82fc-d80868a9ce40', 'ddcb36d7-73cb-45a0-a116-35ce4d2ce72d']",Bounded Self-Weights Estimation Method for Non-Local Means Image Denoising Using Minimax Estimators,IEEE Transactions on Image Processing,2017
1115,"A computational method for direct simulation of the generation and propagation of blood flow induced sounds is proposed. This computational hemoacoustic method is based on the immersed boundary approach and employs high-order finite difference methods to resolve wave propagation and scattering accurately. The current method employs a two-step, one-way coupled approach for the sound generation and its propagation through the tissue. The blood flow is simulated by solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using the sharp-interface immersed boundary method, and the equations corresponding to the generation and propagation of the three-dimensional elastic wave corresponding to the murmur are resolved with a high-order, immersed boundary based, finite-difference methods in the time-domain. The proposed method is applied to a model problem of aortic stenosis murmur and the simulation results are verified and validated by comparing with known solutions as well as experimental measurements. The murmur propagation in a realistic model of a human thorax is also simulated by using the computational method. The roles of hemodynamics and elastic wave propagation on the murmur are discussed based on the simulation results.","['Jung Hee Seo', 'Hani Bakhshaee', 'Guillaume Garreau', 'Chi Zhu', 'Andreas G.

1117,"This paper proposes a novel model for mining patterns including dynamic function clustering, segmentation, and forecasting values of dependent variables simultaneously. The proposed Dependent Dirichlet Process Piecewise Regression Mixture (DDPPRM) model is capable of handling dynamic nature of data by detecting evolving clusters at each time step. This evolution manifests dynamically in three states of clusters: newly created, existing, and transient states of clusters. The model is also able to generate clusters over time infinitely. It is capable of learning the optimal number of clusters rather than using the fixed, predefined clusters. However, other clustering methods such as Fuzzy C-Regression Model and Piecewise Regression Mixture technique support none of those capabilities. The proposed model is also capable of showing regime changes and segmenting functions in regression/time series problems. A two-step Gibbs sampling method is utilized for assigning data to clusters. Expectation-Maximization method is used for finding the optimal values of parameters of functions and probability distributions. The model is validated by using some numerical experiments and calculating three validity indexes as well as Mean Square Error of the model. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other clustering, segmentation, and forecasting models in literature.","['R. Gamasaee', 'M. H.

1118,"Digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) is a refinement of the conventional PCR approach to nucleic acid detection and absolute quantification. Digital PCR works by partitioning a sample of DNA or cDNA into many individual, parallel PCR reactions. Current quantification methods rely on the assumption that the PCR reactions are always able to detect single target molecules. When the assumption does not hold, the copy numbers will be severely underestimated. We developed a novel dPCR quantification method which determines whether the single copy assumption is violated or not by simultaneously estimating the assay sensitivity and the copy numbers using serial dilution data sets. The implemented method is available as an R package “digitalPCR”.","['Xutao Deng', 'Brian Custer', 'Michael P.

1119,"The B and T cells of the human adaptive immune system leverage a highly diverse repertoire of antigen-specific receptors to protect the human body from pathogens. The sequencing and analysis of immune repertoires is emerging as an important tool to understand immune responses, whether beneficial or harmful (in the case of autoimmunity). However, methods for studying these repertoires, and for directly comparing different immune repertoires, are lacking. In this paper, we present a non-parametric method for directly comparing sequencing repertoires, with the goal of rigorously quantifying differences in V, D, and J gene segment utilization. This method, referred to as the Repertoire Dissimilarity Index (RDI), uses a bootstrapped subsampling approach to account for variance in sequencing depth, and, coupled with a data simulation approach, allows for direct quantification of the average variation between repertoires. We use the RDI method to recapitulate known differences in the formation of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell repertoires, and further show that antigen-driven activation of naive CD8+ T cells is more selective than in the CD4+ repertoire, resulting in a more specialized CD8+ memory repertoire. We prove that the RDI method is an accurate and versatile method for comparisons of immune repertoires. The RDI method has been implemented as an R package, and is available for download through Bitbucket.","['Christopher R. Bolen', 'Florian Rubelt', 'Jason A. Vander Heiden', 'Mark M.

1120,"We present a new graph-based method, called discrete geodesic graph (DGG), to compute discrete geodesics in a divide-and-conquer manner. Let M be a manifold triangle mesh with n   vertices and e>0e>0 the given accuracy parameter. Assume the vertices are uniformly distributed on the input mesh. We show that the DGG associated to M   has O(ne) edges and the shortest path distances on the graph approximate geodesic distances on M   with relative error O(e)O(e). Computational results show that the actual error is less than 0.6e on common models. Taking advantage of DGG's unique features, we develop a DGG-tailored label-correcting algorithm that computes geodesic distances in empirically linear time. With DGG, we can guarantee the computed distances are true distance metrics, which is highly desired in many applications. We observe that DGG significantly outperforms saddle vertex graph (SVG) – another graph based method for discrete geodesics – in terms of graph size, accuracy control and runtime performance.","['Xiaoning Wang', 'Zheng Fang', 'Jiajun Wu', 'Shi-Qing Xin', 'Ying He']",a4ece664-2d90-4848-b71d-bf247075abfb,50,"['05920766-33a0-4b88-97f6-c4517a9cf2a3', '0acd19bc-a5e7-414e-a62e-014c5ea9028d', '0d655a84-4549-4e7f-9b43-8182cc41c218', '2377e7ff-b1ab-47d3-baac-6c7ddd597b43', '2b5051e6-6e1b-4169-a8b1-9ff2c5b26f97', '45c24504-9d9a-475b-9707-2ef8f1d1928a', '5f4f37ec-f3de-464c-abcf-fe995fe5d772', '7096fdc5-d186-4d04-96a0-af535c943018', '7162b140-cdd7-4d10-895d-fbb22fe69a6c', '7aa52a41-9b8d-4993-a8c9-62280f494e4f', '7af4600e-2aa8-49fc-8378-7abfbba33b14', '8077c49c-0a00-478b-9c87-9a417cb3131f', '81984aeb-cedf-4630-a8ae-803c0353fccd', '98eb869b-f90c-42a5-b467-20f887e0e2f2', '99223e71-c381-4aa8-9b9e-c54bb1c8c803', '992918ce-151f-4879-aa4f-0a7c82b4e918', 'a219839f-6816-4bf4-9fe1-84e87f3dc72d', 'a38b97d5-7191-4cb5-9824-b3a90652bc9f', 'b01d19dc-a86c-4657-a9ec-d36d7522081f', 'b8251d1b-9af5-45c2-a7f3-78f46c205897', 'd2bb645a-a5f0-4b84-9787-49317e3b4ce7', 'd7355b78-94c3-4e34-aa69-fcb111188d63', 'db1ff796-1e94-496b-a107-0a1c9da0bde8', 'dff68b35-11b2-4ac5-909f-7b444f1506ab', 'e527d717-9b9b-4ac8-8348-f38688aa95eb', 'e8454c06-d401-4d4c-a37a-e86bd5a4b701', 'e85d7d40-460b-4adc-b56b-4867124b86d6', 'ea1198e9-dc94-4ea5-91b4-b79f50fbcc07', 'f662b77d-fe3f-4c00-834b-e1b723ca4568']",Discrete geodesic graph (DGG) for computing geodesic distances on polyhedral surfaces,Computer Aided Geometric Design,2017

1122,"Social collaborative filtering recommender systems extend the traditional user-to-item interaction with explicit user-to-user relationships, thereby allowing for a wider exploration of correlations among users and items, that potentially lead to better recommendations. A number of methods have been proposed in the direction of exploring the social network, either locally (i.e. the vicinity of each user) or globally. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for collaborative filtering social recommendation that tries to combine the merits of both the aforementioned approaches, based on the soft-clustering of the Friend-of-a-Friend (FoaF) network of each user. This task is accomplished by the non-negative factorization of the adjacency matrix of the FoaF graph, while the edge-centric logic of the factorization algorithm is ameliorated by incorporating more general structural properties of the graph, such as the number of edges and stars, through the introduction of the exponential random graph models.

In this paper, we propose a novel learning automata-based algorithm for this problem which can speed up the process of finding the shortest path using parallelism. For this parallelism, several traverses are initiated, in parallel, from the source node towards the destination node in the graph. During each traverse, required times for traversing from the source node up to any visited node are estimated. The time estimation at each visited node is then given to the learning automaton residing in that node. Using different time estimations provided by different traverses, this learning automaton gradually learns which neighbor of the node is on the shortest path.

1124,"Reactome aims to provide bioinformatics tools for visualisation, interpretation and analysis of pathway knowledge to support basic research, genome analysis, modelling, systems biology and education. Pathway analysis methods have a broad range of applications in physiological and biomedical research; one of the main problems, from the analysis methods performance point of view, is the constantly increasing size of the data samples. Here, we present a new high-performance in-memory implementation of the well-established over-representation analysis method. To achieve the target, the over-representation analysis method is divided in four different steps and, for each of them, specific data structures are used to improve performance and minimise the memory footprint. The first step, finding out whether an identifier in the user’s sample corresponds to an entity in Reactome, is addressed using a radix tree as a lookup table. The second step, modelling the proteins, chemicals, their orthologous in other species and their composition in complexes and sets, is addressed with a graph. The third and fourth steps, that aggregate the results and calculate the statistics, are solved with a double-linked tree. Through the use of highly optimised, in-memory data structures and algorithms, Reactome has achieved a stable, high performance pathway analysis service, enabling the analysis of genome-wide datasets within seconds, allowing interactive exploration and analysis of high throughput data. The proposed pathway analysis approach is available in the Reactome production web site either via the AnalysisService for programmatic access or the user submission interface integrated into the PathwayBrowser. Reactome is an open data and open source project and all of its source code, including the one described here, is available in the AnalysisTools repository in the Reactome GitHub (#N#                    https://github.com/reactome/#N#                    #N#                  ).","['Antonio Fabregat', 'Konstantinos Sidiropoulos', 'Guilherme Viteri', 'Oscar Forner', 'Pablo Marin-Garcia', 'Vicente Arnau', 'Peter D’Eustachio', 'Lincoln Stein', 'Henning Hermjakob']",5b416e26-e6e9-4d71-aab2-b1458c20da89,0,"['17f3b24c-b4d9-4d54-b9fa-57490e0bd6ba', '20520bf2-db3f-4623-8395-a9b8ed16adcf', '2599dc16-bd83-40ca-a6f4-48dde9a4ffb2', '53ba7ebb-a5eb-4b4d-9434-4af040523b21', '67f78e30-153e-4e48-a2d7-85dfaf7a43d2', '8340cc97-b4c5-4c30-8140-37e4ac555081', '8fb5a525-89f5-437e-ae99-2c090dab5684', 'c7f9bfa8-3e86-4404-970f-a84f2575dd8a', 'dbae7bb7-6db4-45e2-b942-a07b03c538ad']",Reactome pathway analysis: a high-performance in-memory approach,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
1125,"A substantial effort is underway to make robots useful outside controlled environments and without direct human supervision. In practice, this can happen only after a rigorous certification process which ensures that several requirements, e.g., operation safety, are met. Automated verification of control programs can be part of cost-effective methodologies to support certification, but it is widely recognized as difficult to attain in robotics, because of several traits that characterize robot design and implementation. One such trait is the widespread usage of middleware to implement control programs in a distributed fashion. In these cases, the challenge of verification is made steep mainly by the fact that the correctness of control software depends on middleware components whose structured models might not be available, or too difficult to obtain from their documentation.#R##N##R##N#Our proposal is to ease the application of automated verification techniques by identifying abstract middleware models in the form of finite-state automata. The identification procedure is itself largely automated, and the only prerequisite is for the middleware to be available for controlled experimentation. Once middleware models are computed, behaviors that would lead to unsafe operation can be spotted automatically on a composition of identified middleware and control software models using model checking techniques. The approach is based on our tool AIDE – Automata IDentification Engine – to identify abstract middleware models, and the model checker SPIN to verify control units. To validate our approach, we consider four different case studies built on YARP publish–subscribe middleware. Our results confirm that AIDE enables the extension of precise engineering methods to distributed control software in robotics.","['Ali Khalili', 'Massimo Narizzano', 'Lorenzo Natale', 'Armando Tacchella']",9e5a8d36-e584-43de-a429-49cfbccfe791,0,"['05f232a3-4bb1-4046-8f26-6bfd58b71668', '0b27a792-995a-436c-80e5-9e7a996059f6', '0ed68089-824a-4da6-a84d-0d51c04426ed', '252b9e3e-4e30-426b-b4fc-2859b4e5503c', '28ca0e84-8ff9-44c8-8b4f-33a8fc196739', '32518a4c-fbc3-470f-8024-cb7a65f1fe3f', '41cf9713-ed76-43a6-8e9f-538abc2f787c', '46c7118b-3ef4-4adb-a37a-e4363417f176', '4814eca2-167a-48bd-a7e6-60150e7a54e3', '4a4df749-e5ce-4e81-be80-fc1cd04c5c4b', '5b8c69a9-eff8-4442-85ab-13f4ec79d9d1', '714bfb60-ccc8-4d41-b79b-0b5c7fe559d5', '77d62820-c794-4375-b531-1e3b9a2878bd', '8c2d184e-e3e0-46cf-91e2-52174457a813', '8dcaf686-a6b2-4b13-b984-e46fa43d2942', 'b9f21d70-ef7a-41cb-9201-891a133ee8f9', 'babf7525-d50a-4bf3-9143-2134f1ad4f46', 'c411b8bc-b44d-4bef-a498-6b2d9a722f29', 'd64db46c-ef43-47f2-bb92-5e3a6b36d7a8', 'db04d2da-3165-458a-8941-39d80355b9ee', 'e1470f3d-df1b-4ac1-87ac-1e45b9064a2f', 'e57559ef-8159-4925-ae0c-a48b28ac4e77']",Learning middleware models for verification of distributed control programs,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2017

1127,"An attention region usually possesses a closed contour and a significant color contrast against its surroundings. Inspired by this observation, a novel prior so called closure prior is introduced as an important high-level saliency cue in this paper. Specifically, firstly, the connectivity analysis is used in layered bit planes to extract closed regions based on closure prior. Secondly, the closed regions touching image boundaries are removed based on the assumption that most photographers will not crop attention regions along the view frame. Thirdly, based on the hypothesis that an image region should have a big contrast against its surroundings if it has more chances in all bit planes to be a closed region, the contrast contributions of a closed region in all bit planes are accumulated to obtain color contrast. Meanwhile, by taking account for the characteristics of human visual system according to the perception of small attention region, and the mechanism of human visual resource allocation between attention regions, several morphological filtering technologies are applied to the steps of color contrast calculating. Finally, the saliency map aiming for attention region detection is generated from the contrast map. The experimental results show the presented detection method achieves acceptable performance compared with twelve state-of-the-art models.","['Jiazhong Chen', 'Bingpeng Ma', 'Hua Cao', 'Jie Chen', 'Yebin Fan', 'Tao Xia', 'Rong Li']",010f94f1-7a9e-40a3-9b34-27404adcc3ad,0,"['32f70af0-52a7-4e7a-9bde-ea0bf49dcaf5', '3dbaa7b6-c17e-4a70-9bce-1eaafed0a74c', '4d91cc59-6a13-46fa-992b-116cd362cb42', '56cca75d-c1f2-4535-901a-81e218666fcc', '5ae8bac5-6cbc-4691-a3c0-4ecdd37c3575', '682cc713-62d0-4d92-a262-302b25354b26', '6d121e97-e351-4cf9-8c44-d7ab3ce9d9fe', '7293dc9d-03ec-42c3-9574-cefaf30121d1', '84c3e045-eb7f-4d48-8131-19e74a7d6308', '86b626a6-f948-45ea-8e92-8102e0dc5ef8', '8db12848-56b4-4381-a49f-77c6c07c521f', '8f18a9ef-859c-4575-8b47-9ae9f9472700', '910a1aa9-086a-4a91-b3b1-6a434fcfb7eb', '92f24f9d-b487-452b-9d0f-ec626d42096a', 'a9dda7f1-b348-4377-b344-e9e84f944cac', 'b0315d22-968c-4aee-b9c7-5560a93ff33f', 'b2d8ae74-5b8d-44dc-9a78-64e2fd7e6c26', 'bc5877af-2565-400b-9a99-4737c705e88a', 'bd0997d2-66b7-4693-9a13-429e8145fac9', 'bd44dc16-f951-49d1-8495-99bd2b741d86', 'f6db2523-eee1-454e-9ae0-6280a127c356', 'f718291e-c799-4c7f-ac83-cb099bf9ab58']",Attention region detection based on closure prior in layered bit Planes,Neurocomputing,2017

1129,"Recommender systems suggest items by exploiting the interactions of the users with the system (e.g., the choice of the movies to recommend to a user is based on those she previously evaluated). In particular,  content-based  systems suggest items whose content is similar to that of the items evaluated by a user. An emerging application domain in content-based recommender systems is represented by the consideration of the semantics behind an item description, in order to have a disambiguation of the words in the description and improve the recommendation accuracy. However, different phenomena, such as changes in the preferences of a user over time or the use of her account by third parties, might affect the accuracy by considering items that do not reflect the actual user preferences.

1130,"Nowadays, mobile devices are often equipped with high-end processing units and large storage space. Mobile users usually store personal, official, and large amount of multimedia data. Security of such devices are mainly dependent on PIN (personal identification number), password, bio-metric data, or gestures/patterns. However, these mechanisms have a lot of security vulnerabilities and prone to various types of attacks such as shoulder surfing. The uniqueness of Electroencephalography (EEG) signal can be exploited to remove some of the drawbacks of the existing systems. Such signals can be recorded and transmitted through wireless medium for processing. In this paper, we propose a new framework to secure mobile devices using EEG signals along with existing pattern-based authentication. The pattern based authentication passwords are considered as identification tokens. We have investigated the use of EEG signals recorded during pattern drawing over the screen of the mobile device in the authentication phase. To accomplish this, we have collected EEG signals of 50 users while drawing different patterns. The robustness of the system has been evaluated against 2400 unauthorized attempts made by 30 unauthorized users who have tried to gain access of the device using known patterns of 20 genuine users. EEG signals are modeled using Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and using a binary classifier implemented with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to verify the authenticity of a test pattern. Verification performances are measured using three popular security matrices, namely Detection Error Trade-off (DET), Half Total Error Rate (HTER), and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Our experiments revel that, the method is promising and can be a possible alternative to develop robust authentication protocols for hand-held devices.","['Pradeep Kumar', 'R.P.

We also present experimental results on the flow rule installation/read throughput and the failover time upon a controller failure in ONOS and ODL, and identify open research challenges.","['Dongeun Suh', 'Seokwon Jang', 'Sol Han', 'Sangheon Pack', 'Myung-Sup Kim', 'Taehong Kim', 'Chang-Gyu Lim']",42d554ab-8b01-44ad-b675-7c860685a224,0,"['0332c8df-0675-4da6-a161-0060cf224c29', '15558d2b-d3e0-44b5-adbf-1a7fd837e933', '28f22fc4-0e3e-4530-b1e5-cb37e95bfd40', '3d45c181-6a36-4b9b-a7b7-69e513a2ee7f', '4cce2aa8-7689-418b-8d67-61ddc87b6f86', '5477474b-c802-4696-b2e5-57a8f6bd14ae', '94f07791-d2e5-46f6-9f97-483814068150', 'abf7f290-5b74-4b9a-9661-a1af46b0083a', 'cb8a0088-f03e-4142-82a9-769b329e251e']",Toward Highly Available and Scalable Software Defined Networks for Service Providers,IEEE Communications Magazine,2017

For their female counterparts, distrust reduces both perceived ease of use and adoption intention for an online service provider. Additionally, for male consumers, only opinionated review aids in alleviating distrust. Conversely, both numerical rating and opinionated review aid in alleviating the distrust of female consumers. Moreover, in contrast to their female counterparts, male consumers are less susceptible to the influence of cognitive dissonance between numerical rating and opinionated review.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Research limitations/implications#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#This study integrates distrust with the technology acceptance model (TAM) in an attempt to gain a deeper appreciation of technology acceptance behavior. Furthermore, this study builds on the confirmation bias theory to delineate e-WOM into numerical rating and opinionated review in order to better explicate variations in how males and females react to these two distinct forms of e-WOM. Consistent with the cognitive dissonance theory, the distinction between numerical rating and opinionated review enables further exploration of the impact of cognitive dissonance between these two forms of e-WOM on male and female consumers’ distrust of online service providers.

1134,"A central problem in risk management is that of identifying the optimal combination (or portfolio) of improvements that enhance the reliability of the system most through reducing failure event probabilities, subject to the availability of resources. This optimal portfolio can be sensitive with regard to epistemic uncertainties about the failure events' probabilities. In this paper, we develop an optimization model to support the allocation of resources to improvements that mitigate risks in coherent systems in which interval-valued probabilities defined by lower and upper bounds are employed to capture epistemic uncertainties. Decision recommendations are based on portfolio dominance: a resource allocation portfolio is dominated if there exists another portfolio that improves system reliability (i) at least as much for all feasible failure probabilities and (ii) strictly more for some feasible probabilities. Based on non-dominated portfolios, recommendations about improvements to implement are derived by inspecting in how many non-dominated portfolios a given improvement is contained. We present an exact method for computing the non-dominated portfolios. We also present an approximate method that simplifies the reliability function using total order interactions so that larger problem instances can be solved with reasonable computational effort.","['Antti Toppila', 'Ahti Salo']",d52eab56-dc2f-4fef-a4a3-9d7a88a6ad3c,50,"['2bc807cb-eb79-4905-9f6b-44af5200aad7', '473bfb10-86d3-409f-990c-b89792b9de06', '4f6ffc22-597d-4a54-94c4-28478bd39d91', '6a4bbd10-f21f-4f19-a72e-c4986daa0cca', '6c3fb0c8-a334-4020-bc45-faa5ab4e68b4', '71a0c7b2-01b1-48d1-9f7b-681de51a88d4', '874d8a40-0121-4496-947f-6f4cf95a5728', 'a03e9369-012d-4b1a-89e3-e72fe0e7425b', 'b0ef4683-5bb8-413c-af3a-03fb6da998c5', 'bb8010cc-86e7-46fd-a652-2bacf928c3c0', 'c071b6a9-7147-464b-b126-bbbe84f233f0', 'd20c342b-5829-4085-9e30-158921c9414b', 'd653cd16-aca5-4fc8-9839-437957515bf0', 'd6959ae8-40a4-404f-998a-e77878baf0b4', 'da4f41ce-662e-4a71-936a-3593c70c71c3', 'f0f64235-08c1-4999-a0a8-bc0b69e0f121']",Selection of risk reduction portfolios under interval-valued probabilities,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,2017
1135,"RRAM is an emerging technology with vast applications in computation and storage. RRAM with MLC capabilities is more interesting owing to its higher storage density. In this study, we proposed an approach for RRAM-based MLC design. The approach starts with capacitor-based quantization of electric charge applying to RRAM. Numerical characterizations of a unit-circuit, including RRAM, capacitor and one MOS transistor were used. Two Stanford and Peking-Stanford RRAM models were employed in this study. The proposed design results in simplified circuitry and avoids power hungry elements (e.g. Op-Amp). A detailed RRAM-based MLC memory array is implemented. To simplify the memory read process, a TIQ-ADC is employed. To evaluate the approach, circuit-level mixed SPICE/Verilog-A simulations were performed. The variation and random effects are experimented using Monte-Carlo simulations. The costs of the proposed approach are design-time pre-computation and complexity of one-time device characterization.","['A.A. Bagheri-Soulla', 'M. B.

1136,"Document clustering is generally the first step for topic identification. Since many clustering methods operate on the similarities between documents, it is important to build representations of these documents which keep their semantics as much as possible and are also suitable for efficient similarity calculation. As we describe in Koopman et al. (Proceedings of ISSI 2015 Istanbul: 15th International Society of Scientometrics and Informetrics Conference, Istanbul, Turkey, 29 June to 3 July, 2015. Bogazici University Printhouse. http://www.issi2015.org/files/downloads/all-papers/1042.pdf, 2015), the metadata of articles in the Astro dataset contribute to a semantic matrix, which uses a vector space to capture the semantics of entities derived from these articles and consequently supports the contextual exploration of these entities in LittleAriadne. However, this semantic matrix does not allow to calculate similarities between articles directly. In this paper, we will describe in detail how we build a semantic representation for an article from the entities that are associated with it. Base on such semantic representations of articles, we apply two standard clustering methods, K-Means and the Louvain community detection algorithm, which leads to our two clustering solutions labelled as OCLC-31 (standing for K-Means) and OCLC-Louvain (standing for Louvain). In this paper, we will give the implementation details and a basic comparison with other clustering solutions that are reported in this special issue.","['Shenghui Wang', 'Rob Koopman']",e8cbffc8-d292-4d4b-ae22-f96c645e4461,50,"['1055eed2-9aa5-4ef0-bcbd-1a2e02e2e031', '114e0ba9-7bcc-434d-b96d-8cec1b77c0af', '3662e5bc-d634-43c2-90fe-f18ebd3033f4', '3ef1aa0d-ec81-4ed7-9c5a-d47cc156dce9', '50d9a0e1-00a5-4445-b8b2-9f1405cbe6e1', '56182f0c-b75a-48ef-b804-0a4f261e6e63', '56e776cd-5e6a-4e97-b970-4b074f4750d3', '5d73c5dc-a5eb-4d73-81b5-6c85856a40a7', '5e7b1c2c-baaf-466d-be01-c075002bf1fb', '8fed7067-5f57-4f15-88cc-c948bcdd83f4', '9bf550a9-49d3-4b44-ac11-b3edc269b3f2', '9db03307-0295-48a3-83ee-e7dfdc947d00', 'aed93643-9d6d-4dc5-a99c-742617e367ff', 'b2c2e15a-df38-423a-a8bb-ed8dd0170e7e', 'c4d07a11-08b5-4f47-b73b-6f13cadcdf0c', 'd9194ae3-7fa8-4c1c-a681-d1bac8050fa7', 'e065b245-8f3a-4746-85a7-a0dc51c5aebf']",Clustering articles based on semantic similarity,Scientometrics,2017
1137,"In multifocus image fusion, accurate detection of the focused pixel from source images is crucial to improve the quality of fused result. Traditionally, the method developed in spatial domain is commonly used. However, such approaches tend to produce boundary seams or distortions. To this end, we propose a new fixed window technique of multiscale image analysis (MIA) and a new weighted fusion strategy by employing non-local means filtering (NLF). This new scheme consists of three parts: detection of focused pixel, correction of detecting results, and generation of fusion weight maps for source images. To improve detection robustness against the size of object, we develop the fixed window technique of MIA to detect the focused pixels, and then we construct the initial fusion decision map for each of source images by combining those detection results; second, we present a new refining process based on block consistency evaluation for correcting the initial detection result. At last, the corresponding source images are used as a guide and combined with the NLF to produce the fusion weight maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our approach is superior to that of many state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both visual perception and objective evaluation.","['Huafeng Li', 'Hongmei Qiu', 'Zhengtao Yu', 'Bo Li']",b780f67e-cfa0-401e-8d56-48d14977226b,0,"['04f38cf3-16eb-405b-8fd0-3c7b5ca4ee6b', '0c32535a-72bb-4fda-b12b-627147f8b358', '0d573fb2-d305-403f-ae59-8e85820bcf0b', '1ae5977d-8984-4b04-9477-fc00e1d55839', '20eb0941-5e69-48dc-9461-ee7fd5415321', '22c09b2c-4645-482e-8604-2a5a8df9eb88', '3c534a8f-5e0d-4337-aedb-0858e6569be3', '3c83bac4-7d15-4a30-9be7-26f6fe12bf9f', '4289bfe3-7305-41e5-a19d-8f0dd37e9892', '44e2e5b3-857a-46d4-9ca1-bccbec1d0cf2', '4674a5c9-f4b0-486d-a76d-cc16c851fcbd', '4841e822-2d07-418c-bbac-f16635602a31', '4b2fa4b6-4683-482d-a1ac-fb9a254c7072', '5764293e-0015-4a96-a041-ace4a1e5dbce', '57dac555-b3dd-4713-9062-13b966f3b5b9', '5abb8f67-6540-4dee-a449-e6df68987e06', '612f4d2a-f9b0-48b6-984f-43056063571e', '72866173-7f6d-47fb-8a3d-08867568ca3c', '777515fc-014f-4bd2-abd9-a3963c99a7e8', '7a663df7-98db-4e54-bdac-94c03c9558fa', '7e279ff4-6409-4809-b29a-61e7663fd794', '933df1dd-ccb2-4dd8-b62d-e16e669d07d9', '966e8ea7-ad11-4071-9657-4a5674415900', '9b178ea8-38bb-4e71-954c-6c420c3d966e', 'a08fffb8-9430-414c-be7b-1c0f766f5f7c', 'a40236f4-b9e3-4c66-8e25-e37b17d68b08', 'a5112411-28d7-41e8-9f5e-98b240abdbb1', 'a6e83843-8ac5-45ed-83c1-4c4426bb11a2', 'aff098d4-61a4-4c3c-bde8-c830b2ee5081', 'b3f680e3-ab94-4c40-b38e-b5f5044b6a4d', 'c0bd79e7-4077-4576-bb1e-8fd0c4a82c89', 'c3e07ea7-0649-421b-9e34-751443dc5c83', 'd7dd9480-dee2-40db-a6cc-11389440b031', 'dd997031-7734-4e15-9f03-67e44a0d3584', 'e4b55f4a-4071-402b-a14d-f6be9bb1aefb', 'e6b9f7f4-4c7d-43cb-942f-5c501542cc76', 'e85b915f-d59f-469e-9f0c-264111104109', 'ec1b10b7-14c0-4fe5-a2f7-c71e33981b19', 'f2e0f00c-c97f-4ec0-8733-a5f098588b3c', 'f441af57-2e84-4fd8-965f-9603968e8ac7', 'f4cd2619-277a-4824-82d1-117eef72ce8e', 'fc383795-9968-4e25-9214-09d4860097a4']",Multifocus image fusion via fixed window technique of multiscale images and non-local means filtering,Signal Processing,2017
1138,"This paper concerns the generation of distributed vector representations of biomedical concepts from structured knowledge, in the form of subject-relation-object triplets known as semantic predications. Specifically, we evaluate the extent to which a representational approach we have developed for this purpose previously, known as Predication-based Semantic Indexing (PSI), might benefit from insights gleaned from neural-probabilistic language models, which have enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years as a means to generate distributed vector representations of terms from free text. To do so, we develop a novel neural-probabilistic approach to encoding predications, called Embedding of Semantic Predications (ESP), by adapting aspects of the Skipgram with Negative Sampling (SGNS) algorithm to this purpose. We compare ESP and PSI across a number of tasks including recovery of encoded information, estimation of semantic similarity and relatedness, and identification of potentially therapeutic and harmful relationships using both analogical retrieval and supervised learning. We find advantages for ESP in some, but not all of these tasks, revealing the contexts in which the additional computational work of neural-probabilistic modeling is justified.","['Trevor Cohen', 'Dominic Widdows']",7fa083fb-7057-49f1-a711-5b294110271c,0,"['08b6dddf-32d4-4364-9abd-0930eb85cc1f', '0c688960-2bf3-4232-9c29-04914d5fa5b0', '0e836174-48cd-4570-b454-bc0de21a4dce', '12f40b38-cd99-4801-8074-d765a29a2101', '177833ca-9c57-49bc-87db-4f30e181f2dc', '18eee157-6f61-45e6-9edf-284ccd157659', '1fb3dbee-0cb6-46df-9d46-0136181335d8', '21488b4a-240e-4a9d-9c26-8835ec5ede30', '226438a1-e1a1-4995-b517-7ff251d3dd4b', '23e64297-aac8-4d1e-a8b7-595eeec788d3', '2c8cc23f-7533-4399-9a24-e58615f3ec9f', '2c94cbfa-597e-4db6-ad89-00f74f417104', '2eba2e65-bae1-4343-afa1-9d9954a05f71', '3715c870-6569-4d20-8797-af8569e5fde5', '38db4131-b3f5-46a2-b912-5812691cac78', '393d1887-e68a-4fa8-b01e-8e41fce2f866', '3cfde0b8-bf86-47b3-9691-e45d92b6b518', '3d66a2c4-e0ad-47b6-a8e1-5fdbfba5e761', '3f426685-cf88-4eed-98ac-3e4ea70a4ca9', '403648a3-7b71-466c-a815-7015bac1e4e6', '470c486c-f7ce-479e-98e0-78517c7fc628', '48f05619-2172-4006-9b6d-59377b882e8a', '558106fe-42ee-4b70-b844-5398a25aab67', '56779127-d643-4785-88b4-a1737f2295e8', '5bea2f4f-8bc3-418b-9ec0-5b9b6aab6499', '5c3ac428-62bc-4119-80d0-0270eb334485', '60e7eb53-bd18-4744-8f01-589ddde72835', '6a3e914e-b665-4269-9676-089832fd4e59', '6b7b0a20-dd62-407f-9975-ba06f5e6d079', '758ce08c-0932-4b3c-b7c3-2e8d171a088b', '7814ab26-4ca0-4bc3-b41a-28fdb5d99179', '7aa454b2-47c6-4117-b823-1df65289e8e7', '822fe934-f7b9-4d74-b622-66f57f37ea3e', '994bb401-be5d-48be-af25-58fbdfd42ec6', '9c7a03fe-f205-4afe-b97a-fdeaffa846cd', 'bc1cf646-43d9-4fb8-a1ce-c8f5ea5c18b9', 'c186e8f6-42e1-4bb8-8fe3-039e0cd02532', 'ccc91c53-bb9c-4b35-a09c-4407e34dfd35', 'cdf60c4f-1a1c-4587-b241-cae92580e667', 'cebf5237-4ba3-4974-b1fe-62a6ce43fc66', 'db86f1b8-4aa8-445a-8287-499623ba3245', 'e407acd7-dfcf-4ee8-9140-6726c01abf4e', 'e8ec34dd-01d8-4221-8234-3bcb07eca99d', 'ed87f81f-79e8-40b2-b023-3d8581cba230', 'f1079a79-af8d-4704-bf35-bf6a4347ea22', 'f13b1d03-4e44-46e3-a102-df6ef8e0227f', 'f4ae42ba-ad10-4fdf-9a52-2171baf40832']",Embedding of semantic predications,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,2017
1139,"Eye detection and eye state (close/open) estimation are important for a wide range of applications, including iris recognition, visual interaction and driver fatigue detection. Current work typically performs eye detection first, followed by eye state estimation by a separate classifier. Such an approach fails to capture the interactions between eye location and its state. In this paper, we propose a method for simultaneous eye detection and eye state estimation. Based on a cascade regression framework, our method iteratively estimates the location of the eye and the probability of the eye being occluded by eyelid. At each iteration of cascaded regression, image features from the eye center as well as contextual image features from eyelid and eye corners are jointly used to estimate the eye position and openness probability. Using the eye openness probability, the most likely eye state can be estimated. Since it requires large number of facial images with labeled eye related landmarks, we propose to combine the real and synthetic images for training. It further improves the performance by utilizing this learning-by-synthesis method. Evaluations of our method on benchmark databases such as BioID and Gi4E database as well as on real world driving videos demonstrate its superior performance comparing to state-of-the-art methods for both eye detection and eye state estimation.","['Chao Gou', 'Yue Wu', 'Kang Wang', 'Kunfeng Wang', 'Fei-Yue Wang', 'Qiang Ji']",41fa933f-a845-4c52-bc54-113ad4b31d6c,0,"['02ecf572-dcd9-4102-b1cf-16761890964a', '1078e076-20c8-4650-8627-2c22c7ea633b', '16402c63-cabf-4dfd-b9cc-f623eee71cf3', '18febc1d-2205-426a-89c8-82fafb9d89f4', '268f6ffe-ba71-470b-b68b-6a7ccd3963f6', '2d851604-9db9-4104-8674-a2e84fb92f5a', '357ea817-f6ef-45db-b43e-4aaa4e5ba222', '59ca2c9e-ddaa-49dc-a55a-35b1c94d083b', '5d991019-e75b-443f-9565-e828c4c685c6', '5fcb5d63-33e3-48de-a025-1c2c6ca2f5b0', '64fa74e8-db02-4190-87d7-bf23e9859a7c', '789fb366-56a8-4779-a899-fe476d8d6a3c', '7cc8408a-9e46-4b88-887c-94d47f164884', '7cfad0f5-b4f3-402f-a5a9-cf9283f3c30d', '81eec382-cc0a-4381-91df-a90054925734', '8b8a2247-bd77-4736-b493-449734f56b9a', '94ee663d-19e7-4d16-9c8d-4b811d1d383c', '9a286d58-981b-4d2b-80ae-144d79a02056', 'a5626c84-b850-4098-8b3f-e20b3dfe1c33', 'affd330e-54e4-4add-ae07-461cb12c8e53', 'b721775e-eb58-4c5d-bb6e-8b7af6200de6', 'bcb14eab-b14c-4d88-993b-1966039f1cc4', 'cde434b8-b922-4373-a08a-5fa0ee6b69eb', 'd00ce47a-7ca3-4f2b-b4da-542c8d7c34c3', 'dd5884b3-298f-4b34-83f2-bed3c90f6252', 'e34b36b0-3bd1-4ced-8e17-d21c56ffc466', 'e3cbbac4-2e13-4435-92d4-0ed77addd529', 'e9c69789-5f06-4cb4-87d7-d1ed2b00b803', 'ebd8f13c-15e7-4cb7-98eb-18813d000355', 'ee5f5477-295f-4cb7-99b9-2e612aa86f5f', 'eec89bef-0148-4fe9-a30c-e5ec4a896332', 'f6ac5751-eb2f-4c75-a40d-86168811fa5a']",A joint cascaded framework for simultaneous eye detection and eye state estimation,Pattern Recognition,2017
1140,"Objective. The possible effect of blood pressure measurements per se on heart rate variability (HRV) was studied in the setting of concomitant ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and Holter ECG monitoring (HM). Methods. In 25 hypertensive patients (14 women and 11 men, mean age: 58.1 years), 24-hour combined ABPM and HM were performed. For every blood pressure measurement, 2-minute ECG segments (before, during, and after measurement) were analyzed to obtain time domain parameters of HRV: SDNN and rMSSD. Mean of normal RR intervals (MNN), SDNN/MNN, and rMSSD/MNN were calculated, too. Parameter variations related to blood pressure measurements were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons. Results. 2281 measurements (1518 during the day and 763 during the night) were included in the analysis. Both SDNN and SDNN/MNN had a constant (the same for 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime values) and significant change related to blood pressure measurements: an increase during measurements and a decrease after them ( for any variation). Conclusion. In the setting of combined ABPM and HM, the blood pressure measurement itself produces an increase in short-term heart rate variability. Clarifying the physiological basis and the possible clinical value of this phenomenon needs further studies.","['Attila Frigy', 'Annamária Magdás', 'Victor-Dan Moga', 'Ioana Georgiana Coteț', 'Miklós Kozlovszky', 'László Szilágyi']",b457faa4-7246-4c5d-9e4e-5416cf202476,0,[],Increase of Short-Term Heart Rate Variability Induced by Blood Pressure Measurements during Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2017
1141,"With the development of Next Generation Sequencing technologies, the number of predicted proteins from entire (meta-) genomes has risen exponentially. While for some of these sequences protein functions can be inferred from homology, an experimental characterization is still a requirement for the determination of protein function. However, functional characterization of proteins cannot keep pace with our capabilities to generate more and more sequence data. Here, we present an approach to reduce the number of proteins from entire (meta-) genomes to a reasonably small number for further experimental characterization without loss of important information. About 6.1 million predicted proteins from the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition Metagenome project were distributed into classes based either on homology to existing hidden markov models (HMMs) of known families, or de novo by assessment of pairwise similarity. 5.1 million of these proteins could be classified in this way, yielding 18,437 families. For 4,129 protein families, which did not match existing HMMs from databases, we could create novel HMMs. For each family, we then selected a representative protein, which showed the closest homology to all other proteins in this family. We then selected representatives of four families based on their homology to known and well-characterized lipases. From these four synthesized genes, we could obtain the novel esterase/lipase GOS54, validating our approach. Using an in silico approach, we were able improve the success rate of functional screening and make entire (meta-) genomes amenable for biochemical characterization.","['Anna Kusnezowa', 'Lars I.

Endowing this vantage point with contemporary advances in sparsity-aware modeling and processing promotes the nonparametric basis pursuit advocated in this article as the overarching framework for the confluence of kernel-based learning (KBL) approaches leveraging sparse linear regression, nuclear-norm regularization, and dictionary learning. The novel sparse KBL toolbox goes beyond translating sparse parametric approaches to their nonparametric counterparts to incorporate new possibilities such as multikernel selection and matrix smoothing. The impact of sparse KBL to signal processing applications is illustrated through test cases from cognitive radio sensing, microarray data imputation, and network traffic prediction.","['Juan Andres Bazerque', 'Georgios B.

1144,"Advance in high-throughput technologies in genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics has created demand for bioinformatics tools to integrate high-dimensional data from different sources. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a statistical tool for finding linear associations between different types of information. Previous extensions of CCA used to capture nonlinear associations, such as kernel CCA, did not allow feature selection or capturing of multiple canonical components. Here we propose a novel method, two-stage kernel CCA (TSKCCA) to select appropriate kernels in the framework of multiple kernel learning. TSKCCA first selects relevant kernels based on the HSIC criterion in the multiple kernel learning framework. Weights are then derived by non-negative matrix decomposition with L1 regularization. Using artificial datasets and nutrigenomic datasets, we show that TSKCCA can extract multiple, nonlinear associations among high-dimensional data and multiplicative interactions among variables. TSKCCA can identify nonlinear associations among high-dimensional data more reliably than previous nonlinear CCA methods.","['Kosuke Yoshida', 'Junichiro Yoshimoto', 'Kenji Doya']",881d6909-3d43-40e0-8811-89c7725145a3,0,"['08eb37c5-f3fb-4b6a-b63e-1172dbc8ade8', '20f60a14-ab57-4408-8fd4-c6c29f441dd3', '243c246b-6612-4e22-8f67-fd438381dc9b', '2a15f947-2402-4979-94b8-53de9ceef26e', '2b9ece14-9365-400a-98d6-b5639d032277', '50474618-2e92-4684-9c70-48e277abb029', '670ea5fc-2f1c-4ff6-b757-de4f310c5415', '6ee2e88c-0259-4424-91d3-911ee52e2434', '846d232e-f9d4-44dc-b82e-ef5c3602fa21', '9c2ed18d-2a96-48f2-ab3c-49b67a88f218', 'a5e3c7d4-bdc9-46e9-9ebd-044328488842', 'bc41219a-ae7f-42da-84ef-9c862c991cf9', 'e042f130-af8f-4345-a3a1-20bcd58e2821', 'e4a30447-8981-4bfd-89f4-c282f0e5951a']",Sparse kernel canonical correlation analysis for discovery of nonlinear interactions in high-dimensional data,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
1145,"Due to the recent emergence of a new generation of distribution center (DC) automation systems, there is a growing interest in DC automation in the retail industry. The investment decision related to this new class of DCs is financially and operationally significant. In this paper, we present a framework for sizing a full-case automated DC – a key step in the investment evaluation. We investigate the sizing issue at three levels: strategic, technology, and operations level. The approach informs systematic decision-making for sizing automated DCs. Moreover, we find little published research in context of sizing full-case technology DCs. We evaluate strategic, design, and operational issues for three key modules: regular case handling system (RCHS), non-regular case handling system (IRCHS), and less-than case handling system (LCHS). We employ discrete event simulation as a tool for an aggregate-level modeling and analysis. We develop an approach to sizing each module, develop characteristic curves for critical equipment for each module, and also size the key buffers. These tools and results could be used by retailers to make sizing estimates for equipment, trade-off between equipment, and for DC layout design.","['Vimal K. Dubey', 'D.

The optimization models that have been developed to tackle this problem often perform unsatisfactorily, providing solutions for which the fleet availability exhibits significant variability. In order to handle this difficulty, in this work we develop a mixed integer programming model, which, besides the typical objective maximizing the fleet availability, also includes an additional objective that minimizes its variability. Motivated by the substantial computational difficulties the typical e-constraint reduced feasible region approach is faced with, as a result of the solution complexity of the optimization models involved, we also develop two specialized solution methodologies for this problem. Both methodologies identify the entire frontier of non-dominated solutions, utilizing suitable relaxations of the original model and exploiting the fact that the domain comprising possible fleet availability values is a discrete set. The first one disaggregates the original FMP model into smaller subproblems whose solution is attained much more efficiently. The second one is a variant of the e-constraint method, applied to a suitable relaxation of the original FMP model. We present extensive computational results assessing the efficiency of the proposed solution methodologies and demonstrating that their performance is significantly superior to that of the typical e-constraint method applied directly to the original biobjective model.","['Andreas Gavranis', 'George Kozanidis']",c4c7375b-a601-45f2-81fa-3b995fefc5df,0,"['20640298-3bb6-4526-b56c-4f4143390a5b', '2066969e-1b95-4fee-8853-71adc43c4b75', '3fee0505-73b7-4592-bfb6-59fd42e7f2e2', '538ab023-3bc6-4a64-896d-38771d11ecc0', '54771f7a-538c-4ad9-8577-6cdcc22632b4', '73091999-0240-42ea-855c-eb923e03bc5e', '93043c55-9ffe-4ac3-be9f-ec2a3e7fa878', 'bf766d4e-5e7d-4018-8540-5add94b9096e', 'c3782d90-4fc2-48ae-8e32-9cf73d61e7d8', 'f6f9fc82-6ae4-4b97-93db-2e392f6633e2']",Mixed integer biobjective quadratic programming for maximum-value minimum-variability fleet availability of a unit of mission aircraft,Computers & Industrial Engineering,2017

We present a Systematic Mapping Study of 86 articles to give an overview on the state of the art in this area of research and present a roadmap with open issues and future directions.","['Quinten David Soetens', 'Romain Robbes', 'Serge Demeyer']",d91bf8df-4a9a-4332-9bec-a678b02b7e23,0,"['0373c548-a4a9-4d86-a205-f594113b9933', '03b81a23-9884-4f0c-9450-8a701d5dcdb8', '0576819d-4bf8-4515-9b80-7204ba69b5e4', '08c0d910-e673-4da8-bec8-ea8f6b8184fd', '098aceb8-0cd3-41fa-8b08-f7728f6d2a2f', '0b9dda3d-bb34-42ce-8bea-5e04f66ce980', '0c5ae945-b431-4311-8fe6-5475ccbf713b', '0fc1060b-87eb-4a00-92c8-9d701f23cb2d', '0fc116cc-c1c5-4a24-8a7c-c183158147ab', '10454eb7-2e68-429f-bd6c-fb50b886dcad', '11df7d57-bad8-4b0b-8ce8-e26c6d9eb2b0', '17a0a3de-5308-4a3d-9501-dd980918f67d', '17a30a43-641a-4878-96c3-5d2c5a21a8f0', '184db203-e41b-4e0c-91fc-af9b6c9e4c82', '1c34e54f-8d52-4a60-83f0-cc3bc9815f1a', '1e9c01e2-fd64-44d6-a656-04342c05307a', '1ef6ec6f-cbbb-4126-9530-422c879095a6', '216368f8-a002-45e2-bcef-f6b7290a47f3', '225fc4c1-bb13-4f5a-8aab-e2d10bca9637', '23f79b90-99e0-4a2c-a484-58b0605cda78', '247700dd-3570-430d-8d4d-2e51837dee7a', '282dc37e-a2df-49bd-84eb-01cc555fa522', '2aac813c-421b-47a4-a260-b90900a38df8', '2abd64bc-cf45-4d3a-ae4f-034242346c09', '2bf15707-e4d9-4390-922a-1021cd034e85', '2cec9d8f-d5ab-4f18-80d2-ec474c4cb21c', '33638814-c070-4a7e-b4fb-633fbdaad53c', '3fd53159-707d-45d2-8b5d-3123cae5cb60', '423afbad-6ab8-4c9a-866f-88e8d3adc74d', '444c6f52-7df2-4ee3-93ca-c1ebb3491d42', '44cf4afa-72c6-4196-ba8c-904ace60ed22', '44f3ca28-5929-4cb0-900f-0713226c383e', '465dc9fa-03ec-4b51-9cdb-9a281c22ac5d', '4726505b-945c-4312-bedb-d79cf392f632', '47ac94fe-2cc9-48e6-9d53-c7cc20d7857d', '4cc8fd1c-37c9-4dcd-a6cc-3bfe13f3acdb', '4fc51346-1bd6-4c60-9b4e-78d2cb037f66', '56547466-7134-409f-bcfd-480232b990a6', '56941878-4354-4039-8b03-b8aa8cbfa6f6', '59c25636-14d7-448c-8d05-9d4ceb33d121', '5a95520f-3b10-4221-ab0e-c3f400ccfa81', '5e255053-3b23-4f8c-a951-2d6ca4dea91f', '60a83ade-c704-43cf-b85b-008040b5e714', '6126124a-927a-4a34-8257-547d984959f2', '616c4fd3-cf16-44ae-9d73-d8e1001f8ed9', '6261dfd0-8d61-42b7-94b8-b867e63d2d6a', '63b37798-953f-46e0-8a9c-d605b79ccbf7', '6aad3287-cb5f-4577-b972-fe906c9ba3ee', '6b884765-eeff-4697-a8c4-6ef5c9a87347', '6db6a568-9013-4954-853e-f5aef0eb4231', '6ee306a5-4b4e-4566-9a3b-186d50eba67b', '6fdde381-d320-4d0e-9740-1c8da51b32e0', '7379df7a-d039-49c0-a32a-30b96d09d559', '788f02a1-f56d-4c7b-b7aa-b04f34299bb2', '7ca4015b-1360-4b55-97d2-a97957853269', '7ed29474-2c76-4439-a9e9-e60ccfbae7da', '8141e257-fa64-4609-b6be-30466021b1c1', '829fe42c-3588-4734-8964-9327be3e2f46', '86387f1b-5232-4347-a04a-6be456a02774', '89752e64-33f1-46db-9eb9-d752525dcb14', '8dc14103-9da9-41b9-830f-96eda413749f', '908a235a-eded-40eb-8680-e8d2b3d475a7', '91b16a52-eb29-438a-abec-972372828ad6', '91d86a9d-be68-4752-a55d-8ece752233e3', '922494b7-4ffa-4896-a48d-711c955bad93', '96506af8-7800-4c80-a810-4d900913c087', '9794691e-b9f1-44b9-bb18-69a1b0803039', '984fe0a5-4201-4766-9c4c-c92519a6cdf6', '993cf4f1-c849-4b57-af8b-5b0827724630', '9a369747-98d8-41e6-b4f8-3aea32441487', '9d62a00d-b184-45de-a797-a8644fbeb326', 'ab356406-89cf-4325-98f9-72e8f31ac40e', 'aee229b3-22d9-4352-9aa3-6d826dfd1c77', 'b09be351-c20d-4623-97b3-39aa417ba5e2', 'b0d66952-1c3f-46cc-9684-8c7afed7105a', 'b10c61ad-2b76-43b8-b13f-200541a4f263', 'b2632404-9e70-4745-a64a-1c180fc7c299', 'b3696d9f-6109-46d8-9433-77609cb92246', 'b47eb1b5-d37d-40e7-90ec-a2923648f235', 'b5229e41-8082-45bd-97eb-db31538024ee', 'b65a13f3-0b12-4548-9ab5-aad5895a6543', 'b7c4e93c-f767-47bc-9209-e739c6a656de', 'b8474804-0298-4407-8ac0-d3c52f3839d2', 'ba2dbd36-ce70-4c58-9096-c905b81c7fa8', 'bbdde240-1dde-449a-ae2f-82c86240c781', 'bd95f8f9-65bd-42a0-8e23-777ac52b2b97', 'c0183ac9-2586-40b4-ad76-cb577472e3b1', 'c0cbc785-9a45-456f-bdc6-b11585ba5a01', 'c5abea96-4233-4737-812f-092881eebd67', 'c5d4baa2-501d-4f40-9256-c4ccf62a9b5a', 'cb191d39-0288-4263-a0f9-c63d5c673284', 'cfba8e0f-e06e-491c-94a8-78013ad8bb30', 'db08829d-104d-4b4b-9615-6fc1f47173e7', 'dd112b09-d832-4b48-866e-0c8eb485b972', 'df5aea9c-6f0e-457b-8670-164be3423c98', 'dfe8a6b2-0346-4129-8ca1-c21686b07492', 'e2e1a21f-fc8b-4d0c-b708-425f314874d4', 'e8dab090-f34f-43f9-9ab2-ae5ed9403a7c', 'e9573d31-9836-4897-a165-ec91ce259a02', 'ec363fb5-36b8-4438-93b7-6c9223390051', 'ecf7127c-f100-4da1-b5bb-7630d519ca25', 'eff24948-c62c-43cf-8a32-ea2a07b9c959', 'f04e17ea-355f-44c7-8bf0-1147a8b41a4a', 'f259c86e-0f8c-4773-90dd-16690c5a98f9', 'f2f586a2-5791-49e8-86e6-a5479b809310', 'f32aeae2-5fbe-4fdb-bcb5-9e4f4937b0a7', 'f3d87aaa-358c-457f-ab6f-5fe2bc99b800', 'f88b4685-1c7f-4233-80ea-082cdf64461f', 'fa1a6407-fa3b-49e0-ab38-1ca8b4fa5ecc', 'fcf11b61-a2f4-4b64-9f77-f2e3d8177b15']",Changes as First-Class Citizens: A Research Perspective on Modern Software Tooling,ACM Computing Surveys,2017
1148,"Recent advances in high-throughput genome sequencing technologies have enabled the systematic study of various genomes by making whole genome sequencing affordable. Modern sequencers generate a huge number of small sequence fragments called reads, where the read length and the per-base sequencing cost depend on the technology used. To date, many hybrid genome assembly algorithms have been developed that can take reads from multiple read sources to reconstruct the original genome. However, rigorous investigation of the feasibility conditions for complete genome reconstruction and the optimal sequencing strategy for minimizing the sequencing cost has been conspicuously missing. An important aspect of hybrid sequencing and assembly is that the feasibility conditions for genome reconstruction can be satisfied by different combinations of the available read sources, opening up the possibility of optimally combining the sources to minimize the sequencing cost while ensuring accurate genome reconstruction. In this paper, we derive the conditions for whole genome reconstruction from multiple read sources at a given confidence level and also introduce the optimal strategy for combining reads from different sources to minimize the overall sequencing cost. We show that the optimal read set, which simultaneously satisfies the feasibility conditions for genome reconstruction and minimizes the sequencing cost, can be effectively predicted through constrained discrete optimization. Through extensive evaluations based on several genomes and different read sets, we verify the derived feasibility conditions and demonstrate the performance of the proposed optimal hybrid sequencing and assembly strategy.","['Chun-Chi Chen', 'Noushin Ghaffari', 'Xiaoning Qian', 'Byung-Jun Yoon']",3cfb3515-cc63-4b36-a95a-5358baa0e39d,0,"['037c673c-5dfb-49cb-8d68-71cd0769d5b3', '12e493b0-52f1-48d4-bed9-7a811ab8fd54', '509ccc5d-c220-403b-900e-5b45de5501c3', '5ad7a8ba-fbfd-41fd-b6ed-463308691fab', '67a5632b-47a1-4045-9b36-6e8a9ff574b0', '73272155-d43a-4b68-a3b3-4bf8439cbe8d', '806701cd-0d04-4024-8c8a-54e1bc6e37d7', '9b06cfd6-a7bd-46af-8bbe-0cc52bb47ad1', 'a3ce1a01-e3ff-4a7b-8845-e99c2a775068', 'ba203a01-cb78-42f8-9e1e-d73e9fe531ff', 'da5b796e-e679-4d9b-812d-b16d1d98582b', 'ea75671b-d715-43e3-acc5-3bc47e723f2c', 'f1e4c527-319d-42b3-919f-66f4de79d4c0']",Optimal hybrid sequencing and assembly: Feasibility conditions for accurate genome reconstruction and cost minimization strategy,Computational Biology and Chemistry,2017
1149,"Background and Objective. The effective processing of biomedical images usually requires the interoperability of diverse software tools that have different aims but are complementary. The goal of this work is to develop a bridge to connect two of those tools: ImageJ, a program for image analysis in life sciences, and OpenCV, a computer vision and machine learning library.#R##N##R##N#Methods. Based on a thorough analysis of ImageJ and OpenCV, we detected the features of these systems that could be enhanced, and developed a library to combine both tools, taking advantage of the strengths of each system. The library was implemented on top of the SciJava converter framework. We also provide a methodology to use this library.#R##N##R##N#Results. We have developed the publicly available library IJ-OpenCV that can be employed to create applications combining features from both ImageJ and OpenCV. From the perspective of ImageJ developers, they can use IJ-OpenCV to easily create plugins that use any functionality provided by the OpenCV library and explore different alternatives. From the perspective of OpenCV developers, this library provides a link to the ImageJ graphical user interface and all its features to handle regions of interest.#R##N##R##N#Conclusions. The IJ-OpenCV library bridges the gap between ImageJ and OpenCV, allowing the connection and the cooperation of these two systems.","['César Domínguez', 'Jónathan Heras', 'Vico Pascual']",b41fede8-fe37-4871-8bff-eeb0b05f7fe0,0,"['017c12b7-7210-4bc4-aa13-78496f68cfa0', '1c63e1d5-b963-455b-829d-e4f3eb63a36a', '33fb6f6d-347a-415a-a4c6-25ae76c72d51', '6c323df9-e7ad-4708-b4c0-160920c92070', '8cd1ea21-ffb7-4db6-860b-6226d82d06ae', 'd03052e5-85a1-41be-8646-e61315c57d27', 'd10b3a0c-89b4-4f8f-a02a-dda494725976', 'd9409dae-3401-4456-ac25-fd1429ecf2d6', 'e770b001-2497-4e09-899d-7a29ab2cfc46', 'ece1aa21-9eba-4bb2-8c5f-1c247640a8d4', 'f984c859-1864-494f-a383-160670e03fe3', 'fcf49ca7-61dd-477a-ae95-a478f45bba16']",IJ-OpenCV: Combining ImageJ and OpenCV for processing images in biomedicine,Computers in Biology and Medicine,2017
1150,"This paper develops a quaternion attitude tracking control with an adaptive gains parameter that can be tuned to compensate for disturbances with known bound. The adaptive gain is described by a simple, but singular, differential equation and the corresponding adaptive control is shown to asymptotically track a reference attitude. However, this control requires the bound on the disturbance torque to be known in order to appropriately tune the controller to compensate for it. Using a linear state observer to estimate the disturbance torque and compensating for the disturbance at each sampling period the adaptive control can achieve asymptotic tracking in the presence of an unknown disturbance torque. In this case the error in the estimation, rather than the entire disturbance, is compensated for by the adaptive gain at each sampling period. Simulations demonstrate that an improved tracking performance can be achieved when compared to standard quaternion tracking controls.","['Yuliang Bai', 'James Biggs', 'Xiaogang Wang', 'Naigang Cui']",d383ea99-9732-4f39-b789-e0987674c9c3,0,"['19e2cbba-484e-4243-9179-cd6aea5740a0', '28225ca0-1e1f-471f-917d-4db06c1ad91c', '5572f485-ca2d-49c6-b298-d96e74fb66b2', '67ec8ce5-a2bc-47bc-9977-93e7e0374ff4', '852a57ad-5cd4-40f1-b25f-870b17ef897c', '9dd8d9ae-8488-455b-bc65-edcfadc2cb0d', 'ca1a1304-df41-453a-ac20-87064c826c47', 'd95fbb9f-3f08-46bd-ab5c-93001f545ad7']",A singular adaptive attitude control with active disturbance rejection,European Journal of Control,2017
1151,"Recognizing semantic category of objects and scenes captured using vision-based sensors is a challenging yet essential capability for mobile robots and UAVs to perform high-level tasks such as long-term autonomous navigation. However, extracting discriminative features from multi-modal inputs, such as RGB-D images, in a unified manner is non-trivial given the heterogeneous nature of the modalities. We propose a deep network which seeks to construct a joint and shared multi-modal representation through bilinearly combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) streams of the RGB and depth channels. This technique motivates bilateral transfer learning between the modalities by taking the outer product of each feature extractor output. Furthermore, we devise a technique for multi-scale feature abstraction using deeply supervised branches which are connected to all convolutional layers of the multi-stream CNN. We show that end-to-end learning of the network is feasible even with a limited amount of training data and the trained network generalizes across different datasets and applications.

1152,"We consider a thermodynamic consistent multi-component model in multi-dimensions that is a generalization of the classical two-phase flow model of Baer and Nunziato. The exchange of mass, momentum and energy between the phases is described by additional source terms. Typically these terms are handled by relaxation procedures. Available relaxation procedures suffer from efficiency and robustness resulting in very costly computations that in general only allow for one-dimensional computations. Therefore we focus on the development of new efficient and robust numerical methods for relaxation processes. We derive exact procedures to determine mechanical and thermal equilibrium states. Further we introduce a novel iterative method to treat the mass transfer for a three component mixture. All new procedures can be extended to an arbitrary number of inert ideal gases. We prove existence, uniqueness and physical admissibility of the resulting states and convergence of our new procedures. Efficiency and robustness of the procedures are verified by means of numerical computations in one and two space dimensions.","['Ee Han', 'Maren Hantke', 'Siegfried Müller']",68579d07-aad8-44eb-86ba-799f82d63188,0,"['21a10b2a-204e-448f-b325-31ed8c49c10f', 'a26218cf-dbea-4f89-a23b-14dac47fae6a', 'fea972b0-ef49-4f04-9eb1-1f6aed244e74']",Efficient and robust relaxation procedures for multi-component mixtures including phase transition,Journal of Computational Physics,2017

1154,"Common mental health consequences following the experience of potentially traumatic events include Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and addictive behaviors. Problematic smartphone use is a newer manifestation of addictive behaviors. People with anxiety severity (such as PTSD) may be at risk for problematic smartphone use as a means of coping with their symptoms. Unique to our knowledge, we assessed relations between PTSD symptom clusters and problematic smartphone use. Participants (N = 347), recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), completed measures of PTSD and smartphone addiction. Results of the Wald tests of parameter constraints indicated that problematic smartphone use was more related to PTSD’s negative alterations in cognitions and mood (NACM) than to PTSD’s avoidance factor, Wald χ2(1, N = 347) = 12.51, p = 0.0004; and more to PTSD’s arousal compared to PTSD’s avoidance factor, Wald χ2(1, N = 347) = 14.89, p = 0.0001. Results indicate that problematic smartphone use is most associated with negative affect and arousal among trauma-exposed individuals. Implications include the need to clinically assess problematic smartphone use among trauma-exposed individuals presenting with higher NACM and arousal severity; and targeting NACM and arousal symptoms to mitigate the effects of problematic smartphone use.","['Ateka A.

1155,"Image compositing enables the generation of continuous and equidistant time series of vegetation indices (VIs) as a requisite for deriving phenological metrics. This is achieved by selecting a representative choice from available observations within a compositing period. Commonly, phenological processors associate the VI value with a reference date rather than the actual acquisition date. This letter focuses on a global assessment of the resulting temporal discrepancy between the assumed reference date and the actual acquisition date using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-VI day of composite (DOC) information from 2000 to 2015. It is shown that the long-term global mean DOC coincides with the midday of a compositing period (day 8.44 ± 0.44). The global summarized 2-D frequency distributions of succeeding compositing periods revealed that only 16.93% of all occurrences indicate a 16-day difference. The commonly used assumptions that the DOC coincides with the first, mid, or last day of the compositing period on average only hold true for 7.02%, 6.07%, and 6.03% of temporal succeeding compositing periods, respectively. Spatial patterns of 2-D frequency distributions occur as a result of climatic regions and seasonality. A MODIS tile is on average composed of more than 50% DOC combinations, indicating deviations (1–31 days) from the 16-day difference. Since information about the actual acquisition date is available, and methods for the incorporation of irregular data into phenological analysis do exist, it is recommended to incorporate this information into the phenology research based on VI time series to avoid unnecessary uncertainty.","['Erik Hab', 'David Frantz', 'Sebastian Mader', 'Joachim Hill']",1bd822e2-685c-4cc5-9624-14981504034d,0,['900cb6c9-95e7-46c5-b66d-02894866f676'],Global Analysis of the Differences Between the MODIS Vegetation Index Compositing Date and the Actual Acquisition Date,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
1156,"In this paper, we present an improved two-level heuristic to solve the clustered vehicle routing problem (CluVRP). The CluVRP is a generalization of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) in which customers are grouped into predefined clusters, and all customers in a cluster must be served consecutively by the same vehicle. This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways: (i) new upper bounds are presented for multiple benchmark instances, (ii) good heuristic solutions are provided in much smaller computing times than existing approaches, (iii) the CluVRP is reduced to its cluster level without assuming Euclidean coordinates or distances, and (iv) a new variant of the CluVRP, the CluVRPwith weak cluster constraints, is introduced. In this variant, clusters are allocated to vehicles in their entirety, but all corresponding customers can be visited by the vehicle in any order.#R##N##R##N#The proposed heuristic solves the CluVRP by combining two variable neighborhood search algorithms, that explore the solution space at the cluster level and the individual customer level respectively.

1157,"Facial behavior consists of dynamically changing properties of facial features as a result of muscle activation. Facial behavior analysis is a challenging problem due to complexity of emotions and variability of the facial expressions associated with the emotions. Most facial expression recognition systems attempt to recognize facial expressions without taking into account the intensity of the expressions. In this paper, a novel framework for facial expression recognition and intensity estimation with low computational complexity requirement is proposed. The algorithm constructs a representation of facial features based on a weighted voting scheme and employs Hidden Markov Models to classify an input video into one of the six basic expressions, namely anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The temporal segments, neutral, onset, and apex, of an expression are then obtained by means of a change-point detector. Evaluations on subject-independent analysis was conducted using Cohn-Kanade dataset and Beihang University facial expression datasets. The proposed approach has demonstrated a superior performance in recognizing facial expressions and estimating expression intensities.","['Siti Khairuni Amalina Kamarol', 'Mohamed Hisham Jaward', 'Heikki Kälviäinen', 'Jussi Parkkinen', 'Rajendran Parthiban']",ca2ccb96-0db8-46dd-bb7e-64c5a96bbeea,0,"['172c9cd4-f230-4e13-90d9-6bc30f1bf304', '1be1c732-9d9e-4342-bcce-610d1a810e1b', '2a2602ee-9c12-4066-8735-64a211242fbe', '41560928-fe86-4c36-8082-002e940170a6', '571440cc-8616-4b0d-82d8-f6351fb45988', '861793fe-37ee-49b5-9110-714b58dc74cf', '88339c9a-620d-42ed-a63a-788f883019ca', '8f7bdf3b-2c51-4ecb-86ea-6c0c5fce98f6', '9439a1eb-8311-47a3-8aa6-750ec4436f6a', 'a0ff838c-d1e5-43f6-8008-f7e96e810e62', 'a7b12c17-82f7-4af9-a5ed-6b9cdf0797b3', 'a8eebac2-a4e1-42a4-bc8f-6bedd8b8d1fd', 'b7e6d95c-71ff-44b4-8ff3-a0186f0fb1ff', 'bf03f268-de9d-4a80-aee1-200990056503', 'c0254e85-c190-4180-933a-dcda27f54ccd', 'ccd81047-1a3a-4af4-bd55-4cd1a97378e5', 'e81c5267-b7d3-4c00-951f-fe4dc8ecaa83', 'f4e394ca-7462-4ddc-8570-30526aef4c8b', 'ff1b1b24-965e-4677-8a6e-74ff5d631f7c']",Joint facial expression recognition and intensity estimation based on weighted votes of image sequences,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017
1158,Limitations of approximation capabilities of shallow perceptron networks are investigated. Lower bounds on approximation errors are derived for binary-valued functions on finite domains. It is proven that unless the number of network units is sufficiently large (larger than any polynomial of the logarithm of the size of the domain) a good approximation cannot be achieved for almost any uniformly randomly chosen function on a given domain. The results are obtained by combining probabilistic Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds with estimates of the sizes of sets of functions exactly computable by shallow networks with increasing numbers of units.,"['Věra Kůrková', 'Marcello Sanguineti']",5f5a659a-1cb6-4841-9976-0a38e477f53b,0,"['080b72fa-e768-4fda-bb56-e242a89f682b', '0c7e79a5-15c3-4045-a535-9c079cc3605c', '1f25fb00-3e95-4d36-9908-2e6935e4d470', '23875f5e-7f3b-40e9-8f6a-bcf99d5d0a19', '3715c870-6569-4d20-8797-af8569e5fde5', '4297ab6e-ca29-4311-85fe-2e0fa2b08022', '44663ab5-3396-43fe-8579-c9988a2cba25', '640bfef8-3c8b-4f57-8db8-5184529ffe1b', '75a875ab-8694-4fee-a2e6-df51bc7a7a75', '7a8f19c7-faa4-444e-bacd-7eb02c541890', '8066bbe8-8eb2-43d9-86a4-cb39b908b9b2', '89f10062-acf1-4171-b882-f3222c3a357e', '91ca1081-30ec-4104-9615-ea3ee9defca8', 'a81c93d2-0d60-4ab4-aac0-57fe750fe54b', 'bbb78c63-0d0a-45f4-9ad0-7ed2b081b050', 'c1f9f9b9-f092-4885-b28a-c5cc80a3fb41', 'd0cfe861-c837-4ac1-88b6-01ce18c2cfee', 'd28acb36-5766-4c1e-8d57-a55c2630bd90', 'd6e82e0c-3ef2-427a-88b0-8a6a29d65d8c', 'db3572c6-2a7e-47d7-9aec-1f57291c55d5', 'f5117362-4e87-4f6b-8bfd-aed4a96e0a25']",Probabilistic lower bounds for approximation by shallow perceptron networks,Neural Networks,2017
1159,"The training of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) concerns the selection of their structures and the connection weights. To efficiently enhance generalization capabilities of RNNs, a recurrent self-organizing neural networks (RSONN), using an adaptive growing and pruning algorithm (AGPA), is proposed for improving their performance in this paper. This AGPA can self-organize the structures of RNNs based on the information processing ability and competitiveness of hidden neurons in the learning process. Then, the hidden neurons of RSONN can be added or pruned to improve the generalization performance. Furthermore, an adaptive second-order algorithm with adaptive learning rate is employed to adjust the parameters of RSONN. And the convergence of RSONN is given to show the computational efficiency. To demonstrate the merits of RSONN for data modeling, several benchmark datasets and a real world application associated with nonlinear systems modeling problems are examined with comparisons against other existing methods. Experimental results show that the proposed RSONN effectively simplifies the network structure and performs better than some exiting methods.","['Hong-Gui Han', 'Shuo Zhang', 'Jun-Fei Qiao']",6fe96e24-4bbc-4109-9c16-1116521f04f5,0,"['07cef9ee-8601-4a6d-9e4b-2c2035724606', '16b01494-3082-4ae9-8efb-15708fdcd5bd', '1e7eccbd-6aa7-4054-8146-a68d9e44bf0a', '264c9fc7-f1cf-4e51-aecf-443bf8f426fa', '279cf6ce-2da3-486f-87fb-0c4923d15b9d', '288b7291-471c-446a-acb7-23233b7fd1f5', '3155743f-419e-4135-bbbb-75486bcc4f2a', '39b41738-f415-4310-854a-3f557799b912', '45c12730-2560-4bf4-bd09-17c844e2e76b', '4f23b333-7805-4812-aefc-5394d9ea4198', '559e9839-5058-4cec-94c1-3fc6f63dced5', '58af436d-9087-424c-8646-c5931cbc0c4b', '5c222ddc-5993-43c2-9fc2-88af890bda62', '5d60f75a-0af8-4f41-92f2-4d2d948ac285', '66151cdc-ad07-409b-9559-c6950c02124b', '76ffdc16-0f27-483d-8b88-a0dddbe97d87', '77c3f5b9-f40e-4c04-bbce-ad31104b7bbb', '7d93cb08-ca67-4e55-a38f-44516a5688ca', '89703b8e-e42f-401f-9bec-7772a7cdcdd2', '98bc4b2d-3c4b-4108-9f7c-e02c2ebba5c3', '9990daf4-3ed2-44a1-b8e5-7234ac590951', '9af1c940-0cdf-452f-a906-d3ca91a5418d', 'b6c50d72-c7b6-4c7e-a5a4-faca2eed1dab', 'bbabac4a-0eb2-4be7-b399-8d9589a0e19c', 'bc8c350b-1904-44d6-bb67-1dea7995d801', 'c15e02b7-4d3a-405e-a1ea-28fcab282195', 'ca59a4dd-4b69-4774-9932-40ce6e2f02ac', 'ca78d361-8e2e-41b0-937d-f914d53e4d0e', 'd5f354b5-2ae5-41da-a145-f62e1f6ce134', 'd83abedd-cf07-4120-b70d-1ce4f720b8cb', 'f0f2d0e8-5ded-4ebb-8eb7-9cf385db04bd', 'f8ab7753-f559-4837-b205-850558c5a1ba', 'f932d94a-6da0-45ec-9638-180255f14760', 'f953c66e-f3e2-4bac-9e90-b2ee1c38ed46', 'ffa88acb-4b20-443a-92c4-7ef04d6d7fff', 'ffff42a4-1347-4c97-a468-587a58b1b494']",An adaptive growing and pruning algorithm for designing recurrent neural network,Neurocomputing,2017
1160,"Knowledge of HLA haplotypes is helpful in many settings as disease association studies, population genetics, or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Regarding the recruitment of unrelated hematopoietic stem cell donors, HLA haplotype frequencies of specific populations are used to optimize both donor searches for individual patients and strategic donor registry planning. However, the estimation of haplotype frequencies from HLA genotyping data is challenged by the large amount of genotype data, the complex HLA nomenclature, and the heterogeneous and ambiguous nature of typing records. To meet these challenges, we have developed the open-source software Hapl-o-Mat. It estimates haplotype frequencies from population data including an arbitrary number of loci using an expectation-maximization algorithm. Its key features are the processing of different HLA typing resolutions within a given population sample and the handling of ambiguities recorded via multiple allele codes or genotype list strings. Implemented in C++, Hapl-o-Mat facilitates efficient haplotype frequency estimation from large amounts of genotype data. We demonstrate its accuracy and performance on the basis of artificial and real genotype data. Hapl-o-Mat is a versatile and efficient software for HLA haplotype frequency estimation. Its capability of processing various forms of HLA genotype data allows for a straightforward haplotype frequency estimation from typing records usually found in stem cell donor registries.","['Christian Schäfer', 'Alexander H.

1162,"Important journals usually guide the research and development directions in academic circles. Therefore, it is necessary to find the important journals among a number of academic journals. This study presents a model named the multiple-link, mutually reinforced journal-ranking (MLMRJR) model based on the PageRank and the Hyperlink-Induced Topics Search algorithms that considers not only the quantity and quality of citations in intra-networks, but also the mutual reinforcement in inter-networks. First, the multiple links between four intra-networks and three inter-networks of paper, author, and journal are involved simultaneously. Second, a time factor is added to the paper citation network as the weight of the edges to solve the rank bias problem of the PageRank algorithm. Third, the author citation network and the co-authorship network are considered simultaneously. The results of a case study showed that the proposed MLMRJR model can obtain a reasonable journal ranking based on Spearman’s and Kendall’s ranking correlation coefficient and ROC curve analysis. This study provides a systematic view of such field from the perspective of measuring the prestige of journals, which can help researchers decide where to view publications and publish their papers, and help journal editors and organizations evaluate the quality of other journals and focus on the strengths of their own journals.","['Dejian Yu', 'Wanru Wang', 'Shuai Zhang', 'Wenyu Zhang', 'Rongyu Liu']",c4588cc1-9e76-46ef-9756-a92dfa779f9b,0,"['058c77b5-9026-485f-b6e1-1d60bfbcd1c4', '143475bb-fa04-4573-a9fd-28c8e13234ea', '15902fad-8dc1-4370-bae9-c19a6a0c3672', '1adb572c-253e-4ba9-a2b9-7c9a4aba4a0c', '2840a7a8-f36e-405d-8b2d-4415d8a8c0b2', '31e51b03-6695-4f55-bb43-6427392e5f46', '464acc6f-8eae-41c6-b360-990739da3224', '4735fa71-649c-483d-9925-61bd24b612b0', '61ba19c4-d5a3-433d-b355-dc395b01a4ca', '6cbd879b-32e4-4f75-bddf-d53c6efb3237', '767f8104-cdf1-43dd-8c14-e8ce66d58d85', '77935bd7-f1a3-4314-88db-bb95cd05987d', '7b3ddafa-d77c-4e8d-9942-0748ba593f3a', '8f9e92cf-f266-4e51-807f-c098a260a0dc', '95bc3e97-a490-4cb4-90aa-70cf4449841c', '9ad1ead6-94b9-48cf-9158-42e29b21cb62', 'a266fa4a-d78b-45a6-9b70-404143690e9b', 'a5de5f81-ca6f-437e-bf6b-488fca12d867', 'b153df16-dace-4ef7-842a-7fae1330c87f', 'b7aef9d5-de58-415b-945b-c3e72a8d4c2e', 'bab5ffb5-5f2d-4afb-b630-1fc6d9b5b4a1', 'bfbbc4d4-2de7-4fba-b2da-47aac8af8ca8', 'c7e4e04b-45da-4bae-8c8a-d17ca0087361', 'd194966e-870e-49df-893f-1b3ed313fbbe', 'dda72fd7-7a68-4be0-ab89-60093c217f33', 'e3a6d145-dff0-4dd2-8c82-c4b04a473cc7', 'e6a6a2c7-a829-4ca0-9d97-052526cc8826', 'e6d67555-d968-4d7c-b79f-837fa55bc43b', 'f31ab617-8eab-482e-ae10-d0f4cb5a41c3']","A multiple-link, mutually reinforced journal-ranking model to measure the prestige of journals",Scientometrics,2017

1166,"In the present work, an automated method to diagnose Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals is proposed. This method is based on Flexible Analytic Wavelet Transform (FAWT), which decomposes the HRV signals into different sub-band signals. Further, Accumulated Fuzzy Entropy (AFEnt) and Accumulated Permutation Entropy (APEnt) are computed over cumulative sums of these sub-band signals. This provides complexity analysis using fuzzy and permutation entropies at different frequency scales. We have extracted 20 features from these signals obtained at different frequency scales of HRV signals. The Bhattacharyya ranking method is used to rank the extracted features from the HRV signals of three different lengths (500, 1000 and 2000 samples). These ranked features are fed to the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier. Our proposed system has obtained a sensitivity of 98.07%, specificity of 98.33% and accuracy of 98.21% for the 500-sample length of HRV signals.

1169,"The accuracy of metagenomic assembly is usually compromised by high levels of polymorphism due to divergent reads from the same genomic region recognized as different loci when sequenced and assembled together. A viral quasispecies is a group of abundant and diversified genetically related viruses found in a single carrier. Current mainstream assembly methods, such as Velvet and SOAPdenovo, were not originally intended for the assembly of such metagenomics data, and therefore demands for new methods to provide accurate and informative assembly results for metagenomic data. In this study, we present a hybrid method for assembling highly polymorphic data combining the partial de novo-reference assembly (PDR) strategy and the BLAST-based assembly pipeline (BBAP). The PDR strategy generates in situ reference sequences through de novo assembly of a randomly extracted partial data set which is subsequently used for the reference assembly for the full data set. BBAP employs a greedy algorithm to assemble polymorphic reads. We used 12 hepatitis B virus quasispecies NGS data sets from a previous study to assess and compare the performance of both PDR and BBAP. Analyses suggest the high polymorphism of a full metagenomic data set leads to fragmentized de novo assembly results, whereas the biased or limited representation of external reference sequences included fewer reads into the assembly with lower assembly accuracy and variation sensitivity. In comparison, the PDR generated in situ reference sequence incorporated more reads into the final PDR assembly of the full metagenomics data set along with greater accuracy and higher variation sensitivity. BBAP assembly results also suggest higher assembly efficiency and accuracy compared to other assembly methods. Additionally, BBAP assembly recovered HBV structural variants that were not observed amongst assembly results of other methods. Together, PDR/BBAP assembly results were significantly better than other compared methods. Both PDR and BBAP independently increased the assembly efficiency and accuracy of highly polymorphic data, and assembly performances were further improved when used together. BBAP also provides nucleotide frequency information. Together, PDR and BBAP provide powerful tools for metagenomic data studies.","['You-Yu Lin', 'Chia-Hung Hsieh', 'Jiun-Hong Chen', 'Xuemei Lu', 'Jia-Horng Kao', 'Pei-Jer Chen', 'Ding-Shinn Chen', 'Hurng-Yi Wang']",5f21f59c-fb86-4edc-bdbc-789b78e0730a,0,"['936c2524-60cb-438c-b553-b5d2371e5dff', 'a3a51398-5ca7-4450-bc2f-68a61b5ebda1']",De novo assembly of highly polymorphic metagenomic data using in situ generated reference sequences and a novel BLAST-based assembly pipeline,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
1170,"This study investigates the relationship between characteristics of the firm’s top management team (TMT) and its research and development (R&D) activities. Specifically, this research analyzes how observable characteristics of the TMT, such as functional experiences or educational background, and average tenure affect the firm’s proportion of explorative R&D activities. From the perspective of the upper-echelon theory, we hypothesize that the TMT’s functional experiences with R&D or science or engineering educational backgrounds increase the firm’s tendency towards explorative R&D. Moreover, we propose that the average tenure of TMT members with innovation-related experiences would have a positive moderation effects on these relationships. The hypotheses are tested using a dataset containing biographical information of the TMT members, financial, and patent data of 89 firms in U.S. high-tech industries from 2006 to 2009. Firm’s explorative R&D activities are analyzed using data on patent citations, patent classes, and non-patent references. The empirical analysis shows that the top managers’ educational background in science or engineering as well as their previous functional experiences with R&D have a positive effect on the firm’s explorative innovation activities. We also find that the size of these effects increases with a longer tenure of these TMT members. Our findings provide implications related to the effects of organizational characteristics on the establishment of a R&D strategy and highlight the role of TMT members with innovative experiences in directing a firm’s R&D activities and outcomes.","['Chul Lee', 'Gunno Park', 'Klaus Marhold', 'Jina Kang']",cb91e2b7-042a-4dc3-9aa5-51a4312926a8,0,"['116981bf-e2ba-4679-ac3d-3533f978e7c0', '1b5759e8-5d28-433d-880f-a54b254bde28', '223b46c4-1f16-4509-ab01-ceeb62084f1c', '3025a7d1-91e4-41f5-99c5-598d6699e1bd', '4cab4a4c-86de-46e4-8387-43d5c4311446', '71dcf3ea-f3bb-438f-90b0-ecc35e7c452a', '734cc9ab-e2a6-47f4-a18b-3dea6c0b4299', 'a22a4b9c-0aa8-4ea4-90fb-baf688f325f1', 'a7eea7c5-7e75-4f48-9af4-c6243c6fbd1d', 'bd7d71fa-267f-4e8c-8dc3-9c8df858fb13', 'c123d428-d4d6-4924-ad6a-ef7a1e8c383a', 'fa3930e3-67f2-435d-9c60-e62c569556ee']",Top management team’s innovation-related characteristics and the firm’s explorative R&D: an analysis based on patent data,Scientometrics,2017

1173,"This paper analyses the complexity of multivariate electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in different frequency scales for the analysis and classification of focal and non-focal EEG signals. The proposed multivariate sub-band entropy measure has been built based on tunable-Q wavelet transform (TQWT). In the field of multivariate entropy analysis, recent studies have performed analysis of biomedical signals with a multi-level filtering approach. This approach has become a useful tool for measuring inherent complexity of the biomedical signals. However, these methods may not be well suited for quantifying the complexity of the individual multivariate sub-bands of the analysed signal. In this present study, we have tried to resolve this difficulty by employing TQWT for analysing the sub-band signals of the analysed multivariate signal. It should be noted that higher value of Q factor is suitable for analysing signals with oscillatory nature, whereas the lower value of Q factor is suitable for analysing signals with non-oscillatory transients in nature. Moreover, with an increased number of sub-bands and a higher value of Q-factor, a reasonably good resolution can be achieved simultaneously in high and low frequency regions of the considered signals. Finally, we have employed multivariate fuzzy entropy (mvFE) to the multivariate sub-band signals obtained from the analysed signal. The proposed Q-based multivariate sub-band entropy has been studied on the publicly available bivariate Bern Barcelona focal and non-focal EEG signals database to investigate the statistical significance of the proposed features in different time segmented signals. Finally, the features are fed to random forest and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers to select the best classifier.

1174,"This paper seeks to contemplate a sequence of steps in connecting the fields of science, technology and industrial products. A method for linking different classifications (WoS–IPC–ISIC concordance) is proposed. The ensuing concordance tables inherit the roots of Grupp’s perspective on science, technology, product and market. The study contextualized the linking process as it can be instrumental for policy planning and technology targeting. The presented method allows us to postulate the potential development of technology in science and industrial products. The proposed method and organized concordance tables are intended as a guiding tool for policy makers to study the prospects of a technology or industry of interest. Two perceived high potential technologies—traditional medicine and ICT—that were sought by two aspirant economies—Hong Kong and Malaysia—are considered as case studies for the proposed method. The selected cases provide us the context of what technological research is being pursued for both fundamental knowledge and new industries. They enable us to understand the context of policy planning and targeting for sectoral and regional innovation systems. While we note the constraints of using joint-publishing and joint-patenting data to study the core competencies of developing economies and their potential for development, we realize that the proposed method enables us to highlight the gaps between science and technology and the core competencies of the selected economies, as well as their prospects in terms of technology and product development. The findings provide useful policy implications for further development of the respective cases.","['C. S.

1175,"For multi-model multisensor systems with both the uncertain-variance multiplicative and linearly correlated additive white noises, a universal fictitious noise-based Lyapunov equation approach is presented, by which the original system can be converted into one with only uncertain additive noise variances, and then the local and four weighted fused minimax robust time-varying Kalman estimators (predictor, filter and smoother) of the common state are presented in a unified framework, where the robust Kalman filter and smoother are designed based on the robust Kalman predictor. They include the three fusers weighted by matrices, scalars and diagonal matrices, and a modified Covariance Intersection(CI) fuser. Their robustness is proved in the sense that their actual estimation error variances are guaranteed to have the corresponding minimal upper bounds for all admissible uncertainties. Their accuracy relations are proved. The corresponding local and fused robust steady-state Kalman estimators also are presented. The convergence analysis is also given.

1177,"It has been repeatedly suggested that the common cause-and-effect approach to evaluating process safety has deficiencies that could be addressed by a systems engineering perspective. A systems approach should consider safety as a system-wide property and thus would be required to integrate all aspects of the process involved with monitoring or manipulating the process dynamics, including the control, alarm, and emergency shut-down systems while operating them independently for redundancy. In this work, we propose initial steps in the first systems safety approach that coordinates the control and safety systems through a common metric (a Safeness Index) and develop a controller formulation that incorporates this index. Specifically, this work presents an economic model predictive control (EMPC) scheme that utilizes a Safeness Index function as a hard constraint to define a safe region of operation termed the safety zone. Under the proposed EMPC design, the closed-loop state of a nonlinear process is guaranteed to enter the safety zone in finite time in the presence of uncertainty while maximizing a stage cost that reflects the economics of the process. Closed-loop stability is established for a nonlinear process under the proposed implementation strategy.","['Fahad Albalawi', 'Helen Durand', 'Panagiotis D.

1178,"Context: Successful organizations need to manage and synchronize their strategic objectives with daily operations and activities. In general, achieving that requires a continuous process of organizational alignment. GQM+Strategies is an approach that helps software organizations with documenting and aligning organizational goals and strategies, and developing measurement programs. Objective: In this paper, the GQM+Strategies approach is further evolved and extended to include capabilities to evaluate the relationships of organizational goals and strategies through causal analysis. Method: We used an analytical paradigm to develop a formal causal model over the GQM+Strategies structure. In addition, an empirical pre-experimental study was designed to test practitioners’ abilities to provide necessary input for the formal causal model. Results: A developed formal causal model over the GQM+Strategies structure allows the use of causal reasoning for the purpose of analyzing dependencies among chosen sets of goals. We illustrate this by showing how to analyze the impact of risky goals on other goals in the grid. The results of the empirical study showed that the practitioners had no difficulties providing their predictions, i.e. inputs into the causal model. Conclusion: The proposed solution extends the existing GQM+Strategies knowledge base by further elaborating and clarifying the process of creating grids by introducing causality theory. The use of causality theory allows experts to quantify their knowledge and beliefs regarding the effectiveness of organizational strategies. As a part of future work, formal causal models and causal reasoning can be implemented as a supporting software tool for the GQM+Strategies approach.","['Vladimir Mandić', 'Nebojša Gvozdenović']",540baa64-ffa5-46c7-8c38-c3bfcd5aceb1,0,"['0388dca0-e697-47d1-9cde-cd4cc6b72150', '03a289ae-7fc6-417d-84e2-42fa12102654', '0c12b967-c7a9-428a-a61c-f782375f578f', '13d447d7-96c0-41ed-9c72-de18f89dacd6', '15c08d0f-e31f-4c00-a028-e80a966055ff', '16f382ba-2cda-488a-86f7-1dae2280027d', '2819d0c5-ecb8-47bf-a039-6ae12e308990', '47480301-5660-4a66-81c3-06ca1a3f125c', '5162e64a-d2a1-4f80-8fd0-25ead12334ef', '5487ce81-bf0c-4aa5-8916-8b1d4145b019', '6891735d-1664-4f04-9a41-cfb233f9b378', '7b71dec8-00c9-48c7-9c05-0e842fc47f6f', '803acd7a-74d2-4906-a714-79e90efd535d', '95bc5921-8816-46c5-91b2-318e324f3ff2', '95c6fe92-71c0-4e38-9b00-dd70a0040020', 'a3d9deb5-5e69-4c9e-b952-34b85c2df2a7', 'a50e0e7a-2de4-4167-a6b0-739936b98a09', 'a6ee8425-3dd3-40fd-b9bb-214632f04a1a', 'b1aba830-83d6-49d4-85df-2e51643ab015', 'bb1cdfca-11ca-4dd2-8e7d-5d326f143007', 'bf45174c-4869-42d4-8f50-c8c0af8e2c43', 'c40c88c4-e156-4068-82a7-d1fd8fc0846c', 'd041ff2b-331d-4eae-aaaa-8445284eede9', 'd4160f52-285e-4314-9fec-4d73bde64887', 'd561f0a7-12ce-407d-bb85-feea68808b19', 'ea411224-41ed-4a7d-ad2c-21e8beb0ccf0', 'ed812a8e-4cc6-45b3-8cc3-c2f0e1cef4ce', 'f271abb4-6910-4431-972d-6c1970dfda4c', 'f682070b-0705-4341-9b3f-0e3767db887f', 'ff8edda4-0e13-4cc5-b4c8-8851f3c24620', 'ffd8f66c-fb94-47a0-90a8-752332d7a09a']",An extension of the GQM+Strategies approach with formal causal reasoning,Information & Software Technology,2017

This is achieved without reference to a ground truth, since we have to assume the existence of multiple, equally important, valid perspectives and want to avoid bias through the adoption of an ad-hoc yardstick. Instead, we apply different ways to quantitatively and visually compare solutions to explore their commonalities and differences and develop hypotheses about the origin of these differences.

Although this numerical Bayesian method, namely reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm has been used with success in various model selection problems, our use is in a novel context in the sense that both memory size and nonlinearity degree are estimated. The aforementioned study ensures an anomalous approach to RJMCMC and provides a new understanding on its flexible use which enables trans-structural transitions between different classes of models in addition to transdimensional transitions for which it is classically used. We study the performance of the method on synthetically generated data including OFDM communications over a nonlinear channel.","['Oktay Karakuş', 'Ercan E. Kuruoglu', 'Mustafa A.

1183,"Objective video quality assessment (VQA) plays an important role in controlling video quality. Most of the existing VQA methods measure motion-related temporal distortion based on optical-flow methods, which are not consistently reliable in modeling general visual dynamics. This paper presents a full-reference temporal distortion measure based on spacetime texture, a uniform and distributive descriptor of a broad set of spacetime structures. Our method measures the distortion of spacetime texture in video with a motion-tuning strategy, which effectively captures temporal distortion along the motion trajectories. Then it estimates self-information based visual saliency for spatial pooling by reusing the motion descriptors. We evaluated our method on two public VQA databases with a wide variety of distortion types, in which the videos were viewed on a large screen or mobile devices. The results show that our method correlates highly with the subjective quality and has high computational efficiency.","['Peng Peng', 'Danping Liao', 'Ze-Nian Li']",a8afced4-ce3c-4c2b-b0bf-e97fb23448ae,0,"['24789af0-f915-4777-b9b5-df400c119319', '32655b15-be42-4fdc-aa3b-0feecdbb6295', '3ea9991a-0896-474e-9423-28e18c665d43', '40c9ced3-1259-4f91-afc5-a8b076940948', '493c3158-4455-4b13-b753-1bece7869658', '577ef2d0-9162-45e5-9a0c-4b452772fb75', '58ba29ce-2ad8-46d9-a56a-dcb7b0c43bf5', '6033ac2c-156d-45fb-bd05-a24a32ad98e5', '6454b247-01da-4658-bf8e-d2ad30838e29', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '7f5a1680-dafa-48b3-a315-65cb0e689720', '84997f76-8c4c-4ee2-b088-6e1e8b882062', '84c83c9c-f548-4f4a-a895-1f3ba5743afe', '8d03e417-a51d-4861-8820-71300520b6f4', '9103262a-bb10-4155-b6e0-d507ec8cb613', '92a12747-f9f9-4017-b226-8c2144b5cd08', '959221a0-cdbb-4835-ba35-bcae20d709f1', '9809c1c3-4272-4108-b8c3-e0bbb2d21f29', '9a6be43b-3939-4a4b-bf47-6ec8a96b50b7', 'a02408ac-4722-4491-bc1b-07d5b0f48e82', 'a21df40f-614d-4024-87d7-d3026fcdb225', 'a3218d27-3254-4f93-bd89-59b15468b1a7', 'aa70844c-b525-43af-a8e0-e6d0434341be', 'b089cee9-e45b-43ed-a180-16a1756914eb', 'bc0edae5-d8e2-4c71-a28f-099460ced6cc', 'd7e06be5-ea28-469e-8788-a80dfb97c8f3', 'db0a3fe9-17ad-4d7c-aa7a-cf2471ae9fe9', 'e05bb01f-e0e9-4940-8ef3-b518dc05ed8f', 'e5e7eed8-095a-4b19-b8a9-4ca203fb6810', 'e85e73ad-0d57-48a9-b913-7dd583619bce', 'f0342afa-4e80-4d43-a164-73606512f3d3', 'f4b91537-9ec1-4784-8763-e379329f1523', 'fa5c1c2e-e78e-44e5-976b-dc99964e141c']",An Efficient Temporal Distortion Measure of Videos Based on Spacetime Texture,Pattern Recognition,2017
1184,"Although preoperative Computed tomography images are widely used in intraoperative navigation, they can not provide precise information for organs such as the lungs, which deform severely during surgery because of deflation. By segmenting lung regions using intraoperative endoscopic images, a more accurate navigation can be obtained because endoscopic images directly provide real-time organ descriptions. However, satisfactory segmentation is rarely achieved with the algorithms in the literature due to the high deformability of the lungs and similarity between the background and object. This article addresses these problems by describing a novel approach for lung region segmentation based on endoscopic images. The proposed method leverages both GrabCut and optical flow for continuous segmentation. It also introduces a novel technique for quick user interaction, in which users are required to quickly provide a rough curve that shows the possible area of the boundary, and then a much more precise segmentation is deduced based on the rough curve. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated by comparing it with conventional algorithms. The results show that the average F-measure of the proposed method is more than 97%. The position, size, and boundary of the lungs obtained by the proposed method can provide useful intraoperative navigation for lung resection surgeries.","['Shuqiong Wu', 'Megumi Nakao', 'Tetsuya Matsuda']",a7103c03-45ed-4406-84ce-1431f72e9c57,0,"['0e724681-f855-4351-b17c-c64375243921', '14d9b1a0-ccad-418f-9041-c5852ac01c0c', '20b8fe9c-a430-48f9-827d-a77e2d177653', '2348054d-64ba-4368-8843-516baee03da0', '4f203988-9601-4710-80cf-fb7dcdd27192', '564c9926-0202-4fab-859b-739b6cbff38f', '5ffadf36-4496-4be6-b8a8-828fa37f7757', '678d6e28-9536-48be-a6d4-880c86a69409', '77f81b24-dd73-4b39-9c31-080fc3f78143', '8dc974ee-e366-4175-b583-dba9f3811999', '9a56ad13-6ccb-4644-b154-e2dfd1f4e89b', 'acc4d694-0bc0-42e8-9721-db86c9cf98b7', 'd60a1509-6450-468e-9b2e-f600b1de64c8', 'eaaecdfe-4671-4c23-a334-db237b02d3a5']",Continuous lung region segmentation from endoscopic images for intra-operative navigation,Computers in Biology and Medicine,2017
1185,"This paper addresses the foundations of Teleological Individualism, the view that organisms, even non-sentient organisms, are goal-oriented systems while biological collectives, such as ecosystems or conspecific groups, are mere assemblages of organisms. Typical defenses of Teleological Individualism ground the teleological organization of organisms in the workings of natural selection. This paper shows that grounding teleological organization in natural selection is antithetical to Teleological Individualism because such views assume a view about the units of selection on which it is only individual organisms that are units of selection. However, none of the Conventionalist, Reductionist, or Multi-Level Realist theories serve to justify such an assumption. Thus, Teleological Individualism cannot be grounded in natural selection.",['John Basl'],4bcceec6-e690-4674-aa87-b04a037e8b8b,0,['b0eae4c4-c61c-4e31-8591-9cd1ce7695fe'],A trilemma for teleological individualism,Synthese,2017
1186,"Linear [one-dimensional (1-D)] sparse arrays such as nested arrays and minimum redundancy arrays have hole-free difference coarrays with   $O(N^2)$   virtual sensor elements, where   $N$   is the number of physical sensors. The hole-free property makes it easier to perform beamforming and DOA estimation in the coarray domain which behaves like an uniform linear array. The   $O(N^2)$    property implies that   $O(N^2)$   uncorrelated sources can be identified. For the 2-D case, planar sparse arrays with hole-free coarrays having   $O(N^2)$   elements have also been known for a long time. These include billboard arrays, open box arrays (OBA), and 2-D nested arrays. Their merits are similar to those of the 1-D sparse arrays mentioned above, although identifiability claims regarding    $O(N^2)$   sources have to be handled with more care in 2-D. This paper introduces new planar sparse arrays with hole-free coarrays having    $O(N^2)$   elements just like the OBA, with the additional property that the number of sensor pairs with small spacings such as   $\lambda /2$   decreases, reducing the effect of mutual coupling. The new arrays include half-open box arrays, half-open box arrays with two layers, and hourglass arrays. Among these, simulations show that hourglass arrays have the best estimation performance in presence of mutual coupling.","['Chun-Lin Liu', 'P. P.

Process-based ecosystem models have emerged as important tools for predicting long-term peatland dynamics, but their application is often challenging because they require programming skills. In this paper, we present NUCOMBog, an R package of the NUCOM-Bog model (Heijmans et al. 2008), which simulates the vegetation, carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics of peatlands in monthly time steps. The package complements the model with appropriate functions, such as the calculation of net ecosystem exchange, as well as parallel functionality. As a result, the NUCOMBog R package provides a user-friendly tool for simulating vegetation and biogeochemical cycles/fluxes in peatlands over years/decades, under different management strategies and climate change scenarios, with the option to use all the in-built model analysis capabilities of R, such as plotting, sensitivity analysis or optimization.","['J.W.M.

1189,"Gold immunochromatographic strip (GICS) assay provides a quick, convenient, single-copy and on-site approach to determine the presence or absence of the target analyte when applied to an extensive variety of point-of-care tests. It is always desirable to quantitatively detect the concentration of trace substance in the specimen so as to uncover more useful information compared with the traditional qualitative (or semi-quantitative) strip assay. For this purpose, this paper is concerned with the GICS image denoising and deblurring problems caused by the complicated environment of the intestine/intrinsic restrictions of the strip characteristics and the equipment in terms of image acquisition and transmission. The gradient projection approach is used, together with the total variation minimization approach, to denoise and deblur the GICS images. Experimental results and quantitative evaluation are presented, by means of the peak signal-to-noise ratio, to demonstrate the performance of the combined algorithm. The experimental results show that the gradient projection method provides robust performance for denoising and deblurring the GICS images, and therefore serves as an effective image processing methodology capable of providing more accurate information for the interpretation of the GICS images.","['Nianyin Zeng', 'Hong Zhang', 'Yurong Li', 'Jinling Liang', 'Abdullah M.

Temporal evaluation is an important tool for analyzing the malignant behavior of lesions during treatment, or of indeterminate lesions that may be benign. This work proposes a methodology for the analysis, quantification, and visualization of small (local) and large (global) changes in lung lesions. In addition, we extract textural features for the classification of lesions as benign or malignant.#R##N#Methods#R##N#We employ the statistical concept of uncertainty to associate each voxel of a lesion to a probability that changes occur in the lesion over time. We employ the Jensen divergence and hypothesis test locally to verify voxel-to-voxel changes, and globally to capture changes in lesion volumes.#R##N#Results#R##N#For the local hypothesis test, we determine that the change in density varies by between 3.84 and 40.01% of the lesion volume in a public database of malignant lesions under treatment, and by between 5.76 and 35.43% in a private database of benign lung nodules. From the texture analysis of regions in which the density changes occur, we are able to discriminate lung lesions with an accuracy of 98.41%, which shows that these changes can indicate the true nature of the lesion.#R##N#Conclusion#R##N#In addition to the visual aspects of the density changes occurring in the lesions over time, we quantify these changes and analyze the entire set using volumetry. In the case of malignant lesions, large b-divergence values are associated with major changes in lesion volume. In addition, this occurs when the change in volume is small but is associated with significant changes in density, as indicated by the histogram divergence. For benign lesions, the methodology shows that even in cases where the change in volume is small, a change of density occurs. This proves that even in lesions that appear stable, a change in density occurs.","['Stelmo Magalhães Barros Netto', 'Aristófanes Corrêa Silva', 'Hélio Lopes', 'Anselmo Cardoso de Paiva', 'Rodolfo Acatauassú Nunes', 'Marcelo Gattass']",099bc65b-8721-48bc-955f-a76ea47bdb60,50,"['42c94176-d6f6-4a5b-8722-ee21f456deb6', '438371e0-636f-49bb-a4e4-655b8d61821e', '4dae2d9a-ef5e-41a7-ac0a-7f4ecd74564e', '59a17fca-8748-4f5b-b552-11baaa547d8c', '5b7d71a5-ca46-498d-a4b3-871f36a6f517', '619a43db-0378-49de-8b89-38ba8da65876', '802b5b6b-d98d-4576-aeee-7c67a0a650e4', '8b4b56cb-271c-48f1-bfef-a9c18ab162ec', 'd757f468-a77e-4e9e-96f0-a15ed9b1156a', 'e50cb4d4-3be5-4690-b9b8-1050fabc24e1', 'fcb41378-32f7-4aab-8458-fc5a99d74f92']",Statistical tools for the temporal analysis and classification of lung lesions,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,2017

In order to avoid a swarm of failures in a short time, it is essential to measure the degree of dispersion from different failure times in a group of products to the first failure time. This phenomenon is relevant to the crowding of system conditions near the worst one among a group of products. The group size in this paper represents a finite number of products, instead of infinite number or a single product. We evaluate the reliability of the product fleet from two aspects. First, we define near-extreme system condition and near-extreme failure time for offline solutions, which means no online observations. Second, we apply them to a continuous degradation system that breaks down when it reaches a soft failure threshold. By using particle filtering in the framework of prognostics and health management for a group of products, we aim to estimate near-extreme system condition and further predict the remaining useful life (RUL) using online solutions.

1192,"This paper presents a modeling framework that permits to describe in an integrated manner the structure of the critical system to analyze, by using an enriched fault tree, the dysfunctional behavior of its components, by means of Markov processes, and the reconfiguration strategies that have been planned to ensure safety and availability, with Moore machines. This framework has been developed from BDMP (Boolean logic Driven Markov Processes), a previous framework for dynamic repairable systems. First, the contribution is motivated by pinpointing the limitations of BDMP to model complex reconfiguration strategies and the failures of the control of these strategies.

1193,"The successful launch of the GF-4 satellite has greatly enhanced wide-swath and high-frequency imaging capabilities, both of which are urgently needed in the fields of ship detection and monitoring. In this letter, the applicability of GF-4 satellite data for ship recognition and maritime traffic surveillance was investigated. It is concluded that the movement of ships, the velocity and direction, for instance, can be detected by using either a single GF-4 image that has short time lags between bands, or time-series GF-4 images that have a short interval between their acquisition times, implying that GF-4 satellite images have the potentiality for the monitoring of moving ships.","['Zhixin Zhang', 'Yun Shao', 'Wei Tian', 'Qiufang Wei', 'Yazhou Zhang', 'Qingjun Zhang']",f34fac7e-182c-4978-a734-e9dd76a6b280,0,['50ae11ee-67ae-482f-9fbb-7269909e3cbc'],Application Potential of GF-4 Images for Dynamic Ship Monitoring,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017

In this paper we present an analytical model to investigate the behaviour and performance of the TO-DCF protocol with regards to operating parameters such as the number of nodes, the contention window size and the backoff countdown probabilities. We then compare numerical results from an implementation of our model with simulations. Our model shows a high level of accuracy, even when the model assumptions are relaxed, and provides guidance for network operators to correctly configure the weight functions for nodes running TO-DCF given the network’s operating conditions.","['Emma Fitzgerald', 'Ulf Körner', 'Björn Landfeldt']",0d6b07be-e9d0-4443-9df2-e5f93d07c774,0,"['04e665f0-11b7-483c-9ee7-de2ad00eb3ac', '0eed8058-3ee4-4a64-9c9c-4f0d1c7b96ab', '168dc7a8-093c-486d-b734-bf6fcf85ef66', '1775940c-b07e-48f5-93be-ca7794bb9a25', '379c2ea7-14e3-4323-82ee-f209dfa4004b', '493e4bc5-5745-485e-85b2-80bfd595a739', '5ec5f543-9b2f-47e4-91bf-4262f8a5a21c', '6ed13d45-3965-4a51-bc0c-c7a49f49af56', '8cc9ea80-563f-4e62-bda9-8ff6d71cf6ae', '90c3436f-3826-48a4-bbcd-2b2db520c208', '9a2f35dd-a7cf-4f99-9f49-cf5e97c5b5ed', '9aa1fb0b-af96-48f5-9669-90a473886ae4', 'a7d13553-7283-446c-89a0-5b13f2daa63f', 'afd4c865-5c81-424b-82c3-1dcb6150ea6d', 'b018a0c2-4381-4ee6-a8f2-3175cfc28b12', 'b2d2a210-8641-4020-aafd-091cd928af45', 'bf1f8753-3a92-4ff9-bce8-f881fa02b726', 'cb0cec0a-7619-4a60-a603-f82ce1abe7c9', 'df9da54d-7e74-472d-a5fa-19f5edd8e935', 'e9245e4d-d998-48b0-9fb6-ac1e17dba0b0', 'efdbe9ac-482b-416a-9bec-8632d8d5fc3f', 'f8268df6-8c32-446a-a4f6-d1f83ad79a4d', 'fb3233d3-6a0d-438e-be48-a77cbd145673']",An analytic model for Throughput Optimal Distributed Coordination Function (TO-DCF),Telecommunication Systems,2017

1197,"In many real world optimization problems, including Redundancy Allocation Problem (RAP), there is a need to optimize more than one objective function simultaneously. In this paper, a new multi-objective formulation is presented for the RAP by considering the reliability and cost of the system as the objective functions. The previous formulations have been proposed based on the assumption that all components of a subsystem are homogeneous. This constraint leads to an increase in the designing cost and prevents from reaching to higher quantities of the system reliability. The presented formulation in this research provides an opportunity for the subsystems components to be non-homogeneous in the required conditions. Due to the complexity of the RAPs, a Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) namely, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is developed to identify the Pareto optimal front. The results show that in addition to a high capability in generating the Pareto optimal solutions, the proposed NSGA-II has a high efficiency in increasing the system reliability and reducing the designing costs simultaneously.","['Abdolhamid Eshraghniaye Jahromi', 'Mohammad Feizabadi']",31134904-c510-41c6-8355-72b08b77068e,0,"['14897014-1e2e-4e36-ae25-aae3a0b202da', '1752f76d-1f1c-4817-abdd-1b3774e54158', '24a0425e-c3fe-4f0d-b9d7-db6f7d55dd70', '24e60d74-6019-4362-988e-c78e2e78a84b', '41d99c83-e64f-43fb-a9ca-67bab7d90b2c', '46df7dfe-120b-485a-b291-2527a2cfcf7b', '4c2b69b9-b034-4221-b0be-9144380eb99b', '5865bde3-cca0-45bc-9c3b-0a7d5ac7951c', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '75764117-2900-44b2-a96b-f2feada98a8c', '763c5ce7-5c8e-42dc-b995-f0a96c39fffa', '8403dd09-8a52-41bf-99f8-99ba710961d4', '9b04081e-acc2-4dd7-b6d6-f082526d2507', '9c2a40ba-37d6-4116-b9bc-a0c30a56df12', 'a1d66f24-d102-44ab-8649-d84447d78254', 'a7e5f60d-a8a9-4bf6-978f-b890275a0729', 'bb877487-a56c-477d-9dbd-b73a685f853e', 'cecc7480-855f-4131-87f0-51979eb2d938', 'dc24454f-60f6-4252-8bf8-65f464346009', 'e74a84b9-9eac-4954-b9ec-7565bb849859', 'e7c82f53-5840-44c2-8324-49992644f10a', 'f0b41d0a-ab2f-45b3-9168-bf696c2ea5bd', 'fbe3f687-75ab-4547-ad09-2e57a1202b0c']",Optimization of multi-objective redundancy allocation problem with non-homogeneous components,Computers & Industrial Engineering,2017

The findings of the present study reflect the positive effect of audio-tactile maps on cognitive map creation and, thus, their effect on the spatial knowledge of people with blindness.

1200,"Billions of users are now inter-connected in Online Social Networks (OSNs) and, as they interact with each other, massive amounts of potentially private data are collected at the OSN providers’ (e.g., Facebook or Twitter) premises. Unfortunately, provider-initiated privacy violations on this data are frequent and there is little chance that the providers will grant users effective data-protection means. To address these issues and to help users regain the control over their data, decentralized OSNs (DOSNs) have lately been introduced as a competitive paradigm to provider-controlled, centralized OSNs. DOSNs are built to function without the participation of a provider and with the intent to prevent any misuse of private user data. However, all proposed DOSNs still lack widespread adoption. While challenging the market-leading OSNs is difficult for many reasons, in this paper, we set out to understand the technical deficiencies behind the absence of a successful DOSN. We focus on the major technical challenge of DOSNs: they need to substitute the datacenter-based infrastructure of centralized OSNs. We first review recent advances in decentralizing OSNs based on how they approach that challenge. In a next step, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages each approach yields, and then derive a series of challenges that a successful DOSN will have to fulfill. Finally, we discuss options of moving forward in designing a new DOSN that could be successful in doing so.","['David Koll', 'Jun Li', 'Xiaoming Fu']",6769aeb4-2df3-40eb-936d-6674e0aed479,0,"['16dd809d-7b14-409f-b937-64c5e879e957', '186c0136-8950-4d13-a5c5-9e0077f62fff', '28ed510c-d8e6-480c-b7f3-3ced12805af4', '29aa3b11-e863-4642-beac-f96a8fb0da94', '2a2e9cd3-5caf-41a3-8095-5549e545c92d', '2af4926a-ac7a-4799-8209-fb5cb0b01fab', '2eaa8526-ad52-44e2-a6b4-539f1254d575', '3a1ae747-111b-4415-a700-9f3f14690093', '40d9a6c9-b99e-43cc-90eb-5259cf4416a0', '46461e73-e424-4a75-900e-2d6189ab47fc', '48d1fd6b-a2c0-4427-a353-85adef51fa62', '4960f5c1-5442-4888-99fd-46e4ec8443e4', '4b3881a2-126d-4c87-b4f1-3d48bc82fe88', '5243e1e3-1672-481b-8375-00a42b688a40', '539d8a4a-eda4-48ad-a185-f7cac88d8c52', '59cfca66-2c6c-4099-9d0e-00790b49a792', '644dd638-d004-4103-ba65-605f4ba4231b', '7381c210-9a2f-4480-87bd-8fd02135f7ff', '755c734d-6e65-470d-b9bd-0b4b3422bfe4', '76808865-49da-47c2-a853-8c3f5c542aac', '849a9e8b-aa41-4967-9898-8f9961109071', '8589345a-c6cc-4bab-be14-5fcee67dac21', '8629e247-64e6-411d-9bcb-3acedb8fb89f', '868ba79f-c006-456e-92b1-251445a14743', '915d0b6a-ee11-4bd1-87e4-570c1a3f7b23', '96966992-8aaa-45f1-a62e-93ddd4b02878', '9722bfd4-40e7-47b9-b763-c46714ddda3f', '9f4bcb38-61e0-435e-a4d8-dc4ddfd2e1f4', 'a2b4e930-1be1-4b91-8122-aacb6ec72fab', 'a4a9d7d6-9585-474e-8425-5f6214b8578c', 'aa9872c8-d699-4a0e-b2d5-dc04680af84f', 'b074e2b6-3580-4d05-a75e-2645b4e13b28', 'b0c5b21c-50eb-40c2-b12d-df2f45eeefa4', 'b62a7411-aa85-4464-8449-dfb1893b203b', 'bcef494e-0b1d-4ba6-8c7e-e14bf127de60', 'c490f80c-4dbd-44ce-9db9-10e251633da0', 'c8f856f6-b2f3-4c12-95ee-42e50004a166', 'cd2c8e31-de94-4130-8494-f4f941d59b20', 'e3392486-0836-44b2-b41f-0b46120c96f8', 'e3b3affb-29e9-475c-8820-2b129e2aeda1', 'e46a1a7f-a90d-4d98-ae8e-f0810aa5f980', 'eb02194b-fa72-4f3e-a259-1dd36cd4839d', 'ec6a82f8-a6c3-4ba6-87b6-0c309278b4f2', 'f1309027-d0d9-49f8-a920-e56ce12a744d', 'f14df1ed-e3e9-4348-9040-fc06e3411b95']",The Good Left Undone: Advances and Challenges in Decentralizing Online Social Networks,Computer Communications,2017
1201,"Wave Field Synthesis allows the reconstruction of an arbitrary target sound field within a listening area by using a secondary source contour of spherical monopoles. While phase correct synthesis is ensured over the whole listening area, amplitude deviations are present besides a predefined reference curve. So far, the existence and potential shapes of this reference curve was not extensively discussed in the Wave Field Synthesis literature. This paper introduces improved driving functions for 2.5D Wave Field Synthesis. The novel driving functions allow for the control of the locations of amplitude correct synthesis for arbitrarily shaped—possibly curved—secondary source distributions. This is achieved by deriving an expressive physical interpretation of the stationary phase approximation leading to the presented unified Wave Field Synthesis framework. The improved solutions are better suited for practical applications. Additionally, a consistent classification of existing implicit and explicit 2.5D sound field synthesis solutions as special cases of the unified framework is given.","['Gergely Firtha', 'Peter Fiala', 'Frank Schultz', 'Sascha Spors']",2ac16556-a604-4695-a5dd-de80fc252366,50,"['4e2a5236-aa68-46ec-a2e1-187edee39290', '54a317bb-c194-4725-9740-3edfedef9739']",Improved Referencing Schemes for 2.5D Wave Field Synthesis Driving Functions,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",2017
1202,"High throughput metabolomics makes it possible to measure the relative abundances of numerous metabolites in biological samples, which is useful to many areas of biomedical research. However, missing values (MVs) in metabolomics datasets are common and can arise due to both technical and biological reasons. Typically, such MVs are substituted by a minimum value, which may lead to different results in downstream analyses. Here we present a modified version of the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) approach which accounts for truncation at the minimum value, i.e., KNN truncation (KNN-TN). We compare imputation results based on KNN-TN with results from other KNN approaches such as KNN based on correlation (KNN-CR) and KNN based on Euclidean distance (KNN-EU). Our approach assumes that the data follow a truncated normal distribution with the truncation point at the detection limit (LOD). The effectiveness of each approach was analyzed by the root mean square error (RMSE) measure as well as the metabolite list concordance index (MLCI) for influence on downstream statistical testing. Through extensive simulation studies and application to three real data sets, we show that KNN-TN has lower RMSE values compared to the other two KNN procedures as well as simpler imputation methods based on substituting missing values with the metabolite mean, zero values, or the LOD. MLCI values between KNN-TN and KNN-EU were roughly equivalent, and superior to the other four methods in most cases. Our findings demonstrate that KNN-TN generally has improved performance in imputing the missing values of the different datasets compared to KNN-CR and KNN-EU when there is missingness due to missing at random combined with an LOD. The results shown in this study are in the field of metabolomics but this method could be applicable with any high throughput technology which has missing due to LOD.","['Jasmit Shah', 'Shesh N.

1203,"ABSTRACTA series of online rumours have seriously influenced the normal production and living of people. This paper aims to study the combined impact of psychological factor, propagation delay, network topology and control strategy on rumour diffusion over the online social networks. Based on an online social network, which is seen as a scale-free network, we model the spread of rumours by using a delayed SIS (Susceptible and Infected) epidemic-like model with consideration of psychological factor and network topology. First, through theoretical analysis, we illustrate the boundedness of the density of rumour-susceptible individuals and rumour-infected individuals. Second, we obtain the basic reproduction number R0 and prove the stability of the non-rumour equilibrium point and the rumour-spreading equilibrium point. Third, control strategies, such as uniform immunisation control, proportional immunisation control, targeted immunisation control and optimum control, are put forward to restrain rumour diffu...","['Linhe Zhu', 'Hongyong Zhao']",c2bf902d-0fa4-47d6-9134-1ba827942956,0,"['1be746f4-99e0-4655-9023-fd61ef3e715a', '4a51683a-aad7-4f2a-a78c-c345606ce8c1', 'da8ff0ce-f0c0-45ef-88a0-e599eebff7cb']",Dynamical behaviours and control measures of rumour-spreading model with consideration of network topology,International Journal of Systems Science,2017
1204,"In this work, we investigate the use of domain decomposition techniques in developing novel block-wise PIC detectors for communication systems. Specifically, we consider the cancellation of inter-antenna-interference in the uplink of massive MIMO systems and develop a new block-wise PIC detector based on additive Schwarz method. Up to our knowledge, this is the first time domain decomposition techniques are applied within the wireless communication field. Careful inspection of the channel cross-correlation matrix reveals the fact that the latter has a special structure which supports the use of block iterative methods. We exploit this fact and develop a block-wise PIC detector that is suitable for implementation on parallel processors. Convergence analysis and the impact of various parameters such as the level of overlap and the number of blocks on the convergence behavior of the novel PIC detector are considered. Simulation results show important improvement in convergence speed compared to the conventional linear PIC detector.",['Abdelouahab Bentrcia'],549f4af2-ea12-48c7-885e-daa441b9f9c4,0,"['2db966c3-b2f1-4aff-b4e3-d95534581807', '34d4e37b-e575-4316-847b-d8a661b51473', '4752134e-403e-4497-b91f-0d05ccbcf1b7', '6e41d765-654e-4755-b084-31e0ead46c4f', '745cdce0-a88d-4c21-8975-58332c0794c3', '8ae8295e-d6d4-40f9-b88a-c8da0d5b2a9f', '91f1068b-9feb-4799-b920-67205c36999b', 'cb0b1db8-38f1-4b23-ab4a-ba029aec5d8d', 'cbf43c6f-833a-49d8-9e48-8844fa343e39', 'dbd98283-629d-4fe9-9638-947e35c70955', 'e61d85ca-4cf4-4697-9d13-4975e734f500', 'e9af615e-eb4f-4059-a80c-d1961fa99fa9']",Domain Decomposition Based PIC Detectors for Massive MIMO,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
1205,"Facial expression verification has been extensively exploited due to its wide application in affective computing, robotic vision, man-machine interaction and medical diagnosis. With the recent development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is a need of mobile-targeted facial expression verification, where face scrambling has been proposed for privacy protection during image/video distribution over public network. Consequently, facial expression verification needs to be carried out in a scrambled domain, bringing out new challenges in facial expression recognition. An immediate impact from face scrambling is that conventional semantic facial components become not identifiable, and 3D face models cannot be clearly fitted to a scrambled image. Hence, the classical facial action coding system cannot be applied to facial expression recognition in the scrambled domain. To cope with chaotic signals from face scrambling, this paper proposes an new approach – Many Graph Embedding (MGE) to discover discriminative patterns from the subspaces of chaotic patterns, where the facial expression recognition is carried out as a fuzzy combination from many graph embedding. In our experiments, the proposed MGE was evaluated on three scrambled facial expression datasets: JAFFE, MUG and CK++. The benchmark results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to improve the recognition accuracy, making our method a promising candidate for the scrambled facial expression recognition in the emerging privacy-protected IoT applications.","['Richard M.

1206,"A superpoint is a host that communicates with a large number of distinct destinations (sources) within a measurement period. Identifying superpoints is an important and meaningful task for network security and monitoring. To keep up with the line speed in a high-speed network, fast memory is indispensable for detecting superpoints. Moreover, the memory is also expensive and size-limited. In this letter, we propose a new data streaming algorithm for detecting superpoints, called Snare, which can work in tight memory space and yield good performance. Its accuracy and efficiency come from a new data structure snare and the compensation mechanism for the number of lost flows. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that Snare can detect superpoints accurately and efficiently.","['Lei Zheng', 'Dongrui Liu', 'Weijiang Liu', 'Zhaobin Liu', 'Zhiyang Li', 'Tiantian Wu']",0b1d4430-8eb0-4fb7-bc12-853ffb850cb1,0,"['3555adea-61d8-4d14-ae76-5a9a72a8561a', '4f4b71e9-850a-4a20-8441-bcea6a74dadc', '56f83dd7-cbfc-4448-8f63-697cfa0ae023', '5b073b87-d506-4310-89c6-f9125db94b71', '8ea16fe4-103c-4422-a5d6-4f1ed4ab5670', 'e0da085c-66c0-4b7e-89f8-7e6df57a933a', 'f0a291c1-de81-4403-bdf9-01549f48f98d', 'f2a8d6d8-9d16-47ce-b09a-7e17ea7b12c9']",A Data Streaming Algorithm for Detection of Superpoints With Small Memory Consumption,IEEE Communications Letters,2017
1207,"In this paper, we propose a new fragile watermarking scheme with high-quality recovery capability based on overlapping embedding strategy. The block-wise mechanism for tampering localization and the pixel-wise mechanism for content recovery are collaborated in the proposed scheme. With the assist of interleaving operation, reference bits are derived from mean value of each overlapping block, and then are dispersedly embedded into 1 LSB or 2 LSB layers of the image, corresponding to horizontal-vertical mode and diagonal mode, respectively. Authentication bits are hidden into adaptive LSB layers of the central pixel for each block according to block complexity. On the receiver side, after locating tampered blocks and reconstructing mean-value bits, according to the types of tampered pixels in each overlapping block, three pixel-wise manners are exploited for tampering recovery based on different neighboring blocks. Even if the tampered area is extensive, the proposed scheme can achieve better quality of recovered image compared with some of state-of-the-art schemes.","['Chuan Qin', 'Ping Ji', 'Xinpeng Zhang', 'Jing Dong', 'Jinwei Wang']",d3943d65-ba06-4e98-9f61-8fe86ebfa898,0,"['047c0975-707b-406f-bc83-2e4d296253e5', '12a6ef9e-7b3c-4d32-99cf-be909c47c4d6', '1a7c8bea-da3b-4664-bbc5-ca5486008b8b', '241da332-ad5b-4a39-8290-9f453ba23051', '37e71e6d-b562-4c56-b278-0a02f911bd45', '44abaf8c-8f3d-43ef-86fa-a45f4ddbb4bf', '4b898e62-f5a5-46fc-8835-9cfdd1876f93', '5666f4f8-6c65-4690-ac06-e14bfeabadc6', '59ac97c2-5c99-4ab2-9321-50e99e9bcedb', '6c99adef-111c-4a13-a7ed-a81f703f0c41', '6df5b063-272e-470d-a95c-8b300385c0dd', '6e288cbe-c599-4756-9fcc-94bbf9eff406', '703e3612-08d8-4894-a335-740197421981', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '8f50a6e8-020a-4939-9c04-4e658ea7994b', '97df29a4-cfb5-45b0-97ba-02646fc89d09', '9d699d20-5dbb-405a-90f0-38a7463e50e6', 'ac8a5460-9496-4920-a95b-a29b8f5f0641', 'ad601075-db55-4121-ba49-329fbb67d1ef', 'bb44c531-5bc3-4e3e-82dc-af92d58a0dc9', 'bcf9a356-9660-45fe-9fc3-941348962d7a', 'd09db99c-7a5f-4af9-a1f7-7214d0370c12', 'effefeb5-5fde-4c61-9c9c-91ef45fa14e7', 'f12f7bee-6d05-480e-a459-6e9298addee8', 'fa61194d-ddc4-4e9c-8d1d-dfbed40a24d2']",Fragile image watermarking with pixel-wise recovery based on overlapping embedding strategy,Signal Processing,2017
1208,"In this paper we investigate the intrinsic design constraints and performance limits of networked control systems. We propose new information measures and correspondingly, develop an information-theoretic paradigm for analyzing the performance trade-offs and limits in disturbance attenuation over information-constrained networked feedback, which is enabled by a cohesive development of new information measures, Bode-type integral inequalities, and performance bounds. The integrals and bounds incorporate the information measures and serve to quantify the trade-offs and limits in disturbance attenuation for broad classes of networked feedback systems consisting of linear time-invariant plants and causal, possibly nonlinear, time-varying stabilizing controllers communicating over general noisy channels with causal encoders and decoders. The notion of negentropy rate is introduced to address general, non-Gaussian disturbances. The channel blurredness, a newly proposed information measure for the quality of communication channels, is used to characterize the effect of communication channel noises on the integrals and henceforth the trade-offs in disturbance attenuation. Bounds on the power gain, a novel disturbance attenuation measure tailored for performance analysis of networked control systems, provide the fundamental limits of disturbance attenuation achievable by networked feedback.","['Song Fang', 'Jie Chen', 'Hideaki Ishii']",dc4f0809-7dbf-46cb-b52a-5ea9bee73ec4,0,"['00f45c8c-cdab-4f4e-b506-9e2150c67283', '05eb2733-3fed-4baa-99ca-af70772ef95b', '41eb2bc9-f000-427c-9c26-f937abf69b83', '570924cf-c572-46c1-9d66-21f9c230adae', '59f46f53-6c41-4942-909c-83c058f04077', '5da29eee-8cfd-4916-8b9e-01f58f218f9e', '6739782c-f8b3-42cd-b471-8ac029543668', '9292c3a9-8b2d-49af-87b3-3d6a0338c6bd', 'a00245c7-76da-4f2f-8da0-2036fc9a0098', 'a24149eb-52db-4c99-adea-66f613bf4494', 'ac2e8959-4c7b-4787-931a-34dfa0196b94', 'ae4df9f4-6ef1-47ca-a66f-1d5092e7f9f0', 'af17e8df-90d9-4f07-9158-3a5ec64d1a1e', 'b35aeeb4-2be7-4cff-81b6-fb6c7df5ce8d', 'bc96cd12-a493-449d-aa8f-0627393c7cb3', 'c082bc88-4a9a-48b3-af1b-841af5bfccbd', 'ca52b934-af8a-4202-b59a-036547bc7425', 'ccd743f1-bf55-4744-863c-1febce0dfa9a', 'ce467914-71bf-4beb-8064-4527b982a62f', 'e9ae56f3-87cb-44ae-ab8b-dbd655b393b1', 'efe10f5e-c66d-4311-8072-5c3b338704f5', 'f16a7763-3eb0-4147-86a1-fa21cc790452']",Design constraints and limits of networked feedback in disturbance attenuation: An information-theoretic analysis ☆,Automatica,2017
1209,"Finding maximum weight connected subgraphs within networks is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem both from theoretical and practical standpoints. One of the most prominent applications of this problem appears in Systems Biology and it corresponds to the detection of active subnetworks within gene interaction networks.#R##N##R##N#Due to its importance, several modeling and algorithmic strategies have been proposed for tackling the maximum weight connected subgraph problem (MWCS) over the last years; the most effective strategies typically depend on the use of integer linear programming (ILP). Nonetheless, this implies that large-scale networks (such as those appearing in Systems Biology) can become burdensome; moreover, not all practitioners may have access to an ILP solver. In this paper, a unified modeling and algorithmic scheme is designed to solve the MWCS and some of its application-oriented variants with cardinality-constraints or budget-constraints. The proposed framework is based on a general node-based model which is tackled by a Relax-and-Cut scheme, i.e., Lagrangian relaxation combined with constraint generation; this yields a heuristic procedure capable of providing both dual and primal bounds. The approach is enhanced by additional valid inequalities, lifted valid inequalities, primal heuristics and variable-fixing procedures.#R##N##R##N#Computational results on instances from the literature, as well as on additional large-scale instances, show that the proposed framework is competitive with respect to the existing approaches and it allows to find improved solutions for some unsolved instances from literature. The effect of initializing a Branch-and-Cut approach with information from the Relax-and-Cut is also investigated.

1211,"Task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely employed for brain activation detection and brain network analysis. Modeling rich information from spatially-organized collection of fMRI time series is challenging because of the intrinsic complexity. Hypothesis-driven methods, such as the general linear model (GLM), which regress exterior stimulus from voxel-wise functional brain activity, are limited due to overlooking the complexity of brain activities and the diversity of concurrent brain networks. Recently, sparse representation and dictionary learning methods have attracted increasing interests in task fMRI data analysis. The major advantage of this methodology is its promise in reconstructing concurrent brain networks systematically. However, this data-driven strategy is, to some extent, arbitrary and does not sufficiently utilize the prior information of task design and neuroscience knowledge. To bridge this gap, we here propose a novel supervised sparse representation and dictionary learning framework based on stochastic coordinate coding (SCC) algorithm for task fMRI data analysis, in which certain brain networks are learned with known information such as pre-defined temporal patterns and spatial network patterns, and at the same time other networks are learned automatically from data. Our proposed method has been applied to two independent task fMRI datasets, and qualitative and quantitative evaluations have shown that our method provides a new and effective framework for task fMRI data analysis.","['Jinglei Lv', 'Binbin Lin', 'Qingyang Li', 'Wei Zhang', 'Yu Zhao', 'Xi Jiang', 'Lei Guo', 'Junwei Han', 'Xintao Hu', 'Christine C.

1212,"Allometric scaling can reflect underlying mechanisms, dynamics and structures in complex systems; examples include typical scaling laws in biology, ecology and urban development. In this work, we study allometric scaling in scientific fields. By performing an analysis of the outputs/inputs of various scientific fields, including the numbers of publications, citations, and references, with respect to the number of authors, we find that in all fields that we have studied thus far, including physics, mathematics and economics, there are allometric scaling laws relating the outputs/inputs and the sizes of scientific fields. Furthermore, the exponents of the scaling relations have remained quite stable over the years. We also find that the deviations of individual subfields from the overall scaling laws are good indicators for ranking subfields independently of their sizes.","['Hong-Guang Dong', 'Menghui Li', 'Ru Liu', 'Chensheng Wu', 'Jinshan Wu']",5d0011d0-ba70-4a53-8a6e-3e8f15ed6628,50,"['00a81bf3-d127-4f99-b2ad-e30ed525df36', '14951e23-e2d7-4f03-9f7d-1e2da8f78220', '2243dfc5-3de3-4281-b6b3-4625374a267e', '2a600eb3-94e0-4c61-82f3-9f2d997059dd', '331cc8d9-347d-4398-992c-41bd55e798ef', '46d6eece-0327-44a6-8862-7fa4ba5dad1a', '6bc94203-0728-4cd4-8a97-340196bd8df5', '73f0a901-c5c9-4da9-88e3-96cbdbe1a84f', '9e805495-6ad2-49a4-a0fc-0c4d649173b3', 'b61efa6e-7ae5-49b1-a223-937a8b0357a5', 'b7ab494e-3707-4249-915f-bd3215d43014']",Allometric scaling in scientific fields,Scientometrics,2017

1214,"Economic research on innovation has long discussed which policy instruments best foster innovativeness in individuals and organizations. One of the instruments easily accessible to policy-makers is innovation contests; however, there is ambiguous empirical evidence concerning how such contests should be designed. Our experimental study provides evidence by analyzing the effects of two different innovation contests on subjects’ innovativeness: a prize for the cumulative innovativeness and a prize for the best innovation. We implement a creative real effort task simulating a sequential innovation process, whereby subjects determine royalty fees for their created products, which also serve as a measure of cooperation. We find that both contest conditions reduce the willingness to cooperate between subjects compared to a benchmark condition without an innovation contest. While both contests have similar effects, the most sophisticated innovation is significantly more valuable when there is a prize for the best innovation. However, the total innovation activity is not influenced by introducing innovation contest schemes. From a policy perspective, the implementation of state-subsidized innovation contests in addition to the existing intellectual property rights system should be questioned.","['Julia Brüggemann', 'Lukas Meub']",c1edacaf-3963-4972-bf9c-c66f25b21634,0,"['096139a0-1d6b-4b4d-a52d-b2cf3ec2dcf5', '8f3bff77-653d-4531-a15b-36499ed82f0f', 'f19eccc5-8652-4715-af1e-f5fbc173399f', 'f6f6b459-5b2b-45a4-8057-b07320972ebc']",Experimental evidence on the effects of innovation contests,Information Economics and Policy,2017

In this paper, we present a comparative study on the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques to early predict students likely to fail in introductory programming courses. Although several works have analyzed these techniques to identify students' academic failures, our study differs from existing ones as follows: (i) we investigate the effectiveness of such techniques to identify students likely to fail at early enough stage for action to be taken to reduce the failure rate; (ii) we analyse the impact of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks, on the effectiveness of the mentioned techniques. In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of four prediction techniques on two different and independent data sources on introductory programming courses available from a Brazilian Public University: one comes from distance education and the other from on-campus. The results showed that the techniques analyzed in our study are able to early identify students likely to fail, the effectiveness of some of these techniques is improved after applying the data preprocessing and/or algorithms fine-tuning, and the support vector machine technique outperforms the other ones in a statistically significant way.","['Evandro Costa', 'Baldoino Fonseca', 'Marcelo A.

1216,"An orphan disease is any disease that affects a small percentage of the population. Orphan diseases are a great burden to patients and society, and most of them are genetic in origin. Unfortunately, our current understanding of the genes responsible for inherited orphan diseases is still quite limited. Developing effective computational algorithms to discover disease-causing genes would help unveil disease mechanisms and may enable better diagnosis and treatment. We have developed a novel method, named as DIGNiFI (Disease causIng GeNe FInder), which uses Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network-based features to discover and rank candidate disease-causing genes. Specifically, our approach computes topologically similar genes by taking into account both local and global connected paths in PPI networks via Direct Neighbors and Local Random Walks, respectively. Furthermore, since genes with similar phenotypes tend to be functionally related, we have integrated PPI data with gene ontology (GO) annotations and protein complex data to further improve the performance of this approach. Results of 128 orphan diseases with 1184 known disease genes collected from the Orphanet show that our proposed methods outperform existing state-of-the-art methods for discovering candidate disease-causing genes. We also show that further performance improvement can be achieved when enriching the human-curated PPI network data with text-mined interactions from the biomedical literature. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying our method to identifying novel candidate genes for a set of four inherited retinal dystrophies. In this study, we found the top predictions for these retinal dystrophies consistent with literature reports and online databases of other retinal dystrophies. Our method successfully prioritizes orphan-disease-causative genes. This method has great potential to benefit the field of orphan disease research, where resources are scarce and greatly needed.","['Xiaoxia Liu', 'Zhihao Yang', 'Hongfei Lin', 'Michael Simmons', 'Zhiyong Lu']",20289786-8711-4aa9-ab6b-d9f20b7d39a2,50,"['0057d416-7b31-47a5-bc49-c1c84a0da44c', '006bc093-ed6b-49bf-bca9-8d65b79a7b1e', '02f6d645-4beb-4f64-8824-f84aa0ef4693', '031ee1f7-92be-41e4-8139-8566b48cd2d2', '1efebaa0-56eb-4b56-8d14-921f52fdbcec', '294ba6cb-255c-4581-b7ad-d1bd9009ee36', '4cba65da-5693-422a-8f05-0571279cefbf', '5b036000-9c72-489a-adcc-d1a49d628d03', '5d66c83d-6500-4fad-a78f-9745cb6becea', '80574a2b-cae9-4583-a64b-d0f9c3bd0e6d', '90a29882-e3c3-4aab-9d9f-d68a501467e6', '94c6e5e7-1165-45fc-96bb-cdfee15509b8', 'aa6da4d8-064d-4818-b9fc-c7a2cc9acc67', 'b1bde621-17dc-4511-9878-9efa329a7ee4', 'ba1d5e7c-5d6d-4d56-92d6-0f3146130155', 'bb877c6a-f4b8-433c-91fc-53883a96296d', 'bd95b0c4-afdf-4079-acda-6a35bb920d8c', 'c7b0bc9c-55b2-4359-ae4e-60242ab0a8df', 'd62a700f-44c9-4161-a841-cde5e17e20f4']",DIGNiFI: Discovering causative genes for orphan diseases using protein-protein interaction networks,BMC Systems Biology,2017
1217,"Provenance, a metadata component referring to the origin and the processes undertaken to obtain a specific geographic digital feature or product, is crucial to evaluate the quality of spatial information and help in reproducing and replicating geospatial processes. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the geospatial processes, which can potentially modify part or the complete content of datasets, make evident the necessity for describing geospatial provenance at dataset, feature and attribute levels. This paper presents the application of W3C PROV, which is a generic specification to express provenance records, for representing geospatial data provenance at these different levels. In particular, W3C PROV is applied to feature models, where geospatial phenomena are represented as individual features described with spatial (point, lines, polygons, etc.) and non-spatial (names, measures, etc.) attributes.#R##N##R##N#This paper first analyses the potential for representing geospatial provenance in a distributed environment at the three levels of granularity using ISO 19115 and W3C PROV models. Next, an approach for applying the generic W3C PROV provenance model to the geospatial environment is presented. As a proof of concept, we provide an application of W3C PROV to describe geospatial provenance at the feature and attribute levels. The use case presented consists of a conflation of the U.S. Geological Survey dataset with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency dataset. Finally, an example of how to capture the provenance resulting from workflows and chain executions with PROV is also presented. The application uses a web processing service, which enables geospatial processing in a distributed system and allows to capture the provenance information based on the W3C PROV ontology at the feature and attribute levels.","['Guillem Closa', 'Joan Masó', 'Benjamin Proß', 'Xavier Pons']",e3dd91e6-285c-4ecf-aacc-0fdac69e84de,50,"['05ccb38b-7337-4f6d-92ee-209739c93abd', '097f52e1-af2c-4669-8106-acbc53c070e8', '1b5d4c48-57ed-40d0-aeee-a3028861ef7a', '1de635b1-81e1-49a2-addd-4935c77e9ef2', '2538318b-767b-4040-803e-29d416d58146', '2608f42e-69f7-4edc-aa9f-beeffa8ee1f8', '2c52c4b0-2020-41b7-b299-7baf02c3468f', '37ee06b8-1a2c-4ed8-90bc-d097767c257c', '3bc3b806-e51f-4110-818a-8fb9ea196b44', '55e6a15b-549a-42dc-8d28-df16d2073156', '64316b39-e0c7-493d-8d84-b93cc5cb291c', '6e0fe347-9adb-435c-b3f6-18b6812796c3', '8ae88a89-46a8-49a7-a4d9-54993a1b82ed', 'ae640407-7647-4128-90eb-482a486d2c4f', 'bd773e60-ce1f-46d9-88ab-aa50cb31c7d5', 'd53bfa50-c0e0-47ac-8058-db7c384c2c99', 'd59bcff0-c1a8-4f0b-a317-a4e90648aa10', 'd6c69509-b3dc-4d81-85e7-99500bf50dce', 'f6213d16-92ab-493c-b674-279c827bf34c']","W3C PROV to describe provenance at the dataset, feature and attribute levels in a distributed environment","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",2017

Functions that are smooth in certain subdomains will have good approximations in those subdomains, and these sub-approximations can possibly be calculated efficiently in parallel, as long as the subdomains do not overlap. This paper proposes an algorithm that first calculates sub-approximations on non-overlapping subdomains, then extends the subdomains as much as possible and finally produces a global solution on the given domain by letting the subdomains fill the whole domain. Consequently, there will be no Gibbs phenomenon along the boundaries of the subdomains. The method detects faults and gradient faults with good accuracy.

1220,"Linguistic multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems have received many attentions in theoretical and practical aspects. It is well known that center of the linguistic MADM is the aggregation of fuzzy linguistic information. As one widely used type of aggregation operators, the importance weighted aggregation assumes that all the attributes are at the same priority level. This paper deals with linguistic MADM with multiple priorities in terms of strict priority hierarchy or weak priority hierarchy. To do so, based on the 2-tuple linguistic model and the revised product t-norm, a prioritized linguistic idempotent scoring (PLIS) operator is first proposed for linguistic MADM with a strict priority hierarchy to guarantee the idempotent property of prioritized aggregation. Moreover, as an extension of the PLIS operator, a PLIS ordered weighted averaging (PLIS-OWA) operator is proposed to solve linguistic MADM with a weak priority hierarchy. In addition, in practice decision-makers (DMs) are often unsure of their evaluations due to time pressure, lack of experience and data, and therefore may provide uncertain linguistic assessments.

In this work, we rigorously determine the leading term of the Heisenberg-like and entropy-like uncertainty measures of this system as given by the radial expectation values and the Renyi entropies, respectively, at the limit of large D. The associated multidimensional position-momentum uncertainty relations are discussed, showing that they saturate the corresponding general ones. A conjecture about the Shannon-like uncertainty relation is given, and an interesting phenomenon is observed: the Heisenberg-like and Renyi-entropy-based equality-type uncertainty relations for all of the D-dimensional harmonic oscillator states in the pseudoclassical (    D → ∞    ) limit are the same as the corresponding ones for the hydrogenic systems, despite the so different character of the oscillator and Coulomb potentials.","['D.

1224,"Most hovering aircraft such as helicopters and animal-inspired flapping-wing flyers are dynamically unstable in flight, quickly tumbling in the absence of feedback control. The addition of feedback loops can stabilize, but at the cost of additional sensing and actuation components. This can add expense, weight, and complexity. An alternative to feedback is the use of passive mechanisms such as aerodynamic drag to stabilize attitude. Previous work has suggested that small aircraft can be stabilized by adding air dampers above and below the center of mass. We present flight tests of an insect-scale robot operating under this principle. When controlled to a constant altitude, it remains stably upright while undergoing cyclic attitude oscillations. To characterize these oscillations, we present a nonlinear analytic model derived from first principles that reproduces the observed behavior. Using numerical simulation, we analyze how changing damper size, position, mass, and midpoint offset affect these oscillations, building on previous work that considered only a single configuration. Our results indicate that only by increasing damper size can lateral oscillation amplitude be significantly reduced, at the cost of increased damper mass. Additionally, we show that as scale diminishes, the damper size must get relatively larger. This suggests that smaller damper-equipped robots must operate in low-wind areas or in boundary-layer flow near surfaces.","['Sawyer B. Fuller', 'Zhi Ern Teoh', 'Pakpong Chirarattananon', 'Néstor O.

1225,"Robotic assistance for people affected by motor deficits is a fast growing field. In this context, two major challenges remain in terms of automated scene analysis and automated object prehension. More specifically, the most robust of current segmentation methods are still computationally intensive, preventing the automation of objects prehension from being fast enough to be considered acceptable as an everyday technical-aid. The objective of this study is to develop a fast scene analysis using vision and artificial intelligence for object prehension by an assistive robot.#R##N##R##N#The solution developed in this paper aims at facilitating human-machine interaction by enabling users to easily communicate their needs to the technical aid. To achieve this, this paper proposes several novelties in three interconnected domains: scene segmentation, prehension and recognition of 3D objects. A novel technic, inspired by mechanical probing, is developed for scenes probing to detect objects. A simple, fast and effective decision tree is proposed for object prehension. Finally, the physical characteristics of the 3D objects are directly used in the neural network without using discriminants features descriptors.#R##N##R##N#The results obtained in this paper have shown that scene analysis for robotic object prehension in cooperation with a user can be performed with effective promptness. Indeed, the system requires on average 0.6 s to analyze an object in a scene. With the JACO robotic assistance arm, the system can pick up a requested object in 15 s while moving at 50 mm/s, which may be greatly improved upon using a faster robot. The system performance averages 83% accuracy for object recognition and is able to use a decision tree to select a simple approach path for the robot end-effector towards a desired object. This system, in combination with an assistive robot, has great potential for providing users suffering from musculoskeletal disorders with improved autonomy and independence, and for encouraging sustained usage of this type of technical aids.","['C.

This means that, with a systematic way to more efficiently generating Boolean logical patterns, LAD can be used for more effective analysis of data in practice.

Once the insecurity information is detected, the node based on estimated algorithm can control the corresponding implementation of the device, transmit the measuring and control information and images to the handheld terminal at the same time, and give an alarm in order to minimize the laboratory personnel life-threatening and equipment loss. The experimental results show that the developed wireless security monitoring system in this paper can detect the insecurity information of the chemistry and chemical laboratories on-line so that the supervisors can monitor the safety status of the laboratories in time and can take effective protection measures. They can promptly notify the laboratory staff to evacuate quickly, to maximize the protection of laboratory staff safety in emergency.

This observation has immediate implications for quantum thermodynamics, which we discuss. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under reasonable restrictions, the free energy is singled out as a measure of athermality. In particular, we consider an extended class of Gibbs-preserving maps as free operations in a resource-theoretic framework, in which a catalyst is allowed to build up correlations with the system at hand.

We believe that the results of this study can be useful in tackling the problems associated with the implementation of SPI, which is vital to the success and progression of GSD organizations.","['Arif Ali Khan', 'Jacky Keung', 'Mahmood Niazi', 'Shahid Hussain', 'Awais Ahmad']",11924781-ab97-48f5-88e9-f0e07d4bcfa7,0,"['1568ecfd-8bff-40d6-85ce-76276f25904a', '15af3380-ddd1-496a-9c81-5737190a96c9', '2045589f-e0d6-499a-8047-9d5d27bc61b1', '25ee1fe9-2bb6-4b96-aeec-09fd60aaf710', '2c9b2bb9-816a-4499-8aba-60a9513615db', '36810b0c-169a-4377-8bdf-b401287e41fe', '395200d7-11bb-4ca4-8860-712153c621e0', '41af1270-f837-43dd-9046-4192e3688cc6', '45b99265-3a6b-4f32-92f6-f97fc2295e80', '47bb9002-3949-43db-9139-6a0ef5e8717a', '54d1c433-8229-4d9f-ad99-89b4ce3000fd', '5c5e1fa1-3a1b-4e46-9fd1-6118bff87b5a', '6caf2b7c-a9b7-4c28-9e6c-6b504c5dfe79', '6d73df21-a601-4991-a2bb-2b89899de065', '7239998b-777d-4ab5-9fe0-c8adf56c241a', '8375740c-265f-46cc-a91e-0f573247487e', '8bfb4b86-b596-4565-ada1-e8ce92a04599', '8c5b61ca-3988-42f6-bbc6-f1f001657791', '8cef1610-69d1-4b27-9a91-fe2cec85a557', '9c17d1bd-581d-4403-93b7-ce7c1feb641b', 'a88f7228-5826-4a86-a895-f7b616638abf', 'ae54bb27-920d-4f43-8c9f-596bb2c6353e', 'b0e515cb-8bf9-4b61-b1db-b2bccae7b248', 'b4d12116-dbcd-45f5-b0ca-a7d32d3ac857', 'c8336fff-be40-4dc2-a9f8-9e97474db4a1', 'c8d6013e-1ba6-47f0-b405-9e4eed7353b0', 'ce0d71ce-1d85-4977-9e4d-ce2bb6ee2f4c', 'd0106156-5ecd-47d2-a2e4-9af046a27ef1', 'de380f81-5899-4184-a560-06966e35148d', 'f479d42f-18c3-4040-b3eb-c52f55904311', 'fc7bd169-6752-43b7-b485-385cfd6e23c8']",Systematic literature review and empirical investigation of barriers to process improvement in global software development: Client–vendor perspective,Information & Software Technology,2017
1231,"A systematic conformational search was carried out for monomers and homohexamers of furanoid β-amino acids: cis-(S,R) and trans-(S,S) stereoisomers of aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid (ACPC), two different aminofuranuronic acids (AFUα and AFUβ), their isopropylidene derivatives (AFU(ip)), and the key intermediate β-aminotetrahydrofurancarboxylic acid (ATFC). The stereochemistry of the building blocks was chosen to match that of the natural sugar amino acid (xylose and ribose) precursors (XylAFU and RibAFU). The results show that hexamers of cis-furanoid β-amino acids show great variability: while hydrophobic cyclopentane (cis-ACPC)6 and hydrophilic (XylAFUα/β)6 foldamers favor two different zigzagged conformation as hexamers, the backbone fold turns into a helix in the case of (cis-ATFC)6 (10-helix) and (XylAFU(ip))6 (14-helix). Trans stereochemistry resulted in hexamers exclusively with the right-handed helix conformation, (H12P)6, regardless of their polarity. We found that the preferred oligomeric str...","['Dóra K.

1232,"Background and Objective#R##N#Severe trauma patients are those who have several injuries implying a death risk. Prediction systems consider the severity of these injuries to predict whether the patients are likely to survive or not. These systems allow one to objectively compare the quality of the emergency services of trauma centres across different hospitals. However, even the most accurate existing prediction systems are based on the usage of a single model. The aim of this paper is to combine several models to make the prediction, since this methodology usually improves the performance of single models.#R##N#Materials and Methods#R##N#The two currently used prediction systems by the Hospital of Navarre, which are based on logistic regression models, besides the C4.5 decision tree are combined to conform our proposed multiple classifier system. The quality of the method is tested using the major trauma registry of Navarre, which stores information of 462 trauma patients. A 10x10-fold cross-validation model is applied using as performance measures the specificity, sensitivity and the geometric mean between the two former ones. The results are supported by the usage of the Mann–Whitney’s U statistical test.#R##N#Results#R##N#The proposed method provides 0.8908, 0.6703 and 0.7661 for sensitivity, specificity and geometric mean, respectively. It slightly decreases the sensitivity of the currently used systems but it notably increases the specificity, which implies a large enhancement on the geometric mean. The same behaviour is found when it is compared versus four classical ensemble approaches and the random forest. The statistical analysis supports the quality of our proposal, since the obtained p-values are less than 0.01 in all the cases.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#The obtained results show that the multiple classifier systems is the best choice among the considered methods to obtain a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.","['José Antonio Sanz', 'Daniel Paternain', 'Mikel Galar', 'Javier Fernandez', 'Diego Reyero', 'T.

Considering the privacy of the patients, medical data, secure and authenticated access to the medical data located at the medical severs are required. Recently, numerous states of the art authentication schemes are proposed in the literature to increase security of the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS). This paper presents a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of these authentication schemes and classifies them based on the authentication methods applied in each scheme. In addition, a complete list of security attacks which can be conducted against the authentication schemes in the TMIS is provided, and the security capabilities of each scheme and their vulnerability to these attacks are discussed. Furthermore, the proposed authentication schemes are compared, and their advantages, properties and limitations are highlighted. Finally, the concluding remarks and open research issues in TMIS authentication schemes are provided.","['Mohammad Masdari', 'Safiyyeh Ahmadzadeh']",a13db082-c27f-43d8-ab19-49ab5ad845f4,0,"['00e6a6d8-80a2-4cb7-8798-a716b9cc801a', '06531a2f-c3f0-4fb0-981c-e337a0ca4f8d', '070eadfc-d9ae-4b32-8044-082d5cda40cd', '11f43fb3-62c7-4241-9332-b03f8dfae19c', '15411153-0046-489a-8d91-d575ca91dc99', '154b1e2b-8b35-4cae-929e-7df99c439d13', '1efce463-9af6-406b-8b02-f15665129a28', '229a99e2-d340-46c5-b39b-59547ad11c9c', '24b58064-86cf-4f06-b8e8-ee9f45a7465d', '28052235-a4dd-41d1-ad5f-4911aa4b31dd', '4029ab30-5c2c-44ba-8b38-a39ac11cab5c', '43862239-4926-42c7-8908-98c81b3e021e', '4ef62df0-5769-4e60-85a7-7c7e35a70151', '59055386-d647-4e8f-ad2f-f1a1d34f071f', '5b83448e-a3c1-4ab1-be4e-67dda1bf425b', '5efc1a09-94e5-44af-a805-41b4f996448b', '634ad51a-a11b-4d90-8d14-9e6beadde369', '6e7a2d23-e13f-4147-b3ff-45d0ef9121d3', '7049ffeb-ab63-42ca-9ecc-96d89367a2ae', '7716ef9c-47e8-4785-9e64-7351b66d1d68', '790b707b-fcd3-4ffb-8bbb-ad971bb9f896', '7e5e09a2-c9fb-4f5f-994a-a34cb17720b0', '7ead8c1a-5b98-4a28-8d8e-ff64d68a93df', '8001946e-4ead-4dbc-8a59-e58267f242c9', '8a741da6-8d82-4975-9f4a-823c77844d2d', '93d108f7-bd33-44ba-99fe-969bdd5cc842', '986e0790-040a-4246-9c4f-4ac92b5a2316', 'a0a7b959-a1c5-4ce6-880b-0d50818278a8', 'a19fb48b-26f6-43a6-b2bf-df4c6097e98b', 'a923440a-98b0-483b-a878-daef54b32ece', 'ac761884-1e23-4f7f-a5d7-11daa7412e69', 'af22c927-9f39-4b0f-9936-5bb4283a82a5', 'af64a9a6-31cb-4188-84c0-71ca95ca9e49', 'b42d268e-1975-4aff-8df7-23cc5b7f244a', 'bade3aee-b18d-4a77-8595-1496c86276b4', 'bc080f16-fd21-4b7f-a4a1-a1f65dcd7cf6', 'bea545e6-4ddc-4d73-8201-3a96f37e9e5b', 'c11e0811-23d3-4a9d-b6ea-f4b994316106', 'c267e054-4337-4925-a12c-0a0402b5db2f', 'c2e36a74-317a-42e0-abdd-ba9c0f39c7e1', 'c446f159-ff53-4b6c-bd6e-c79957971274', 'c62944a7-c660-429b-a221-e23abf7ae360', 'c67ce502-9ca1-46fb-84e2-e18cb61417b3', 'ccf4f81d-a44d-462f-a9c4-5c7312fb8d63', 'cd7cf186-569e-4005-ac59-b2c0318be1d6', 'd814a1d6-184d-4cf3-918d-fb0c207febc5', 'd83ab44e-1cdd-4ee0-849a-df2d70379d8a', 'db948c14-5316-4af7-89ea-a9f6b1206f43', 'e206392e-f4c2-4a76-81b6-e5e72e9f9f51', 'e48259ea-d4c9-41d0-a3b9-28843b0b72ef', 'e52eb689-7ac4-4b21-878f-df41db33c37b', 'f2a9c760-7a4d-4e26-ac28-612f4da65d6b', 'f4b75cce-8d67-433a-bfcb-0e2cd26644ed', 'f5502888-83c2-4188-bcc3-0b8395633db0', 'ff1b46f8-dbe3-4057-a694-803e7bbca535', 'fff0eb6e-5170-41a2-be3e-44d7f04b2548']",A survey and taxonomy of the authentication schemes in Telecare Medicine Information Systems,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017

In Study 1, we tested FAIQ psychometric properties using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). In Study 2, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to verify the FAIQ factorial structure identified through EFA. Results from CFA confirm the presence of a four-factor model accounting for 58 percent of total variance, plus a general higher order factor that best fits the data. Further relationships between FAIQ factor scores, personality, and Facebook usage have been explored.","['Barbara Caci', 'Maurizio Cardaci', 'Fabrizio Scrima', 'Marco Elio Tabacchi']",916e4611-6007-4654-973f-c3e418758f6d,50,"['592dcc2f-2472-45da-8506-7263b1db183e', '635e2f5c-70c4-422b-b17a-0209dae0242f', '65604e01-8e21-4022-957a-ef1e3fd0d08f', '667dc751-de3d-46c4-be9e-838156fd6e5c', '6bf61f97-b92d-4fba-a7d8-67b3349f0c24', '6cda445f-db1e-4202-863e-89707ae89dc9', '7141374c-3216-422c-b3ec-0d35b1b998d7', '7a8ac13a-3b4a-441e-9f28-32b4b791b524', '9d19f0f1-cb8c-4f70-9142-695ac0c2d95f', 'bd424041-bc7b-44d1-8395-b4f8c2071dc9', 'c9445578-b036-4b89-bc7f-3bf18375f547', 'd6ec8d1d-5be1-4c86-8f1d-38a3a147e0a9', 'e55071d8-8374-4403-8b2a-847fe5330096', 'f1939ad1-ac29-4cd2-8e97-5431aed47b09', 'fd26b790-8f08-4164-9cd8-abb5b775a615']",The Dimensions of Facebook Addiction as Measured by Facebook Addiction Italian Questionnaire and Their Relationships with Individual Differences,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",2017
1235,"Big data is revolutionizing how all sectors of our economy do business, including telecommunication, transportation, medical, and finance. Big data comes in two flavors: data at rest and data in motion. Processing data in motion is  stream processing . Stream processing for big data analytics often requires scale that can only be delivered by a distributed system, exploiting parallelism on many hosts and many cores. One such distributed stream processing system is IBM Streams. Early customer experience with IBM Streams uncovered that another core requirement is extensibility, since customers want to build high-performance domain-specific operators for use in their streaming applications. Based on these two core requirements of distribution and extensibility, we designed and implemented the Streams Processing Language (SPL). This article describes SPL with an emphasis on the language design, distributed runtime, and extensibility mechanism. SPL is now the gateway for the IBM Streams platform, used by our customers for stream processing in a broad range of application domains.","['Martin Hirzel', 'Scott Schneider', 'Bugra Gedik']",359ed762-987a-4e9a-9493-f727a3a57abd,50,"['026b77b8-3fa8-4abf-a47b-83c7b0fc77f6', '0393bb49-4a18-479f-909a-c78bd95b18ac', '0b2b5b0c-74d1-486b-88ae-7280fcd09c27', '0cb43811-7049-4c44-aa60-69d83c505dfb', '147512c4-a268-46d7-83df-7a7149a4a5b6', '19db6f2f-ead7-427e-82f1-dc2dec5cda77', '1b915342-04f7-4bd5-ad15-655bf267a7d3', '1c2e1643-4a7e-45c9-bba7-6af345191e86', '1dedf22f-fc51-4885-945c-da580d1385d1', '22880879-035e-4936-bff4-fb6eddbad1be', '230acfa3-aa09-409a-af7d-92ae20c992c7', '29ba9179-8a45-4fb1-a928-1dd695697dfd', '2a64290f-bf99-42a1-a431-ac20fe7ca624', '3061a657-1e98-4936-93e7-d2265311163a', '34454fb4-5a56-4aa5-901d-6d13f7b766bf', '346f6d96-d9e6-4d03-a568-c26e8e82a440', '3730ca24-81f0-456e-a7f3-5c0987e05147', '377b152f-25d9-4ef6-bd6a-445b98310ec8', '3f460340-fd3f-4158-b42c-beffdea8f173', '3fa8f03d-41eb-49e2-b3ae-e45bfb956e70', '42754fe9-0ddd-4b80-9cb8-d244d4258b94', '497520d1-99fe-47a9-a6b5-69ca18f2e13d', '499cceb1-1bdb-49fc-b4e4-af98b87d243d', '4bd59985-ba5c-4402-b625-e0546ecd0191', '4d18d643-88bc-4a39-8bf0-f8e38f05ce63', '5081ba39-ed0e-42a5-ab93-924b341f40c9', '509b914d-daee-4572-94f1-70b0be0bd3d1', '546460c9-2176-4014-847f-79fa6fe942f1', '59af7e25-c0ee-4af5-acea-a58dfe4ccac4', '5fa64e27-882f-419e-82ac-cc959fe672bf', '68a7e1b0-3d07-4fd3-a28d-d32665f5bcad', '79ea58be-2044-405e-add5-849024e8e213', '7a8aa09a-2868-4b00-b179-9efa0ae04884', '7b0c4405-cf77-44f8-a88f-69dfa759750c', '7f871c3e-7efd-4b92-a6f2-10e024cbc34a', '83a5af83-1589-4b3b-808b-c2eb12519880', '91a8fb60-5c1e-4702-8ee4-c2718d37411d', '9a336dbf-e309-4ece-adae-bec7079bf875', 'a2716817-2ad5-4a18-a926-483483a0bb3d', 'a49b27f6-f35b-4977-a130-bfa15872d63e', 'a4a43db5-3512-41b2-bb95-d7f6f83f4db4', 'afa75601-43ff-424f-98ab-0c4f05570b3b', 'b0710653-beb7-4a22-8524-3a5cbb5bce30', 'b09f9b48-c8a5-481d-97d6-e43fdeafd01f', 'b2d94209-4c72-4d81-8615-08de3fcd0901', 'b42cf4f0-e016-4180-b3ae-c3cec5e78d1c', 'c10648b8-0dc5-430d-98fb-46067dd9692b', 'c253f807-5694-41ca-9b3b-df9a52a2806a', 'c2622a12-863c-4ae1-86aa-ecbe8a45287f', 'c2d66166-d756-4e71-b9b0-5b03e5901353', 'c41259e2-1c4f-4d0f-bd98-8432b83fa16e', 'c9d256b0-1003-44ba-8462-2fb65b7ad997', 'cec830d3-eb77-49ca-bd64-3ef15cd6a20c', 'd23a56b9-2ea9-4b8f-b004-54ebac08a81d', 'd4b39238-8fa8-4ce7-b5d7-34a321cf0ced', 'd66c58dc-4add-4ec2-b22a-5a8a8cd6ec1d', 'd80fa7bc-5bd9-426c-a132-2e1e6cfeb89e', 'dc2e27cb-6a12-496c-b7fb-1f21317edc14', 'e58b59fa-9c9f-432e-aa10-3a507d00c809', 'e5ff00dd-59a3-4ed0-adea-4e89ce0e90e1', 'e7f62301-11e9-4136-ac2b-4e3494aa19fb', 'eca13094-8f5b-4f18-bae3-4e749be2c64c', 'ecf66fb3-a138-4bbb-a8df-48a8530e82e0', 'ef385956-9f52-4d91-825d-eaa1f1225d1d']",SPL: An Extensible Language for Distributed Stream Processing,ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems,2017
1236,"The purpose of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is to find general trends in the huge lists of genes or proteins generated by many functional genomics techniques and bioinformatics analyses. Here we present SetRank, an advanced GSEA algorithm which is able to eliminate many false positive hits. The key principle of the algorithm is that it discards gene sets that have initially been flagged as significant, if their significance is only due to the overlap with another gene set. The algorithm is explained in detail and its performance is compared to that of other methods using objective benchmarking criteria. Furthermore, we explore how sample source bias can affect the results of a GSEA analysis. The benchmarking results show that SetRank is a highly specific tool for GSEA. Furthermore, we show that the reliability of results can be improved by taking sample source bias into account. SetRank is available as an R package and through an online web interface.","['Cedric Simillion', 'Robin Liechti', 'Heidi E.L.

1237,"Abstract#R##N##R##N#In an earlier article [J. Schubert, “On nonspecific evidence,” Int. J. Intell. Syst. 8(6), 711–725 (1993)] we established within Dempster-Shafer theory a criterion function called the metaconflict function. With this criterion we can partition into subsets a set of several pieces of evidence with propositions that are weakly specified in the sense that it may be uncertain to which event a proposition is referring. Each subset in the partitioning is representing a separate event. The metaconflict function was derived as the plausibility that the partitioning is correct when viewing the conflict in Dempster's rule within each subset as a newly constructed piece of metalevel evidence with a proposition giving support against the entire partitioning. In this article we extend the results of the previous article. We will not only find the most plausible subset for each piece of evidence as was done in the earlier article. In addition we will specify each piece of nonspecific evidence, in the sense that we find to which events the proposition might be referring, by finding the plausibility for every subset that this piece of evidence belong to the subset. In doing this we will automatically receive indication that some evidence might be false. We will then develop a new methodology to exploit these newly specified pieces of evidence in a subsequent reasoning process. This will include methods to discount evidence based on their degree of falsity and on their degree of credibility due to a partial specification of affiliation, as well as a refined method to infer the event of each subset. © 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",['Johan Schubert'],d6422e97-9ac1-47e1-9b24-a254d32c3f19,50,"['0a3024f6-e83d-41f8-b45e-2808fe9b5b3e', '358f1560-4eba-4370-9474-a38de625b442', '7eabaeaa-46be-453e-9a6f-4f26e0a1f261', '81dceb9f-1112-4c7a-830a-56d918f2809f', '8e3f2852-4bcb-4851-bc92-a6e04f5c4bc1', 'b1b2b0c7-2857-403a-b6a0-d24ee23a04cd', 'c13acc05-aff9-4ee5-8699-2e2375e3f635', 'e7487823-babb-4eca-afad-c213ff228507']",Specifying nonspecific evidence,International Journal of Intelligent Systems,1996
1238,"In this paper we introduce a global differentiator based on higher-order sliding modes (HOSM) and dynamic gains to solve the problem of trajectory tracking via output-feedback for a class of uncertain nonlinear plants with arbitrary relative degree and disturbances. Norm observers for the unmeasured state are employed to dominate the disturbances as well as to adapt the gains of the proposed differentiator since the nonlinearities may be state-dependent and time-varying. Uniform global stability and robust exact tracking are guaranteed employing the proposed HOSM based exact differentiator. The obtained results are not restricted to first-order sliding mode control feedback, but applies for second order sliding mode algorithms (twisting, super-twisting and variable gain super-twisting) as well as quasi-continuous HOSM finite-time controllers. Simulations with an aircraft pitch-control application illustrate the claimed properties, even in the presence of measurement noise.","['Tiago Roux Oliveira', 'Antonio Estrada', 'Leonid Fridman']",757007a9-7b67-4a23-a163-2825563d2602,0,"['1214a65d-a2b4-49f6-84f6-dddd5d9527f6', '15fc4d52-cccb-450c-bbd7-11b162c5c5b8', '350ac447-1234-495a-a02e-b5c980caf656', '36954711-f6c0-45d0-bf77-b94452290f9c', '51ad429f-3eb5-4df0-a49a-97baca811689', '8526f951-3c69-44fc-93c3-4e01d24b235d', '8b907bce-90d5-48b8-87c0-78c95407b204', '9e7d26ac-9780-4e10-9916-60124c1d3d37', 'ac5ab225-eb20-4bf9-92f5-89be1f721d42', 'ec9dfbb0-7769-46b8-a69f-4f1740aab726', 'f0f1439d-05af-4561-9051-9690dda1235d']",Global and exact HOSM differentiator with dynamic gains for output-feedback sliding mode control ☆,Automatica,2017

Also, this is a good opportunity to make a case-study of performance of various lock instances, implemented in the TBB package.

1240,"Bradykinesia is a cardinal symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and describes the slowness of movement revealed in patients. Current PD therapies are based on dopamine replacement, and given that bradykinesia is the symptom that best correlates with the dopaminergic deficiency, the knowledge of its fluctuations may be useful in the diagnosis, treatment and better understanding of the disease progression. This paper evaluates a machine learning method that analyses the signals provided by a triaxial accelerometer placed on the waist of PD patients in order to automatically assess bradykinetic gait unobtrusively. This method employs Support Vector Machines to determine those parts of the signals corresponding to gait. The frequency content of strides is then used to determine bradykinetic walking bouts and to estimate bradykinesia severity based on an epsilon-Support Vector Regression model. The method is validated in 12 PD patients, which leads to two main conclusions. Firstly, the frequency content of the strides allows for the dichotomic detection of bradykinesia with an accuracy higher than 90%. This process requires the use of a patient-dependant threshold that is estimated based on a leave-one-patient-out regression model. Secondly, bradykinesia severity measured through UPDRS scores is approximated by means of a regression model with errors below 10%. Although the method has to be further validated in more patients, results obtained suggest that the presented approach can be successfully used to rate bradykinesia in the daily life of PD patients unobtrusively.","['Albert Samà', 'Carlos Pérez-López', 'Daniel Rodríguez-Martín', 'Andreu Català', 'Juan Manuel Moreno-Aróstegui', 'Joan Cabestany', 'E. de Mingo', 'Alejandro Rodríguez-Molinero']",50d7c606-fd4b-4318-800e-cf6eef9e1888,50,"['01b486c4-8955-403b-a0c6-1de74298b215', '4167ec39-2f58-4e60-b78b-fb284d79e508', '6ff363fe-bed8-4cea-bda0-eac7a1dd8c36', 'c8a472d5-6931-4c5a-b77e-25035c9dbfdc', 'e1c2bb58-ea1a-4982-899a-6b7b0fe03e4b']",Estimating bradykinesia severity in Parkinson's disease by analysing gait through a waist-worn sensor,Computers in Biology and Medicine,2017
1241,"Attributed graph clustering, also known as community detection on attributed graphs, attracts much interests recently due to the ubiquity of attributed graphs in real life. Many existing algorithms have been proposed for this problem, which are either distance based or model based. However, model selection in attributed graph clustering has not been well addressed, that is, most existing algorithms assume the cluster number to be known a priori. In this paper, we propose two efficient approaches for attributed graph clustering with automatic model selection. The first approach is a popular Bayesian nonparametric method, while the second approach is an asymptotic method based on a recently proposed model selection criterion, factorized information criterion. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approaches for attributed graph clustering with automatic model selection significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm.","['Zhiqiang Xu', 'James Cheng', 'Xiaokui Xiao', 'Ryohei Fujimaki', 'Yusuke Muraoka']",77a1ff47-daf5-428d-a56c-6c44a2897e1e,0,"['0015f976-6fcd-4dba-843d-38e22db3a106', '06dc0648-62ce-4357-8fb5-9d0dbd83faed', '14e9fff7-f3ef-43fe-94ff-e7d8815c3201', '1bc10bbb-215a-4fab-a835-2fe7d1821c85', '24902bc1-0b86-4959-93f3-6c62a56b69ed', '28903e7b-aa3b-4840-b634-916029ed6c77', '32d18b97-b9f3-4b43-8eed-c91ec375b527', '440ab2d5-3af6-4a67-9ddb-d1a7b6693063', '472b35d2-6e21-4a78-8345-827bf52e540e', '5ddd0b48-b61c-41ea-a41c-8e92dbfd21d9', '5fcbf803-e461-4e8d-ae9c-1bbc7ad5afcb', '60988ff4-5a48-4908-af24-44122274a7b5', '61d5d288-a0cd-4df2-96fc-4d346b7dabc7', '77b83128-db4d-4e35-a34a-581a2fe778ca', '7abd5ce4-3aff-4598-b897-9009959fc8db', '7d2b008c-37ca-4ac4-88a9-056aad9916d6', '7dd1b051-4aec-4d5f-bcab-0363e7b96ea5', '8ac756f6-f734-43d9-8b9d-faea052955fe', '9b877784-d99c-42fd-a6dd-0918cda5a13e', '9ccecc76-2928-4d4d-b935-7b8f3a686a0e', 'afc8a2f6-e9a5-4805-a4b0-7cb97be6df87', 'b435fb01-094e-4e31-9ce5-27bd4a401c5d', 'b512ec15-3fbc-485f-9c54-7ea33e19a3fc', 'b68e6982-981f-4207-9c6c-da0b4cc79ae4', 'cede414d-501e-4247-a650-42240f00a401', 'de7a7b99-28db-4ecd-82ea-b40609d7b456', 'e44dd299-7eb0-48d4-9def-f43e36124c0b', 'e95957bf-063a-4a55-8496-c3890204f1e2', 'e9c0ab60-6254-498b-879e-d6d075029e1e', 'f9b3e41e-ec46-4ad7-8a8f-abb43612190f', 'fb244d98-60f6-40f8-8c42-a233dfa5843f']",Efficient nonparametric and asymptotic Bayesian model selection methods for attributed graph clustering,Knowledge and Information Systems,2017
1242,"Molodtsov's soft set theory provides a general mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty in decision-making. In the past few years, a large number of generalized soft set concepts and approaches to decision-making have been studied by many researchers. This paper considers a new generalization of Molodtsov's soft set concept, named linguistic value soft set, by introducing a linguistic variable to the definition of soft set theory. Then, the information in several soft sets can be saved in one linguistic value soft set. We define basic notions such as the equality of two linguistic value soft sets, and the subsets and complement of a linguistic soft set. Next, we present the binary operations for linguistic value soft set theory. Then, we discuss the properties of linguistic value soft set for the basic notions and binary operations. Further, we define the concept of linguistic value soft matrix and choice value matrix of a linguistic value soft set, and we discuss the operation laws. By using these new definitions of linguistic value soft set theory, we establish a new approach to multiple criteria group decision-making problems with linguistic value information. We present a detailed description of the decision-making problem and the decision steps. Finally, the validity of the proposed decision-making method is tested by a numerical example with the background of an evaluation decision problem for automobiles. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. One is to propose the concept of linguistic value soft set and establish the main results of the theoretical aspect for the new generalization form. Another is to present a new approach to multiple attribute group decision-making based on linguistic value soft set.","['Bingzhen Sun', 'Weimin Ma', 'Xiaonan Li']",268abc0e-2c66-4d2f-96b8-981b3ad4f44d,0,"['130241df-030e-469a-822a-65897466a5af', '1a9a5b02-260c-4b0a-8f0e-cee18976dfc6', '26e6025e-6616-4e0c-a4fa-31273678bd77', '2c2c3da5-173a-467a-96a6-be63bd6c88a5', '35479825-60dc-46b3-9be8-151668eaefd0', '37d88a05-8ab7-4b34-b2b4-3138df40f745', '3a020424-fc05-44c1-9e14-f2ffb4fa7cbf', '3a987416-ee58-4e87-940b-b4cecc487c93', '3b7d74b6-146b-4171-9d68-7d9ed5cc020b', '47279bb8-f745-4589-b008-bbda4960e735', '4a382a95-e658-42ef-a355-6c8d26d12a50', '4bd24b96-80f3-45e6-bdc7-bdb279a06de2', '519570f1-0d7c-4051-94da-6439c6ef9f3e', '56b25c4f-d0b6-4f73-a1bd-b9d87b668cb6', '5a840ac6-e91d-446c-81ff-f8f0e85f8139', '5f549229-9943-4561-81a5-8f9740f6bd23', '66b3a9a6-60a0-43ff-a546-0598fd7ab172', '8b6b6c9b-d3c5-4fff-a24d-b092e506f81c', '96854277-a0be-4545-971a-59d01ed38707', '969f0c12-1b9c-407a-ae1c-49d07dd6d6e9', '9898ea1d-bcce-42e9-83ee-50a8c24802a9', '993d4630-3e02-46cd-95a3-7c39fe6b8470', '9fe6d686-6efd-4414-b709-21f840d9aff1', 'a1e7e56e-eba1-4fe5-9fa8-aca8ad10a5ee', 'a776c2f4-e5ae-4091-81dc-ad7d7c330897', 'abb6edfc-5eb2-4d8c-82db-48a82621c529', 'ad601075-db55-4121-ba49-329fbb67d1ef', 'c26e4e7f-9ba2-4295-a056-cab6e3279b55', 'cb0e9fca-7823-4a3d-8ad4-afa1112e9582', 'cb1dafb9-317b-48f8-94a5-84e8caf87d03', 'cd13fec9-0a7b-4061-8f44-6b0b5c92defe', 'ce4c8315-55f7-4e16-b1f0-56491ed290ce', 'd1e6a93d-9b6d-47e3-99bf-8351aedf2c35', 'd3dec473-526b-4860-bd50-486d60650fdc', 'e28da43b-4f7d-49b2-801d-95163891415e', 'fa61194d-ddc4-4e9c-8d1d-dfbed40a24d2', 'fe6b104f-a755-4097-99f1-3e5db7cffb1f']",Linguistic value soft set-based approach to multiple criteria group decision-making,Applied Soft Computing,2017
1243,"Presence is one of the most important psychological constructs for understanding human-computer interaction. However, different terminology and operationalizations of presence across fields have plagued the comparability and generalizability of results across studies. Lee's (2004) unified understanding of presence as a multidimensional construct made up of physical, social, and self-presence, has created a unified theory of presence; nevertheless, there are still no psychometrically valid measurement instruments based on the theory. Two studies were conducted that describe the development of a standardized multidimensional measure of presence (the MPS) for a VR learning context based on this theory, and its validation using confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory. The results from Study 1 which included 161 medical students from Denmark indicated that the items used in the MPS measure a three dimensional theoretical model of presence: physical, social, and self-presence. Furthermore, IRT analyses indicated that it was possible to limit the number of items in the MPS to 15 (five items per sub-dimension) while maintaining the construct validity and reliability of the measure. The results of Study 2, which included 118 biology students from Scotland, supported the validity and generalizability of the MPS in a new context.","['Guido Makransky', 'Lau Lilleholt', 'Anders Aaby']",73438f48-eddc-46d2-9b9b-0252e56cd64d,50,"['6103166a-66b4-4cd5-84af-603f5f852f7c', 'b6ec5569-40d0-400d-8887-5d3a1bcfe38d', 'e0f7a292-6a66-4d96-871f-28f990eda895', 'fa39aca8-a0c9-4b36-bb78-b1cd1e1a5cf1']",Development and validation of the Multimodal Presence Scale for virtual reality environments: A confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory approach,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
1244,"Inspired by the success of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in text-independent speaker recognition, we have recently demonstrated that similar ideas can also be applied to the text-dependent speaker verification task. In this paper, we describe new advances with our state-of-the-art i-vector based approach to text-dependent speaker verification, which also makes use of different DNN techniques. In order to collect sufficient statistics for i-vector extraction, different frame alignment models are compared such as GMMs, phonemic HMMs or DNNs trained for senone classification. We also experiment with DNN based bottleneck features and their combinations with standard MFCC features. We experiment with few different DNN configurations and investigate the importance of training DNNs on 16 kHz speech. The results are reported on RSR2015 dataset, where training material is available for all possible enrollment and test phrases. Additionally, we report results also on more challenging RedDots dataset, where the system is built in truly phrase-independent way.","['Hossein Zeinali', 'Hossein Sameti', 'Lukas Burget', 'Jan Cernocký']",12eb7de5-10a9-4e99-8298-64a8ab5ed7b7,0,"['0e5d5ac2-b07c-4dc9-aa83-21f4e6395e11', '16b82cfb-8029-4733-9ddd-4ca759abe0e4', '1cc8db6e-76db-4356-9201-d34736483941', '28368a5e-9c4c-485b-8bd1-e704b446c668', '334f5ca6-f825-45f3-b719-6b88123870f4', '352c9c10-747c-48ba-84c2-dbfdf67e83aa', '3f2f93e5-8e34-4eb0-9623-0bbf40ea63f1', '3fff6c89-5702-48a3-baa3-1a0dd031de01', '408683a0-e7c1-48f0-a0a8-7030fe8c2c93', '4f795b55-e494-43ce-9163-fd609a29a129', '506f963d-dd44-4891-b0d5-862485a5edd1', '54bc43f5-6db1-4ac3-b032-ed876d4aa9e6', '5781743b-057e-40f8-9514-54434d1fd0b0', '59f65a51-1d21-4f56-9224-88409829a12b', '68c06a93-7fb7-4267-bbe3-92dd8c811680', '718acbe6-3e8c-4abe-b546-4490e91afd8a', '7212d82d-74fb-4381-bdca-13b825262e6d', '8818f0d5-5263-459e-a033-95571f6e228d', '89cc0b03-fe18-4530-9da4-20bd2f7c2b58', '8e6522ae-f778-4b17-ae42-f4db3f0dc97b', '92738be5-920e-4596-8fc8-99cc2f3bcfc2', '947ba0e2-ce1c-4e0f-9d0d-8c3c150cc48b', '97cf7f10-646e-48d0-b408-c7339aa514fc', 'a004ebb1-ae7f-4f52-9541-0b273e8fee9c', 'a7478a4b-8f31-4ed7-8ea0-c3240aafb6bd', 'a84bd7ad-84d2-4788-ba9b-1ec5189b2457', 'ae22966a-0564-44bc-9be2-3d5111b1a6bd', 'af868768-1025-489b-9bda-aaf68a306a88', 'b54e083b-f292-4e82-b126-193fc2b6dfb3', 'b8269cfc-76b9-40ea-8a61-a4d52c91493d', 'c296c72d-405f-439e-8b02-3792af902c9d', 'cdb50aae-5864-40ba-b8cd-0388ad9f36d7', 'eec205e1-30f3-4b0b-987c-768ad88bb65e', 'efdc43ad-7029-4199-bfb0-e28168311089']","Text-dependent speaker verification based on i-vectors, Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Models ☆",Computer Speech & Language,2017

1246,"We consider two-receiver broadcast channels where each receiver may know a priori some of the messages requested by the other receiver as receiver message side information (RMSI). We devise a general approach to leverage RMSI in these channels. To this end, we first propose a pre-coding scheme considering the general message setup where each receiver requests both common and private messages and knows a priori part of the private message requested by the other receiver as RMSI. We then construct the transmission scheme of a two-receiver channel with RMSI by applying the proposed pre-coding scheme to the best transmission scheme for the channel without RMSI. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our pre-coding scheme to three categories of the two-receiver discrete memoryless broadcast channel: (i) channel without state; (ii) channel with states known causally to the transmitter; and (iii) channel with states known non-causally to the transmitter. We then derive a unified inner bound for all three categories. We show that our inner bound is tight for some new cases in each of the three categories, as well as all cases whose capacity region was known previously.","['Behzad Asadi', 'Lawrence Ong', 'Sarah J.

We consider the case when we are given a set of pattern trees as a regular tree language and investigate the state complexity. Based on the sequential and parallel tree concatenation, we define three types of tree languages for deciding the existence of different types of subtree occurrences.

1248,"Personalizing computer-based testing services to examinees can be improved by considering their behavioral models. This study aims to contribute towards deeper understanding the examinee’s time-spent and achievement behavior during testing according to the five personality traits by exploiting assessment analytics. Further, it aims to investigate assessment analytics appropriateness for classifying students and generating enhanced student models to guide personalization of testing services. In this study, the LAERS assessment environment and the Big Five Inventory were used to track the response times of 112 undergraduate students and to extract their personality traits respectively. Partial Least Squares was used to detect fundamental relationships between the collected data, and Supervised Learning Algorithms were used to classify students. Results indicate a positive effect of extraversion and agreeableness on goal-expectancy, a positive effect of conscientiousness on both goal-expectancy and level of certainty, and a negative effect of neuroticism and openness on level of certainty. Further, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness have statistically significant indirect impact on students’ response-times and level of achievement. Moreover, the ensemble RandomForest method provides accurate classification results, indicating that a time-spent driven description of students’ behavior could have added value towards dynamically reshaping the respective models. Further implications of these findings are also discussed.","['Zacharoula Papamitsiou', 'Anastasios A.

1250,"AbstractThis study examines key drivers of firms’ green information technology (IT) practices. A hierarchical view, premised in institutional theory and competitive dynamics, leads to a model that explains firms’ practices. This model includes factors that pertain to the environment (environmental awareness and government regulations), industry (industry norms and competitors’ green practices), and firm (customers’ and equity holders’ attitudes and internal readiness) levels. Survey data collected from 304 major firms in Taiwan are used to test the model and hypotheses.

1251,"The Minkowski weighted K-means (MWK-means) is a recently developed clustering algorithm capable of computing feature weights. The cluster-specific weights in MWK-means follow the intuitive idea that a feature with low variance should have a greater weight than a feature with high variance. The final clustering found by this algorithm depends on the selection of the Minkowski distance exponent. This paper explores the possibility of using the central Minkowski partition in the ensemble of all Minkowski partitions for selecting an optimal value of the Minkowski exponent. The central Minkowski partition appears to be also a good consensus partition. Furthermore, we discovered some striking correlation results between the Minkowski profile, defined as a mapping of the Minkowski exponent values into the average similarity values of the optimal Minkowski partitions, and the Adjusted Rand Index vectors resulting from the comparison of the obtained partitions to the ground truth. Our findings were confirmed by a series of computational experiments involving synthetic Gaussian clusters and real-world data.","['Renato Cordeiro de Amorim', 'Andrei Shestakov', 'Boris G.

1252,"The spatially localized spherical Fourier transform has been studied for various applications in recent years. One of the main arguments of the transform is the window function, typically selected to provide localization in space and to enable spectral analysis of specific parts of the sphere. In the discrete formulation of the transform, window functions with a finite spherical harmonics order are used. However, this imposes a constraint, as a high-order window leads to a high number of sampling points on the sphere in order to facilitate inversion of the transform without errors. In this work, a novel method for designing window functions is proposed, with the aim of removing the sampling constraint and, therefore, reducing the number of sampling points on the sphere, while retaining a high order for the window. This is achieved by projecting the window design to a subspace that constrains the sum of all rotated windows to be a constant function on the sphere. The method is formulated mathematically and validated by simulations, which demonstrate its performance and limitations.","['Uri Abend', 'Boaz Rafaely']",725f902d-3b9a-4bf1-bc54-9ec82fe67e71,0,"['78c3d195-84cf-4baf-afdd-6f3d0f47e63c', 'a018b3eb-6003-4201-aa80-6212d6d82fb3', 'a0e62f4f-2f09-4bb7-aea8-ca42aa56fc7d', 'b164f893-f754-484c-9e25-05a676cc3997', 'dad67184-8ed9-471c-99ab-6885fa4cd7ca']",Efficient inverse spatially localized spherical Fourier transform with kernel partitioning of the sphere,Signal Processing,2017
1253,"This study considers a ticket seller who can use three different display formats: displaying all, displaying partial, and displaying no information, to reveal the number of remaining seats of the event, and determines the corresponding optimal pricing strategies when facing myopic and strategic customers as well as a speculator. We investigate the effects that the three different display formats have on the customers’ willingness to make a purchase and the speculator’s speculative behavior. The results show that displaying no information enables customers to guess the number of remaining tickets only based on the status of ticket sales when entering the market, and, as a result, they would perceive the highest shortage risk. Displaying partial information hinders customers with regard to accurately predicting the sales, which increases their perception of future shortage risk, and thus more strategic customers would purchase tickets at the presale stage. Additionally, this intensive purchase behavior would also attract more speculators to enter the market, which, would enhance the total sales and reduce the risk of unsalable tickets for the seller. With regard to profitability, the ticket seller earns the most profit when displaying no information, followed by displaying partial information and then displaying all information, since the less the information about remaining seats that is available, the greater the perception of shortage risk, and thus the more ticket sales that are made.","['Yeu-Shiang Huang', 'Jun-Guo Wang', 'Jyh-Wen Ho']",3b90ec20-08f1-4b45-93c8-db5e2dafced3,0,"['03aade3a-b315-4c69-85c8-313141a7ec68', '42fff44c-769c-46eb-9b5c-60401c02781a', '4e55d3df-16ff-45cf-bf1f-38054efd97bf', '5a47a35c-10c0-4766-a564-f21a5305d3ef', '5ce06a69-c8b7-4f79-a064-d81ffba8ac27', '60610ad2-634a-42a6-8991-7dea75d8c5c7', '6fe30d2b-3e14-4866-a8a3-0dff2c61487a', '84e61394-6cf5-4845-8586-c2798ac8ba6b', '8ce23e57-cf29-4213-b0aa-72522d46f962', 'aa360a4c-f9a8-4000-bcc9-f094fd869f53', 'abb30e6f-de3b-4332-864a-73f9e42ec2ab', 'afa330a8-2a18-4d91-8c4a-e36e558f1743', 'b3c5a574-b6e1-4767-8c11-fb78281a0b1d', 'c6246b4b-c9f3-43cd-b386-588f0767d817', 'ce6addf7-1156-44e5-8cdf-c4ae444075e6', 'fe014719-d0b4-437a-af29-1fac0fca6b53', 'ffe8010e-d5a6-444d-a8cc-f06646125e8d']",Ticket Pricing with Different Inventory Information Displays,Computers & Industrial Engineering,2017
1254,"Image watermarking in wavelet domain has been found useful for copyright protection and rightful ownership. Classical wavelet transforms, like discrete wavelet transform (DWT), are shift sensitive and provide information in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions only. Shift invariance and directional information are required for better reconstruction of images. In this work, we propose a semi-blind gray scale image watermarking technique in redundant wavelet domain. The primary focus of this research is to highlight the usefulness of redundant wavelet transforms in image watermarking. We have used nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and redundant discrete wavelet transform (RDWT). These redundant transforms are shift invariant. Also, NSCT provides rich directional information. Thus, they overcome the shortcomings of DWT and are more useful in image watermarking. We have integrated singular value decomposition (SVD) in the proposed method. We use NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition for single and dual image watermarking. For single watermark embedding, cover images are sub-sampled followed by one level NSCT and RDWT decomposition. SVD has been applied on obtained RDWT coefficients. In the same way, image watermark has been processed and NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition has been applied on it. SVD coefficients of the cover image and watermark image have been combined using scaling factor. Inverse SVD-RDWT-NSCT operation together with reverse sub-sampling provides watermarked image. For extraction of the watermark, we follow the NSCT-RDWT-SVD decomposition and SVD coefficients have been separated by the same scaling factor that was used in embedding. In the dual watermarking, Arnold transform has been used for encryption of the text watermark and rest of the steps are similar to single watermarking. NSCT, RDWT and SVD improve the performance of the proposed method against geometrical and image processing attacks for single and dual image watermarking. Experiments have been carried over standard images and results have been shown for natural and medical images. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), correlation coefficient (CC), bit error rate (BER) and structural similarity index metric (SSIM) show that the proposed method is suitable for single and dual image watermarking, and outperforms existing methods.","['Siddharth Singh', 'Vivek Singh Rathore', 'Rajiv Singh', 'Manoj Kumar Singh']",781af336-3c71-4c30-b1a3-7ca3094f7430,0,"['04a89039-111c-4249-9905-09abbe322068', '09468ada-0dd0-45e0-b576-5b001cab899f', '0e49971e-0c20-4306-a7fc-5ec68b59f21b', '1be8a7e9-1030-46c1-a2f0-81551f7bf62b', '1e9ebfde-db77-49e0-8e95-c1e2e7ad988e', '22c09b2c-4645-482e-8604-2a5a8df9eb88', '28327372-feba-4b99-8b17-f84e21894448', '38c8832c-bf38-43ac-a839-302435448cd2', '3ab6c503-2dd5-4bc7-8f60-70b99d552583', '3bc84ef4-2280-46d4-9f4a-dc883a0766e4', '3c59b871-56d0-4134-a972-3fd69581eb32', '54190bee-74ab-4c59-836c-0c0770f43121', '54651d5d-91e2-48a7-9d88-d4c2ac8c4e71', '5998af04-51a6-46af-8438-3f8d62596aed', '5d76a40f-cc7c-40ff-abcd-ccd5913925f6', '601644f5-06f7-43d4-b878-3712fefe31ac', '71491542-b5e6-46ec-b6bd-48c09e6ca561', '7d665369-a6d1-4aad-bb1b-c445606b21d5', '7dab73ba-bc7c-4a15-9842-1f8857fad071', '7dc66530-c6a2-4622-9676-d30e657738af', '81917844-013f-4340-9625-038c9180599e', '95cd1c38-3f98-4610-ae95-fc228a3b3c82', '9ecdb851-481c-4474-bdce-342febe011a4', 'a115a02a-eae0-4eb9-bc3c-223fee36c1b7', 'a24e8fa8-81d9-4fba-ab50-fd32642b8906', 'adbf02af-0c0c-4476-ac4b-b3b6e6a6d95c', 'b17067b1-5ae9-46f6-9853-ea0046056c37', 'c0153e6a-29cc-4a2a-a28f-1b96cccb17b0', 'c253b916-8b58-4f73-821b-3bc688b547e8', 'cd565d6f-78b8-4292-8cdd-793b765f2295', 'd9c1c412-c28a-4db5-8d16-ceb876713781', 'e11cdb9e-fd19-4da6-ba39-da185fb77939', 'fb30a901-0c77-4e62-805c-7b30f33208dc']",Hybrid semi-blind image watermarking in redundant wavelet domain,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2017

The most significant step in the cryptanalysis of Salsa and ChaCha is the idea of Probabilistic Neutral Bits, which was introduced by Aumasson et al. (FSE 2008). After that, no significant improvement is achieved in the procedure of choosing Probabilistic Neutral Bits. The works in this direction mostly were concerned about forward probabilities. In this paper, we give a new algorithm to construct Probabilistic Neutral Bits. We use this algorithm to improve the existing attacks for reduced rounds of both Salsa and ChaCha.

1256,"This work is a detailed companion reproducibility paper of the methods and experiments proposed by Lastra-Diaz and Garcia-Serrano in (2015, 2016) [56–58], which introduces the following contributions: (1) a new and efficient representation model for taxonomies, called PosetHERep, which is an adaptation of the half-edge data structure commonly used to represent discrete manifolds and planar graphs; (2) a new Java software library called the Half-Edge Semantic Measures Library (HESML) based on PosetHERep, which implements most ontology-based semantic similarity measures and Information Content (IC) models reported in the literature; (3) a set of reproducible experiments on word similarity based on HESML and ReproZip with the aim of exactly reproducing the experimental surveys in the three aforementioned works; (4) a replication framework and dataset, called WNSimRep v1, whose aim is to assist the exact replication of most methods reported in the literature; and finally, (5) a set of scalability and performance benchmarks for semantic measures libraries. PosetHERep and HESML are motivated by several drawbacks in the current semantic measures libraries, especially the performance and scalability, as well as the evaluation of new methods and the replication of most previous methods. The reproducible experiments introduced herein are encouraged by the lack of a set of large, self-contained and easily reproducible experiments with the aim of replicating and confirming previously reported results. Likewise, the WNSimRep v1 dataset is motivated by the discovery of several contradictory results and difficulties in reproducing previously reported methods and experiments. PosetHERep proposes a memory-efficient representation for taxonomies which linearly scales with the size of the taxonomy and provides an efficient implementation of most taxonomy-based algorithms used by the semantic measures and IC models, whilst HESML provides an open framework to aid research into the area by providing a simpler and more efficient software architecture than the current software libraries. Finally, we prove the outperformance of HESML on the state-of-the-art libraries, as well as the possibility of significantly improving their performance and scalability without caching using PosetHERep.","['Juan J.

1257,"In 1965, Motzkin–Straus established the connection between the maximum cliques and the Lagrangian of a graph, the maximum value of a quadratic function determined by a graph in the standard simplex. This connection gave a proof of the Turan’s classical result on Turan densities of complete graphs. In 1980’s, Sidorenko and Frankl–Furedi further developed this method for hypergraph Turan problems. However, the connection between the Lagrangian and the maximum cliques of a graph cannot be extended to hypergraphs. In 2009, S. Rota Bulo and M. Pelillo defined a homogeneous polynomial function of degree   r     r        determined by an   r     r       -uniform hypergraph and gave the connection between the minimum value of this polynomial function and the maximum cliques of an   r     r       -uniform hypergraph. In this paper, we provide a connection between the local (global) minimizers of non-homogeneous polynomial functions to the maximal (maximum) cliques of hypergraphs whose edges containing   r−1     r  −  1        and   r     r        vertices. This connection can be applied to obtain an upper bound on the Turan densities of complete   {r−1,r},      {  r  −  1  ,  r  },        -type hypergraphs.","['Biao Wu', 'Yuejian Peng']",8487ba55-8269-43b5-8a75-5df4b709ef1d,0,"['029b4a25-5427-4c0a-8d8a-862504641b25', '251ce37d-c9c2-4514-9f68-6ddbd8239506', '4554397a-94ee-4939-a620-142ea062defb', '4ed2736a-c70a-4663-a813-0ca6e9738331', '4f554379-680f-4f30-9f28-449b533389e3', '54efa741-4b07-4090-9464-3ceb71066627', 'e8c9c0d9-0ef4-46c7-80c9-898b495e5f6f', 'f385613b-2b69-44c5-b9b6-b392373c0f3c']","The connection between polynomial optimization, maximum cliques and Turán densities",Discrete Applied Mathematics,2017
1258,"Standard displacement-based finite elements are known to display overstiff behavior known as locking phenomenon for a wide variety of problems. To overcome this problem, hybrid elements have been proposed in the literature. They are based on a two-field variational principle, and involve an interpolation for the stress field that is chosen independently of that of the displacement field. Due to this independent choice of the stress interpolation, hybrid elements are less susceptible to the locking phenomenon, and thus provide better coarse mesh accuracy as compared to the displacement-based formulation. Hybrid elements are versatile elements with which one can model shell structures, almost incompressible materials as well as ‘chunky’ geometries. In this work, we use hybrid elements for the space discretization along with a  higher-order  momentum conserving variant of the time finite element method. The time finite element method provides a general variational framework for developing arbitrary-order time-stepping strategies for transient problems. It has been shown in the literature recently that for discrete chaotic systems the quadratic time finite element scheme is computationally more efficient and robust when compared to the linear time finite element strategy. In this work, we present a modified form of the quadratic time finite element method for the solution of nonlinear elastodynamics problems that conserves linear and angular momenta exactly, and energy in an approximate sense in the fully discrete setting. We present numerous examples to demonstrate the efficacy of hybrid elements over conventional elements within the context of the modified quadratic time finite element method. From our examples, we observe that for chaotic systems, the proposed strategy is significantly more computationally efficient compared to the linear transient strategy; however in other problems although the performance is good, it does not offer any significant computational advantage.","['Manish Agrawal', 'C.

1259,"In this paper we put under the same umbrella several well known results and establish several new results related to the shape based tools which treat the objects ellipticity issues. We start with a derivation of an explicit and closed formula for the computation of the ellipticity measures, from an infinite family, introduced recently. The new formula enables a fast computation of such measures, since it does not require any optimizing procedure for the computation, as it was the case before. In addition, the established formula enables an easy theoretical manipulation. As a result, we have discovered new shape features, as they are: (i) The average shape ellipticity measure, which might be interpreted as an average value of the estimated similarities between the shape considered and all the ellipses whose axes length ratio belongs to a certain, predefined, interval; (ii) The maximal shape ellipticity measure, which might be understood as the maximal possible similarity estimate between a given shape and an ellipses.#R##N##R##N#Some of the other results obtained relate strongly to the well-known measures and methods broadly used in shape based object analysis tasks.","['Joviša Žunić', 'Ramakrishna Kakarala', 'Mehmet Ali Aktaş']",94f72cc6-cde0-435e-b506-3c3b1f960310,0,"['0ab90603-c78d-4109-a7b7-04a40794bb28', '18e144c5-5222-4303-acbd-653acf63a6a8', '33bd91fd-4fd7-44d5-838d-d29be6ad790d', '441baeda-b89a-4fd2-b50e-9a1191b8d3bf', '4e1ade64-5353-46f3-ad84-569627fa92ea', '52c4f731-b8ba-4c07-887b-ffbd69f58d70', '545946a3-b053-47cc-b2ee-655831e1fab7', '5ccfd3ad-9796-4151-a664-d4fe1137d452', '73ab9fc3-dc79-446b-9ea1-ff80004a157e', '7dd83ea2-710a-4323-a576-8b678ab3f70b', '923f5d0a-23a3-4fb1-bee7-ec72122709a4', '95a8bd89-0fb6-4a27-8f6b-d63f76b813a4', '9fef36b1-f947-40d3-94fa-e75b01adba2c', 'a281f717-1309-4ed3-aa93-d5c11f0be68f', 'a447f8d9-a3a6-437d-857c-e0e33dab8ce1', 'b2d10062-0eeb-408b-81ee-e33518aef2b7', 'b4945afb-69cf-462a-8de8-ddcff47f4618', 'ba307583-2211-44d1-ae25-c785887c01be', 'f5510a89-d28c-47aa-9755-e6faad7cd27a', 'fb9c995d-649d-41a4-bfd3-bcb02f025f0d']",Notes on shape based tools for treating the objects ellipticity issues,Pattern Recognition,2017
1260,"Nationwide health information exchange (NHIE) continues to be a persistent concern for government agencies, despite the many efforts and the conceived benefits of sharing patient data among healthcare providers. Difficulties in ensuring global connectivity, interoperability, and concerns on security have always hampered the government from successfully deploying NHIE. By looking at NHIE from a fresh perspective and bearing in mind the pervasiveness and power of modern mobile platforms, this paper proposes a new approach to NHIE that builds on the notion of consumer-mediated HIE, albeit without the focus on central health record banks. With the growing acceptance of smartphones as reliable, indispensable, and most personal devices, we suggest to leverage the concept of mobile personal health records (PHRs installed on smartphones) to the next level. We envision mPHRs that take the form of distributed storage units for health information, under the full control and direct possession of patients, who can have ready access to their personal data whenever needed. However, for the actual exchange of data with health information systems managed by healthcare providers, the latter have to be interoperable with patient-carried mPHRs. Computer industry has long ago solved a similar problem of interoperability between peripheral devices and operating systems. We borrow from that solution the idea of providing special interfaces between mPHRs and provider systems. This interface enables the two entities to communicate with no change to either end. The design and operation of the proposed approach is explained. Additional pointers on potential implementations are provided, and issues that pertain to any solution to implement NHIE are discussed.","['Mohamed Abdulnabi', 'Ahmed Al-Haiqi', 'Miss Laiha Mat Kiah', 'A.

1261,"This paper presents a learned feature based framework for both outdoor and indoor scene labeling. This framework is combined with a discriminative feature learning process to produce the posteriors of every pixel and a novel strategy to improve the global label consistency of a scene. First, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) to learn the most relevant features of a scene at the multi-scale superpixel level. The effect of both trained and general ConvNets features for our scene labeling framework are investigated. Then, based on the predicted posteriors from the learned features, we propose an algorithm called Region Consistency Activation (RCA) to iteratively improve the global label consistency at different levels of the Ultrametric Contour Map (UCM). In addition, we propose a strategy to make the hyper-parameters of RCA adaptive to the test images, which results in a better generalization ability compared with the hyper-parameters tuning based RCA. Our scene labeling framework were rigorously tested on three popular scene labeling datasets: Stanford Background, SIFT Flow and NYU-Depth V2. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently produces better accuracy and visual consistency compared with the state-of-the-art methods for both outdoor and indoor scenes.","['Yandong Li', 'Ferdous Ahmed Sohel', 'Mohammed Bennamoun', 'Hang Lei']",ebc11dbf-a10d-4a2d-8af0-dbaa55a6b532,0,"['031bbeb0-4dc1-46f9-9984-109c3b3eefae', '0aa4fb13-cf05-4062-bfde-2e54e15ff89a', '0b392f48-8d12-4993-bfe4-cb1f711bf08f', '0fb0a842-cb06-4b37-9738-a4d18a55ec23', '28d47fcd-4f94-4de9-b57b-99ba4545b867', '309f11f3-0575-4787-9f2d-d3888c5db5b1', '357628ef-a0a2-4821-b2f8-d8f47b46cb1e', '3b992dca-81b7-426e-8faf-3a3cd03572e0', '40835640-4c9a-4962-bb12-b9b180cf61fe', '470a4f23-7661-44a2-b1fe-a370995631d1', '4b9c17d1-9a08-48a2-95e0-47d3d4452a96', '52637a68-1c71-4b9e-b00d-e171fef72484', '552559cc-0a40-4d5c-bd3e-73970b7fcb9e', '598b4640-ea19-4815-b75f-4382ee17204d', '64fb0edf-8a2e-42a1-b0cc-c5d432392a14', '6a97a03d-7337-4f4a-a8db-714d81cff194', '725ff5fd-76fe-41b4-b50d-00405a51ac27', '7cdbd474-7695-4264-bef5-66e30d074b35', '7d8dbfc5-b7dd-4b1c-9a1c-f0cd9b841b0d', '826bd128-4189-4e04-8e8d-d2ebfd68c432', '84e105e6-d8f4-4438-8626-d0a3dfabf423', '89f10062-acf1-4171-b882-f3222c3a357e', '8db677a7-de9a-476b-ac75-169a962cf6cd', '97fa1c18-05bf-47c9-b72d-5d712b186ccd', 'a8c95c0c-ca1d-4d01-8d03-e655500c9b55', 'aa7cb2b2-3c98-4249-809c-2a599fce83a2', 'b79e9dcb-f19f-47e3-ad8a-80463a19c98e', 'ba44b37d-a45f-4861-ad0d-fee70bb90581', 'bf248c6c-2c05-4101-9a38-35460518f9d7', 'c334891a-21d2-4f6d-8af4-30c8c9f45e3a', 'c514bd88-79ab-423e-a87d-4dd339ab6375', 'c812244d-0de8-4e3c-8133-1e834bc9dbd0', 'c83c828b-e264-495d-8eb8-b2b655c79cb0', 'db11270b-db37-4084-9b78-68ae29964e79', 'e016d598-1090-4b61-98ab-f47c8650dfa7', 'e2f7a74a-8430-4463-94ce-fe85dfd309f9', 'eed77e2b-a3b8-4a25-936e-c6df81d0667d']",Discriminative feature learning and region consistency activation for robust scene labeling,Neurocomputing,2017
1262,"A second-order initial value problem with a small parameter multiplying the first- and second-order derivatives is considered. The precise knowledge about the behavior of the exact solution is analyzed. Based on the behavior of the exact solution, a hybrid finite difference scheme on a Shishkin mesh is proposed, which is a combination of the second-order difference scheme on the fine mesh and the modified midpoint upwind scheme on the coarse mesh. By applying the truncation error estimate techniques and a difference analogue of Gronwall’s inequality we prove that the scheme is almost second-order convergent for numerical solutions and scaled numerical derivatives. Numerical experiments support these theoretical results and indicate that the estimates are sharp.","['Zhongdi Cen', 'Anbo Le', 'Aimin Xu']",eb47282f-07bf-4470-80e9-9e01b3e245c1,0,"['0b8cc3b4-1540-434e-85e3-92861e59fcc9', '3e529535-801b-410b-9a3b-f2a1cef6b8c4', '5a2bd628-1065-4ba8-aad2-0a48c6532214', '665c0135-9739-48ad-9314-5fac273fc837', '80946bfa-171e-4cf5-a1ea-7a7b23a3ddae', '9b701dd7-c668-4dd8-8a00-65c18f95105e', 'bbfaefdb-960a-48b4-9960-17beaceae82c', 'c4bbd959-43d5-43a7-89ab-d180e3cd4159', 'dad5ab2b-6004-40a8-87a7-46bb5023ce82']",Parameter-uniform hybrid difference scheme for solutions and derivatives in singularly perturbed initial value problems,Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics,2017

1264,"Supply chain model is very complex and it does not depend on only retailer or buyer-vendor. So we have developed a three layer supply chain production inventory model with a supplier, a manufacturer, and a retailer. Supplier produces raw material and sent it to manufacturer on continuous basis. But the manufacturer produces items which is not only of imperfect quality item but also have inspection error by classifying a non defective item as defective or classifying a defective item as non-defective during supplies to retailer. Thus the retailer received perfect and imperfect item. The retailer once again inspects the received items and detects the defective item. The retailer makes three different strategies to manage the defective items. Also the retailer have considered a price and stock dependent stochastic demand, where it has considered the effect of deterioration, shortages, backordered. In this paper we have optimized the integrated total cost with respect to production rate of manufacturer and the time when the item finished at retailer end. Numerical simulation is presented to provide important managerial insights and demonstrated the model numerically.","['Shilpi Pal', 'G. S.

1265,"Full-duplex (FD) communications with simultaneous transmission and reception on the same carrier have long been deemed a promising way to boost spectrum efficiency, but hindered by the techniques for self-interference cancellation (SIC). Recent breakthroughs in analog and digital signal processing yield the feasibility of over 100 dB SIC capability, and make it possible for FD communications to demonstrate nearly doubled spectrum efficiency for pointto- point links. Now it is time to shift at least partially our focus to FD networking, such as in cellular networks. FD networking has more complicated interference environments. Therefore, its performance improvement is not that straightforward compared with half-duplex networking. Before putting FD networking into practice, we need to understand to which scenarios FD communications should be applied under the current technology maturity, how bad the performance will be if we do nothing to deal with the newly introduced interference, and most importantly, how much improvement could be achieved after applying advanced interference management solutions. We will discuss all these questions in this article. In particular, we will investigate advanced interference management solutions, including power control and user scheduling, and show that up to 91 percent spectrum efficiency gain and 110 percent energy efficiency gain of FD cellular networks over its HD counterpart can be achieved by applying these solutions.","['Rongpeng Li', 'Yan Chen', 'Geoffrey Ye Li', 'Guangyi Liu']",c766607a-e9f1-49de-bafc-d157e4d8992c,50,"['37173c41-07d9-42b2-bf20-9323720af5fd', '3b605293-024f-47fe-8863-84be391a7f50', '441113a4-8c3f-4c75-9c1b-2dda54c1cffe', '805d394d-460b-4405-909a-7ad6bd3b5ea2', 'a2eb51ad-8c55-4990-9438-74cd7ef23842', 'a6b907b8-d551-4032-a27f-660db9f85119', 'bdf2f3f4-97ea-4e7e-8974-fdfdd58ee609', 'd70babbd-ab0a-4016-ab75-17c99b3c0db7', 'efc8b546-3193-4dc7-ba39-ed83c3814090', 'f664730d-98eb-4a7e-95f1-aacd788fe2d7']",Full-Duplex Cellular Networks,IEEE Communications Magazine,2017
1266,"Design of personalized targeted therapies involve modeling of patient sensitivity to various drugs and drug combinations. Majority of studies evaluate the sensitivity of tumor cells to targeted drugs without modeling the effect of the drugs on normal cells. In this article, we consider the individual modeling of drug responses to tumor and normal cells and utilize them to design targeted combination therapies that maximize sensitivity over tumor cells and minimize toxicity over normal cells. The problem is formulated as maximizing sensitivity over tumor cell models while maintaining sensitivity below a threshold over normal cell models. We utilize the constrained structure of tumor proliferation models to design an accelerated lexicographic search algorithm for generating the optimal solution. For comparison purposes, we also designed two suboptimal search algorithms based on evolutionary algorithms and hill-climbing based techniques. Results over synthetic models and models generated from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database shows the ability of the proposed algorithms to arrive at optimal or close to optimal solutions in significantly lower number of steps as compared to exhaustive search. We also present the theoretical analysis of the expected number of comparisons required for the proposed Lexicographic search that compare favorably with the observed number of computations. The proposed algorithms provide a framework for design of combination therapy that tackles tumor heterogeneity while satisfying toxicity constraints.","['Kevin Matlock', 'Noah Berlow', 'Charles Keller', 'Ranadip Pal']",8be9b93e-b769-4f32-86d8-dcb972aba81a,50,"['09cc7b92-dbf4-4858-83e2-d5b527ddbf91', '12248b79-e9b5-4b05-a538-2ed2938f226c', '29a621e1-3030-4ef2-b053-065d5444e972', '342c2b12-d723-4241-b54f-b8cb09e9f498', 'a853c13f-7e54-417f-b21c-e82fd0eb5551', 'b57b14f4-e0e5-4616-9f3e-b20936c6f083', 'be5f68f8-d77b-49e1-b77c-c551913152a3', 'c6578f44-a0a2-4aff-85f6-00ee3b75f518']",Combination therapy design for maximizing sensitivity and minimizing toxicity,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
1267,"Finite impulse response (FIR) filters have been widely used in many digital signal processing applications because of their interesting properties such as phase linearity, bounded-input-bounded-output (BIBO) stability and easy implementation. However, the implementation of high order filters requires many multipliers. Several authors have proposed new methods such as multiple constant multiplication (MCM), distributed arithmetic (DA) and signed-powers-of-two (SPT) to avoid the use of multipliers by using the minimum number of registers. Nevertheless, the implementation of these strategies generates critical paths that limit their performance. In this work, we propose a compact hardware architecture to compute FIR filters at high processing speeds using new parallel neural multipliers. The scalability of the system enables the construction of many neural multiplier units for higher order FIR filters. To validate the proposal, the hardware architecture was implemented on the Kintex-7 field programmable gate array (FPGA) development kit. The results demonstrate that this new approach can be interfaced with the conventional binary systems to improve advanced signal processing applications such as high quality media contents, wireless communication and biomedical systems.","['Carlos Diaz', 'Giovanny Sanchez', 'Juan-Gerardo Avalos', 'Gabriel Sánchez', 'Juan-Carlos Sanchez', 'Hector Perez']",d7667ace-7667-49cf-8e87-39f8347811d7,0,"['05d87e9c-c067-41fa-8f4d-b2be26b99e18', '3c2168c6-3ce3-41f3-941e-8ae775b65a8b', '3e9e162b-e4a7-4afd-9374-a7de8bf94711', '4c87a31f-4363-488e-bdbf-875ae51f9e39', '4df482b5-b90a-4d17-94f2-897e780aeff8', '84c84291-d4cb-48ca-9666-9e8f18de9dc9', 'a33814a3-6be8-4f7b-b5f1-acb01b4e08d2', 'fd41ef1e-5fc8-4d11-8425-c92cf2f8c204']",Spike-based compact digital neuromorphic architecture for efficient implementation of high order FIR filters,Neurocomputing,2017
1268,"The popularity of many social media sites has prompted both academic and practical research on the possibility of mining social media data for the analysis of public sentiment. Studies have suggested that public emotions shown through Twitter could be well correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, it remains unclear how public sentiment, as reflected on social media, can be used to predict stock price movement of a particular publicly-listed company. In this study, we attempt to fill this research void by proposing a technique, called SMeDA-SA, to mine Twitter data for sentiment analysis and then predict the stock movement of specific listed companies. For the purpose of experimentation, we collected 200 million tweets that mentioned one or more of 30 companies that were listed in NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. SMeDA-SA performs its task by first extracting ambiguous textual messages from these tweets to create a list of words that reflects public sentiment. SMeDA-SA then made use of a data mining algorithm to expand the word list by adding emotional phrases so as to better classify sentiments in the tweets. With SMeDA-SA, we discover that the stock movement of many companies can be predicted rather accurately with an average accuracy over 70%. This paper describes how SMeDA-SA can be used to mine social media date for sentiments. It also presents the key implications of our study.","['Bing Li', 'Keith C. C.

1269,"The innovation literature often argues that major inventions arise through the cumulative synthesis of existing components and principles. An important economic phenomenon associated with this argument is the knowledge spillover. Although increasing attention has been paid to knowledge spillovers as a means to grasp innovation, little is known about its structural characteristics. This study examines the structural patterns of knowledge flow evidenced in patent citations by focusing on two aspects: the reciprocity of citations between technology sectors and the concentration of citing and cited sectors. The results indicate that the knowledge flow tends to be highly reciprocal within pairs of technology sectors instead of having a clear direction and that there are relatively low inflow and outflow concentrations in most sectors, although there are some exceptions. These results suggest that most technological sectors become both a knowledge provider and a knowledge consumer at the same time and they coevolve with reciprocal knowledge exchanges with each other.",['Wonchang Hur'],f46c797e-9f7d-4e3b-b959-cde805a6381b,0,"['34186340-a7e1-46a5-be06-8ea35c8db970', '46d6eece-0327-44a6-8862-7fa4ba5dad1a', 'c34a21a6-6649-4ffc-a518-3af002230d5a', 'c89f118a-9f38-45ac-8602-a9e503708b36']",The patterns of knowledge spillovers across technology sectors evidenced in patent citation networks,Scientometrics,2017

We obtain 22 clusters of documents from the giant component of the network that we interpret as constituting ‘topics’ in the field of astrophysics. Upon investigation of the content of the topics we find a grouping of topics by shared features of their ‘journal signature’, that is the journals that are most characteristic for a topic due to their popularity and distinctiveness.

1275,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the way we live and work by increasing the connectedness of people and things on a scale that was once unimaginable. However, the vulnerabilities in the IoT supply chain have raised serious concerns about the security and trustworthiness of IoT devices and components within them. Testing for device provenance, detection of counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) and systems, and traceability of IoT devices are challenging issues to address. In this article, we develop a novel radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based system suitable for counterfeit detection, traceability, and authentication in the IoT supply chain called  CDTA . CDTA is composed of different types of on-chip sensors and in-system structures that collect necessary information to detect multiple counterfeit IC types (recycled, cloned, etc.), track and trace IoT devices, and verify the overall system authenticity. Central to CDTA is an RFID tag employed as storage and a channel to read the information from different types of chips on the printed circuit board (PCB) in both power-on and power-off scenarios. CDTA sensor data can also be sent to the remote server for authentication via an encrypted Ethernet channel when the IoT device is deployed in the field. A novel board ID generator is implemented by combining outputs of physical unclonable functions (PUFs) embedded in the RFID tag and different chips on the PCB. A light-weight RFID protocol is proposed to enable mutual authentication between RFID readers and tags. We also implement a secure interchip communication on the PCB. Simulations and experimental results using Spartan 3E FPGAs demonstrate the effectiveness of this system. The efficiency of the radio-frequency (RF) communication has also been verified via a PCB prototype with a printed slot antenna.","['Kun Yang', 'Domenic Forte', 'Mark Tehranipoor']",33d3a47d-52f9-43cf-aae9-65a855b1390c,0,"['037b45b2-fd40-43cc-975e-22194039ccd1', '03bc84f8-47c3-4162-ba6b-1e338399041f', '047084da-1175-4614-b4ee-4ef56c1f3999', '074de4a1-d4ae-41f8-9719-8a65c29f1ee3', '10cca002-0a6e-45e7-866b-829607fc5854', '12435f18-609b-4d4d-9e95-553b4be2b405', '1a7b2f71-54da-4fc2-b78b-18a63b303a92', '2a0b4187-f250-4dc5-8d04-2fac7209b9e3', '2e963e83-48d7-4d7f-857b-183fc2c6d4c7', '30757767-1b2e-4d50-b335-868ad20fdccf', '335b39ed-cb8c-4ea3-9728-74b53f59491b', '3738cf1d-2184-4ee9-b4f2-ae73080cd405', '3d291272-9c7d-4754-823b-029afdcd288c', '40c3fb7a-45b7-48b7-af5c-bbb547e0bde5', '455c5ede-0d5a-4be9-adbd-5c2fe7a9ec66', '46d3d79d-d7b6-4c88-bfa7-ad5d85332b48', '4879be69-7cd4-4da2-a250-81aa7115e8fe', '4dff0b06-dc4d-45e9-addc-4f706ef583be', '532ff889-3443-4ca7-8daa-c4d0fb53269a', '54818809-3a5f-4265-8490-7552587a297a', '54de1a19-14ea-4481-84da-14eaf2086bb2', '5f6a94e8-e9a4-467d-819e-b34358bae915', '6056a0d6-b35f-4a7a-a0c9-47502b0907bc', '65ccd26b-2776-4d1d-968f-720cfec6cc98', '80da49f4-1bfd-4a55-87be-f4a0b16bea8d', '835ed464-8e1a-41b0-8d54-9b4f9190ce75', '864ddfb1-4b8a-44bd-8ad7-7a6b2d37b7d6', '8bf23cb2-b9f5-4d4c-8a47-fbadfcc5c998', 'a3dc5ddc-2bd4-4f05-b162-4b38dba94db5', 'a40cacb5-5e56-4d96-aeaa-453e43fb238d', 'a4a3a18a-54f2-4382-9199-ef9f83cb2574', 'b0d8db4e-53bc-413f-9296-9375d89b34bd', 'b2543ffa-d413-43bc-a169-bef7d2e83370', 'bb8860c1-b707-4409-a912-f33128ff5391', 'be5269e5-3cd4-4919-80d0-f5187e5986c3', 'becef5fb-9f3d-4696-8f72-fe8e7e357ff8', 'c1b534aa-1c37-42ad-895f-4f2a5422af4e', 'c20ab59a-9f5d-4af4-8c86-ca307c1e4916', 'c922349d-2319-459e-81c0-db257a63dd9c', 'cc69e534-07d0-47ee-ab7e-64f8ad03cf8f', 'cf328dbb-6dbd-4ae2-b0bc-197356461b8a', 'd348756b-f9df-40f3-a9e9-8f7bfb0f164b', 'd64a0ccc-0104-40e9-8273-51e4d0a89f34', 'd8375d5d-e20b-4390-bb32-7987261592d7', 'db3a5dda-2f67-456f-9b00-6c01de6f5a06', 'e1d7b7ab-ac25-410e-9ef5-60c8ff879825', 'f283ef37-9fb6-4bf7-9ac7-6064c4be2ac4', 'f4d01e26-2e6c-4e28-a143-e5a75e9f9fe8', 'f865b98a-1c26-44e9-a96e-c175ba83457f', 'f91ef229-19b7-4387-bff7-21f7448d7219', 'fbd64f11-cc5b-470a-97b9-2cb2615e7b8b', 'ffe1450e-9a0c-46c4-88ca-77650c56ecfb']","CDTA: A Comprehensive Solution for Counterfeit Detection, Traceability, and Authentication in the IoT Supply Chain",ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,2017
1276,"ABSTRACTUrban land use information plays an important role in urban management, government policy-making, and population activity monitoring. However, the accurate classification of urban functional zones is challenging due to the complexity of urban systems. Many studies have focused on urban land use classification by considering features that are extracted from either high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images or social media data, but few studies consider both features due to the lack of available models. In our study, we propose a novel scene classification framework to identify dominant urban land use type at the level of traffic analysis zone by integrating probabilistic topic models and support vector machine. A land use word dictionary inside the framework was built by fusing natural–physical features from HSR images and socioeconomic semantic features from multisource social media data. In addition to comparing with manual interpretation data, we designed several experiments to test the...","['Xiaoping Liu', 'Jialv He', 'Yao Yao', 'Jinbao Zhang', 'Haolin Liang', 'Huan Wang', 'Ye Hong']",c00e9742-b54f-451a-99fe-f62c1638aadc,0,"['00bd6961-8651-44d6-aaa7-89327ebe5425', '0574ca99-364c-4878-812b-4dc0ddd23593', '0ba443df-056e-42ce-b8b6-08695737dff2', '0d8e176f-2fc3-475f-ac3b-fc47fbb8f4d7', '11bcb14f-17db-48c8-ab27-d114ef95f06b', '13fd5d7c-6b82-4ade-b9e6-eccfd9abafa2', '164ab5ba-ba3c-451f-9ae6-8796d36b0e0e', '17bf6015-d2ed-4d44-9305-cc632d014946', '2015c48e-ad5f-437b-b8d3-7403878c2c93', '24bdefe8-0f06-4f4d-8685-db9070d9307a', '3011aefb-cce5-4853-9e30-9a9943ea83b6', '34406018-1e48-4eae-b2b9-69386c29bb7c', '377a26fa-dd8b-4bb2-9f16-8ec9d44dde6b', '393a41bb-f098-4825-90a7-06378ba58905', '40837514-ea94-47d8-ad79-e03c4de2be2b', '4d648fcc-cb37-466d-ae00-10527859d426', '5c549016-4b45-460c-8f50-987a7dedffd1', '6d415da2-27a6-4cc3-9d62-8b276fa23484', '756cf038-43bc-4103-bd21-1eb761138bb6', '7577f5ef-5e1d-45ac-aae8-42b906642b57', '7ee711f2-b31d-45dd-b966-330dc86b5504', '870c1a2f-41a7-45f9-a9bd-3c101ca31953', 'a0c405df-ca85-45ed-9f0e-b8f25ce1d8a5', 'a0ea5ce4-aedd-4e6c-a2d8-4ac7e9fe993a', 'a29e6628-02fa-43bc-b93c-6c886a653b96', 'a371092e-7575-4748-bc05-fe40d79df770', 'a709255d-1108-4991-8789-a8e2f3fda4a3', 'ab3afb93-8ca0-4556-ae60-11199dc263c2', 'b262b7bc-e6a6-4aa2-a766-57ebaaa82f7c', 'bd833b85-6c18-48b4-80ea-cccaa566271d', 'c0492d88-38e1-4d05-b4c1-1ab4d47b070b', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'c3682813-b709-41a9-8943-79a4d170d0f0', 'c4b17870-1651-4cfe-b853-a313264749a7', 'c87c959d-5a15-42cd-9fba-e1929d9bbaa6', 'ca75098f-076d-4af6-afca-580f353f1ee3', 'cba57a81-983a-480e-b33d-17b11133a50b', 'cd7e7bd5-d010-4571-80e5-48823cdfc079', 'd9417d32-0589-428d-a963-c12692487fc1', 'dd1196a0-50a1-4c41-89d4-5c63bfa1231b', 'df095c31-4b9b-4b01-b932-6259edd7f7a9', 'f0cb8dab-50e5-4f93-a7b6-b6aab05aba96', 'f579ce66-7ca7-4814-8802-acc2a14476fa']",Classifying urban land use by integrating remote sensing and social media data,International Journal of Geographical Information Science,2017
1277,"The dynamics of a system of hard spheres enclosed between two parallel plates separated a distance smaller than two particle diameters is described at the level of kinetic theory. The interest focuses on the behavior of the quasi-two-dimensional fluid seen when looking at the system from above or below. In the first part, a collisional model for the effective two-dimensional dynamics is analyzed. Although it is able to describe quite well the homogeneous evolution observed in the experiments, it is shown that it fails to predict the existence of non-equilibrium phase transitions, and in particular, the bimodal regime exhibited by the real system. A critical revision analysis of the model is presented , and as a starting point to get a more accurate description, the Boltzmann equation for the quasi-two-dimensional gas has been derived. In the elastic case, the solutions of the equation verify an H-theorem implying a monotonic tendency to a non-uniform steady state. As an example of application of the kinetic equation, here the evolution equations for the vertical and horizontal temperatures of the system are derived in the homogeneous approximation, and the results compared with molecular dynamics simulation results.","['José Javier Brey', 'V.

However, insights generated by these predictive models may not be suitable for pedagogically informed interventions due to the inability to explain why students display these behavioral patterns. Therefore, this study aims at providing explanations of students’ behaviors on LMS by incorporating dispositional dimensions (e.g., self-regulation and emotions) into conventional learning analytics models. Using a combination of demographic, trace, and self-reported data of eight contemporary social-cognitive theories of education from 1,069 students in a blended introductory quantitative course, we demonstrate the potential of dispositional characteristics of students, such as procrastination and boredom. Our results highlight the need to move beyond simple engagement metrics, whereby dispositional learning analytics provide an actionable bridge between learning analytics and educational intervention.","['Dirk Tempelaar', 'Bart Rienties', 'Quan Nguyen']",fea32422-1de3-494b-a39f-34498b9cfb69,50,"['93341fde-26cf-4b89-ac67-64cfb04f44af', 'a617ea08-8cc6-4362-ae4f-a685845ba381', 'aae16cf7-6ccc-458d-b113-04e4f82ca475', 'c0db943e-8799-43ec-8d56-da535e863dd0', 'c95a052c-309f-4e05-8d1a-80f928928a1e', 'e7d01838-29e4-4ca8-a34e-44cc126d1975']",Towards Actionable Learning Analytics Using Dispositions,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,2017
1279,"The Compressive sensing (CS) theory provides a novel type of image reconstruction methods for radar imaging. A good image can be obtained using much less data as compared to the conventional imaging methods, however under the sparse assumptions of the scene/target in certain domains. In this paper, we present a Kalman filter based sparse reconstruction approach for ISAR imaging. As the Kalman filter has robust and excellent estimation performance in statistical settings for linear problems, it leads to good image reconstruction results for real ISAR data. In addition to the spatial sparsity of the scene, we exploit the sparsity in wavelet domain to improve the reconstruction of region-like features in the target image other than point-like features. The images obtained by assuming the sparsity in different domains are synthesized to further improve the image reconstruction. The ISAR real data processing demonstrates the performance of the Kalman filter based sparse ISAR imaging method and the effectiveness of the image synthesis methods.","['Ling Wang', 'Otmar Loffeld', 'Kaili Ma', 'Yulei Qian']",4a4be711-6329-4276-a63f-4558adeb8e6a,0,"['1087dc66-edc0-472e-b7b1-26f1eb44917a', '136d5f00-604e-4759-891b-a974cfd1367d', '14bb249d-a832-4cb0-a194-54358d85a471', '1a3d2ac0-775e-47b7-8b9e-849a2d5bf27b', '2337afdd-33ba-49d0-a67e-4e79c1a1d3b4', '35b5e43d-8b26-4d47-b7ea-7a4b4a5840ad', '57907362-e301-4799-91ff-9818579883bd', '5dc83252-c6f5-44c6-8ad9-89c59f682026', '79594938-96bc-4854-b4ba-9e2888553af3', '86e0142a-7206-4fc2-a6d6-34520800e902', 'aeb7e79a-a0f2-41aa-a3d0-9dc6acecdce4', 'c2895d5b-d1cd-491e-984f-3489b312377b', 'e696c50b-f543-4b9c-94b9-20df039e484e', 'ee22044b-7f02-40f5-a0f5-1af126208b0b', 'f47a7832-967c-47ec-932c-fc2b27b1de44', 'f56b877b-4060-4754-b303-e8140968544c', 'f5c90c16-b750-4dc3-a192-d092b43c17c3']",Sparse ISAR imaging using a greedy Kalman filtering approach,Signal Processing,2017
1280,"Nowadays, multi-source image acquisition attracts an increasing interest in many fields, such as multi-modal medical image segmentation. Such acquisition aims at considering complementary information to perform image segmentation, since the same scene has been observed by various types of images. However, strong dependence often exists between multi-source images. This dependence should be taken into account when we try to extract joint information for precisely making a decision. In order to statistically model this dependence between multiple sources, we propose a novel multi-source fusion method based on the Gaussian copula. The proposed fusion model is integrated in a statistical framework with the hidden Markov field inference in order to delineate a target volume from multi-source images. Estimation of parameters of the models and segmentation of the images are jointly performed by an iterative algorithm based on Gibbs sampling. Experiments are performed on multi-sequence MRI to segment tumors.

In 1995, Aichholzer et al. proposed a definition of a  roof  over a simple polygon  P  in the  xy -plane as a terrain over  P  whose faces are supported by planes containing edges of  P    and making a dihedral angle   π/4     π  /  4        with the  xy -plane. This definition, however, allows roofs with faces isolated from the boundary of  P  and local minimum edges inducing pools of rainwater. Very recently, Ahn et al. introduced “realistic roofs” over a rectilinear polygon with  n  vertices by imposing two additional constraints under which no isolated faces and no local minimum vertices are allowed. Their definition is, however, restricted and excludes a number of roofs with no local minimum edges. In this paper, we propose a new definition of realistic roofs over a rectilinear polygon that corresponds to the class of roofs without isolated faces and local minimum edges. We investigate the geometric and combinatorial properties of realistic roofs and show that the maximum possible number of distinct realistic roofs over a rectilinear  n   -gon is at most              1.3211    m     (     m       ⌊  m  /  2  ⌋      )        , where   m=(n−4)/2     m  =  (  n  −  4  )  /  2       . We also present two algorithms that generate all realistic roofs.","['Sang Duk Yoon', 'Hee-Kap Ahn', 'Jessica Sherette']",05debb4c-fc39-4c25-9342-17f196d525ee,0,"['39be7972-c0f0-4dd3-b24a-e453e85a5952', '50615635-0ae9-4575-ab6a-e4797908d3b7', '63fd8e7f-12a4-4620-bfed-253454df6ec4', '78469aa9-4fa4-479e-a175-fb5f698d39ef', 'ab77784a-6315-4bd1-a851-d10d43ad314e', 'cebd2cf9-66e0-4650-a729-e431efb47c2a', 'f0571692-0347-4539-9d01-1e86d2ea2c04']",Realistic roofs without local minimum edges over a rectilinear polygon,Theoretical Computer Science,2017
1282,"Safety integrity level (SIL) verification is a critical step in safety lifecycle of safety-related systems (SRS). Introducing redundancy into SRS raises two issues: voting group configuration and common cause failures (CCF). In order to minimize CCF, diverse redundancy is widely adopted by SRS. However, in the past, almost all attention of SIL verification has been paid to identical redundancy, this is reflected in IEC 61508, ISA-TR84.00.02 and scientific literatures. Therefore, a novel method for SIL verification of SRS with diverse redundancy based on system degradation is proposed. Key idea of the method is to calculate average probability of dangerous failure on demand (PFDG) at each stage of system degradation, which is caused by failures of redundant channels. To validate proposed method, it has been applied on safety shutdown system of Nuclear Power Control Test Facility, and numerical result is compared with FTA and FRANTIC model. Sensitivity studies and comparison of numerical results indicate that the method has very good consistency with FTA and FRANTIC model. Moreover, two sets of general formulae for PFDG of any MooN(D) group with diverse redundancy are provided. From engineering practice point of view, it makes SIL verification process simpler.","['Long Ding', 'Hong Wang', 'Jin Jiang', 'Aidong Xu']",20871a0e-bd34-427a-8b8d-2bc380933d18,0,"['0d7d60ae-badc-4f74-96eb-adf6e0f8691d', '248c4bac-36ce-49f7-990c-8813e10527b6', '2d7cbcf1-9c27-46dd-b059-5dd30a659587', '48bce9cb-e8d2-4cbe-8f98-87eaae598254', '50d7e885-25df-4cd5-b536-0d98b5309270', '57963df1-f6d8-46a3-9426-4f0ef27e1b8a', '6729f670-e5ed-4f05-abd0-9c01f7897585', '6e4da42f-f418-4aef-9ebd-74ab70a376e2', '98396a04-dad9-4313-95ef-34f6f2d66ae0', '9ee22f65-520a-42d8-9c6f-38518a3c95a3', 'b70797a5-b0f9-4384-a0ab-e5d3baa0b3dd', 'b83b2a16-24b9-4a29-a0b7-fcdb152ebe47', 'e93f9629-eb9d-4cf6-a1c1-aa807b3c5f01', 'f3e41257-82a5-4e32-942c-65248c3f1b1e', 'fbd7f4ff-e08a-4a5e-9c3c-15405177c953']",SIL verification for SRS with diverse redundancy based on system degradation using reliability block diagram,Reliability Engineering & System Safety,2017
1283,"In this paper, we propose an online hashing tracking method with a further exploitation of spatio-temporal saliency for template sampling. Specifically, spatio-temporal saliency is firstly explored to make the sampled templates contain true object templates as much as possible. Then, different from the previous batch modes for hashing, the hashing function in this work is online learned by new pairs of collected templates received sequentially, in which the relationship between the positive templates and negative templates can be appropriately preserved that is more useful for visual tracking. With the hash coding for templates, the between-frame matching can be efficiently conducted. Besides, this work further builds a positive template pool as a memory buffer for object depiction, in which representative truly positive target templates are gathered and utilized to restrain the degradation of the appearance model due to the error accommodation in online hashing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker performs favorably against the state-of-the-art ones.","['Jianwu Fang', 'Hongke Xu', 'Qi Wang', 'Tianjun Wu']",31bfe923-df0c-4bf5-b353-ffa335073611,0,"['02ffa8c5-604e-4c30-b9b0-aec1f4529af4', '07d5fa97-2ede-4d4d-89ad-89260422ee18', '08cf9ba0-4c69-4595-823c-157b67c71658', '0ae61c32-f756-46b3-8932-b40313e48939', '1b93b265-b667-496f-b70e-fa4ceee67eb3', '225f0a5d-ee99-459e-92a2-c8c0dd745c75', '2a3a6115-439a-48bf-9154-6175c0e0fe0b', '2da611f5-a2aa-4a84-b969-5faebf1e08e3', '2eb05030-f1cd-46e6-9a12-50002839f809', '35a17a81-9661-475c-a23a-04f9b22f4605', '37cfc6b7-ab29-4c73-b177-45bfed01d5e3', '37fb7b96-9631-479d-b295-9538c7419da0', '4a379b0d-bc36-4b62-bdb1-40e4592e326a', '4ad8b6d3-5ee6-42ef-b3c7-d6d2846d5470', '4af31e75-4a69-4114-8706-7eec9e25345e', '4cafba1b-d046-4fc5-a427-c4a54410d1a1', '4ce44c95-f405-483c-8231-1d77e505ac6c', '55709fac-e4b6-4550-bd85-f57c131d24c5', '559254b5-548f-44fa-9a0c-7bee84f2c2d7', '563b6a1c-744f-45b8-885f-b15eb7afc31b', '5a7c9d23-6d10-431b-92af-541e4bbb86e3', '5fa02a95-51ad-4cca-83b0-1e55187ecea7', '6832a71b-21e1-4efb-b501-a5e768861db7', '6abe86b8-7222-4048-8e7d-9a8d70cffcd0', '6cb5b54d-25f0-4762-a3a8-09e975eae051', '6d4bd281-c999-4ab8-acbc-d64d15d7fe5b', '739b1ef7-73da-4f82-ac37-353e592e830f', '79e630a8-816e-4afb-b024-1db7b031bdff', '81d66e46-7612-4aba-8318-33c4e7e57674', '88fda829-49e9-4712-b964-b252ce58a53e', '8900f463-be02-49eb-a20d-f5b32f20877b', '8f23b7fd-98d9-4358-a82a-88cf09a1fed8', '910a223b-1f53-4100-a600-6cce47c85f1d', '9175053a-0887-4de2-9244-2f3235914017', '91d33441-0fbe-4294-b7a8-6e93e31cb57e', '979e67fb-e5fe-4656-a496-c9bb1dc83eaa', '9b771cb4-8c38-4ce2-9fe3-36eca550b260', 'a69bd540-019c-4cb0-aacc-62abebc5810d', 'b11d4437-4a29-425a-867e-70414655a7a4', 'b31bfb84-4f53-4edd-aabb-5cec58047c74', 'b4553503-27a7-4b19-b434-7650aee99117', 'bc9d9aee-be96-44a1-b36e-4c4421f06d9d', 'be667b75-0313-4427-b0ea-a68c56ebb598', 'c5e509f1-51c9-4964-9242-491283fca091', 'c7a8267c-ff6b-46bf-b54a-1baccd3e830e', 'c8026bc4-1e05-418b-a0a4-9ccb3c72b9de', 'c820e0ca-c763-4604-910f-d5febbc1beba', 'cab7d992-0582-468c-b3d1-cc5800f911a7', 'd581c7a0-ee5b-42c8-acba-65f4aca68f47', 'd87f6ae6-462a-4d4f-b175-80f8698e7d85', 'd8fcb057-9de3-4ac1-a33c-c6c05f2d359d', 'dda32e99-40c9-4d5f-8982-51e4b1dca885', 'dee52dac-0991-40b3-89b5-d4269b993980', 'e7c04cdc-ed81-4744-8a11-526d9ea66ac1', 'e9f78f96-a340-48c3-bd5c-c53b31e92dbf', 'f51869d5-2777-4539-863b-6828684cf5b5', 'f6bdef02-02af-4ce4-879e-87ffb9dc0961', 'f9de4ef6-3639-4d70-9e8f-ddae25f45726', 'faae469e-68c1-415e-8ca9-400eb777f9f4', 'fd2aa9e3-63c5-446a-ab8c-06aba7699610', 'fd744726-ee23-4073-98c8-b7c2529eb2a2']",Online hash tracking with spatio-temporal saliency auxiliary,Computer Vision and Image Understanding,2017
1284,"Turn-taking is a preverbal skill whose mastering constitutes an important precondition for many social interactions and joint actions. However, the cognitive mechanisms supporting turn-taking abilities are still poorly understood. Here, we propose a computational analysis of turn-taking in terms of two general mechanisms supporting joint actions: action prediction (e.g., recognizing the interlocutor’s message and predicting the end of turn) and signaling (e.g., modifying one’s own speech to make it more predictable and discriminable). We test the hypothesis that in a simulated conversational scenario dyads using these two mechanisms can recognize the utterances of their co-actors faster, which in turn permits them to give and take turns more efficiently. Furthermore, we discuss how turn-taking dynamics depend on the fact that agents cannot simultaneously use their internal models for both action (or messages) prediction and production, as these have different requirements—or, in other words, they cannot speak and listen at the same time with the same level of accuracy. Our results provide a computational-level characterization of turn-taking in terms of cognitive mechanisms of action prediction and signaling that are shared across various interaction and joint action domains.","['Francesco Donnarumma', 'Haris Dindo', 'Pierpaolo Iodice', 'Giovanni Pezzulo']",4293eb58-6a53-4e31-a77c-d0e9d9f6ff46,0,"['0794f565-8cc5-4081-9e3a-f0f75fefe4b3', '090f20a9-9bd5-4413-84b9-59d6543bbfb9', '0a73059c-824d-4713-95d3-435abb840299', '1b6af591-1627-454d-ad98-b096217783b1', '1cb05ebf-a4e0-4929-ac9e-186b36e6f7ee', '1d9ed133-6f7e-4a81-86ca-945fd65b49ba', '311953e0-64b6-4c87-8beb-95fa47207f95', '364e8f63-2dc5-447e-91be-e4ecd8837176', '36970a9d-15a0-44de-8972-ccff581c3467', '4942b28a-07e0-42d0-a138-2089e001a2fa', '4a445b0e-9b31-4f8d-ba60-820f8f9f5daf', '512d0ad6-b6db-401f-baf4-6692da803e6e', '5ca109ee-2250-457b-9d32-0052d254d41d', '67efeb3a-56bb-4bd8-bc0b-dca8f84fa3d3', '737dd486-46a1-4008-86da-4691c4f276ef', '7cb7c4d0-19f8-4015-985e-700a44c735b7', '8c2f6d4f-a7c9-497a-8047-1de28fe09c51', 'a6500eb8-c1b4-4df2-aabf-3b95ffa8313c', 'a9ddd619-a81b-4ba0-a7d5-246fa1088c25', 'aa433a0e-0fa4-4c0d-9b3f-0aa03107a201', 'acc31a1c-d01d-456d-a0e1-71dbd6dcf036', 'b79f0e5c-215d-4d29-90e4-81f05bcd75cc', 'cd9c803f-82f3-408d-b910-d271fa0e70a9', 'd69620d4-090c-4008-9416-f6bd265e8051', 'e98bc1b5-a75e-4e1a-abe3-02802c1d071d']",You cannot speak and listen at the same time: a probabilistic model of turn-taking,Biological Cybernetics,2017

1287,"The roll-out of smart meters in electricity networks introduces risks for consumer privacy due to increased measurement frequency and granularity. Through various Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring techniques, consumer behavior may be inferred from their metering data. In this paper, we propose an energy management method that protects privacy through the minimization of information leakage. The method is based on a Model Predictive Controller that utilizes energy storage and local generation, and that predicts the effects of its actions on the statistics of the actual energy consumption of a consumer and that seen by the grid. Computationally, the method requires solving a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program of manageable size whenever new meter readings are available. We simulate the controller on generated residential load profiles with different privacy costs in a two-tier time-of-use energy pricing environment. Results show that information leakage is effectively reduced at the expense of increased energy cost. The results also show that, using the proposed controller, the consumer load profile seen by the grid resembles a mixture between that obtained with Non-Intrusive Load Leveling and Lazy Stepping.","['Jun-Xing Chin', 'Tomas Tinoco De Rubira', 'Gabriela Hug']",3b93f3b5-3bce-4e85-9dce-b04aeceb0623,50,"['130d22c5-40be-40fd-b607-46fd76896e3e', '4b5b2080-8de3-4276-864a-db55567b2700', '68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be', '85b2c918-e64f-4fcc-b230-0447b940ba1e', 'a1d89448-8238-4a42-9799-29ad595c4be1', 'bc634f48-54d8-4a41-b3e0-63d411a59b6a', 'cc126db8-758f-4e41-bf3a-599eff151e39', 'd197b5be-ee6f-4bea-a2cf-940f706f351c', 'd3d30744-2ed5-4eb2-b985-71b4da18e09f', 'd99af3be-7d72-403e-82ae-89ec64e66f1f']",Privacy-Protecting Energy Management Unit through Model-Distribution Predictive Control,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,2017
1288,"Robust optimization over time is a new approach to solving dynamic optimization problems. It aims to maximize the time within which a solution remains to be acceptable in a changing environment. Since switching solutions often incurs cost in many real-world applications, it is essential for decision makers to take into account the trade-off between robustness and the switching cost in deciding whether the solution currently in use should be switched to a new solution when an environmental change occurs. This paper proposes a generic multi-objective optimization framework for robust optimization over time that simultaneously maximizes the robustness and minimizes the switching cost. An instantiation of the framework is also implemented, where a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted as the optimizer and the cost for switching a solution is defined to be the difference in the decision space between the solution used in the previous environment and the one in the current environment. In addition, performance indicators are defined to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Empirical studies are carried out on a number of benchmark problems to analyze the influence of the parameters on the behavior of the algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to find trade-off solutions between the robustness over time and switching cost in a dynamic environment. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is analyzed in terms of the performance indicators, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework in minimizing the switching cost in dynamic environments.","['Yuanjun Huang', 'Yongsheng Ding', 'Kuangrong Hao', 'Yaochu Jin']",38a00dbf-d095-4f69-8f24-8f6c33f90c43,0,"['162170be-72c6-46ca-96af-149fa571b7d6', '209c22b5-ba58-4c66-9751-b0b62ed586da', '28103bcc-6775-4d28-ae8c-1af3091dd266', '35fa17b6-533d-422c-851c-10ce365402bb', '3bd35e1e-c48c-4a22-845c-f79e799d7c5d', '40b8d6d7-c127-4ac6-8d61-ae44a6e6f55a', '540af24d-e902-435a-9cd9-91315d14ebfc', '5e3e8eea-8e22-403b-8866-624ce3c2f8bf', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '6cc8c9bb-0b17-401e-bc56-a5a17851ee7b', '77492468-ca8e-47a3-9bb5-b29b70f6fad8', '8aa289e7-7bde-48ad-85cd-f87361c754f0', '8af32b05-dd2d-4a9c-b5d5-af7605525357', '963a5552-c196-45ae-abfb-7a3c0a241496', '9b619588-7135-47e9-9f5c-742af81a1cda', '9cd12c0b-d211-4450-8830-5ff5ce20db51', '9eeccefa-8f89-483e-9cc9-10fec6ec5d83', '9fe857f0-bb59-4bbc-bbbb-d3abccb97cd2', 'ab99f4e1-ab6c-4aad-82c9-6b3acf80d587', 'abdaaa58-823e-4e71-bb84-b9aa9a7eeb87', 'b151962b-07a3-4d25-a429-52fc8fb206a6', 'bef143e0-ed33-4b70-a526-9bb4845fa472', 'c9f4bc45-1e8d-49de-bceb-aebad6ba6e54', 'd7c40ff3-880f-4365-b091-37120378b009', 'e0ca2217-8280-43aa-9de5-b8a7e309ae2b', 'e64424da-5338-4a99-847b-1b342739d8a1', 'e8332566-2c21-42ed-b222-e6ce006909a6', 'eea967b6-4178-41d7-bdde-bd1ee33d290d']",A multi-objective approach to robust optimization over time considering switching cost,Information Sciences,2017

1290,"For parabolic PDEs with integer-order temporal derivative, if we use the Schwarz waveform relaxation (SWR) algorithm with Robin transmission conditions as the solver, the so-called equioscillation principle is an important concept to get a good Robin parameter, which has a significant effect on the convergence rate of the algorithm. Surprisingly, as we show in this paper such a principle may result in rather disappointing Robin parameter for the SWR algorithm when we use it to solve time-fractional PDEs. For a class of time-fractional diffusion equations, by analyzing a new min–max problem we get much better Robin parameter, which is found very close to the best one that we can make through numerical optimizations and numerical experiments. To use the SWR algorithm in practice, we apply the kernel reduction technique proposed recently by Baffet and Hesthaven to treat the convolutions with kernel function of the form \(\mathscr {K},_{\gamma },(t)=t^{-\gamma },/\varGamma (1-\gamma )\), where \(\gamma \in (0, 1)\). For time-fractional PDEs with this kind of kernel function, the kernel reduction technique results in efficient one-step numerical schemes. Numerical results obtained by using this technique confirm our theoretical conclusions very well.",['Shu-Lin Wu'],e449cf9e-59f7-4c03-af8b-67564a235093,0,"['037a7a32-3bf8-49d0-8901-2671b15b8505', '263dc45f-ca27-453b-b267-3e812a308625', '28b26d05-2405-4de6-8539-e1844887a60d', '44692f83-2da4-4965-999b-42f1677578f4', '4852c856-ac6e-44b3-aca9-004304cb9eed', '4e10f584-5b11-4b62-bacf-ecfd1fc5e1fe', '5358559a-97c5-4e28-a58d-044899310b02', '55501d46-fd0a-4031-bfef-8c653b73f4c8', '5a0a091f-adb8-4e16-9be2-1a110a9beea1', '62e83146-0b6d-41ed-8624-04fdd00f67de', 'a5865266-8a53-4281-8a6e-94dc8173f79f', 'b69a7049-d2a5-4d42-92f3-b25f1f8d017e', 'c01e53c1-beb5-409e-9cd8-493688c7aa26', 'd5821328-f8a6-4983-b2e2-d94dd5226c33', 'fac3c1b1-b724-44cd-8508-ab374c2eba8f']",Optimized Overlapping Schwarz Waveform Relaxation for a Class of Time-Fractional Diffusion Problems,Journal of Scientific Computing,2017
1291,"This letter describes modifications to locally normalized filter banks (LNFB), which substantially improve their performance on the Aurora-4 robust speech recognition task using a Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM)-based speech recognition system. The modified coefficients, referred to as LNFB features, are a filter-bank version of locally normalized cepstral coefficients (LNCC), which have been described previously. The ability of the LNFB features is enhanced through the use of newly proposed dynamic versions of them, which are developed using an approach that differs somewhat from the traditional development of delta and delta–delta features. Further enhancements are obtained through the use of mean normalization and mean–variance normalization, which is evaluated both on a per-speaker and a per-utterance basis. The best performing feature combination (typically LNFB combined with LNFB delta and delta–delta features and mean–variance normalization) provides an average relative reduction in word error rate of 11.4% and 9.4%, respectively, compared to comparable features derived from Mel filter banks when clean and multinoise training are used for the Aurora-4 evaluation. The results presented here suggest that the proposed technique is more robust to channel mismatches between training and testing data than MFCC-derived features and is more effective in dealing with channel diversity.","['Josué Fredes', 'José Novoa', 'Simon King', 'Richard M.

1292,"Iris recognition systems have demonstrated considerable improvement in recognizing people through their iris patterns. Recent iris recognition systems have focused on images acquired in unconstrained environments. Unconstrained imaging environments allow the capture of iris images at a distance, in motion and under visible wavelength illumination which lead to more noise factors such as off-focus, gaze deviation, and obstruction by eyelids, eyeglasses, hair, lighting and specular reflections. Segmenting irises taken in an unconstrained environment remains a challenging task for iris recognition. In this paper, a new iris segmentation method is developed and tested on UBIRIS.v2 and MICHE iris databases that reflect the challenges in recognition by unconstrained images. This method accurately localizes the iris by a model designed on the basis of the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor and Support Vector Machine (SVM), namely HOG-SVM. Based on this localization, iris texture is automatically extracted by means of a cellular automata which evolved via the GrowCut technique. Pre- and post-processing operations are also introduced to ensure higher segmentation accuracy. Extensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on unconstrained iris images.","['Abduljalil Radman', 'Nasharuddin Zainal', 'Shahrel Azmin Suandi']",1fe60956-3113-4063-8ab6-d20a369a26af,0,"['00cd6286-a7c9-4850-9687-3d3c56259558', '15265a26-9581-40ac-9148-98dd123af24a', '19e8a0f4-44a3-4142-a6f7-dc819d03941a', '29086172-8eea-4fd7-a991-733f7d5e6c13', '34b2fb27-2805-4b99-bc58-aa0b7bcec691', '3a615d6c-5bb9-4e9a-9c7f-ddc6ff02322e', '3cb6d198-9715-4c3a-9c0c-ff3b5131f73e', '400d3614-c669-495d-a3d0-9df47152610b', '432c98f2-9e3e-43d8-b4c7-2a95a5523cf8', '44068e79-df73-4cbe-92f6-c43cff5d2f99', '4df1c3e1-21ca-49b5-ae95-66f2cf36f274', '50980c00-34b3-4ee4-9441-1eca0d6f162b', '54c891ea-4ddf-4715-804c-4c644ac7a2de', '565d3903-ed76-48d5-9eaa-9057a84d2bdc', '5cb54cda-edee-4d26-96b1-b7dc40a0fa0b', '638987bc-88ec-4f45-a400-e9e516f2575e', '68dafdea-6e3b-43e0-8435-d7d5c124ac50', '70352ae6-4d4d-45da-bcb2-07f76570b6fa', '78436454-caba-4dd5-a841-19a55e1b081a', '7f51ac70-d2aa-43d4-8fc1-6749a170f526', '8fa4d969-2777-484f-baff-8798ef35f2d3', '93351f78-1b4b-4a66-9489-db37265e2c8b', 'a0f2965f-2a34-4729-9a40-625e7bc76d91', 'af5b1876-2aea-4cd4-b67f-6dffe6a80ec7', 'b437cc84-edf6-401a-a36b-a9531cf24d4b', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'b9640d50-2532-4f4b-8127-f097b486f11b', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'd2a8c3e1-bc17-46e5-b600-1b6bfe79b42e', 'dd83785a-dd19-41e3-9b25-ebabbd48d336', 'df66c614-2cf9-4e05-8f1c-1921700dd5c5', 'e649a9fd-f6d9-4aac-b428-29b82c20a484', 'ee8e3e85-3ffd-4c43-b0cf-98ed4c755223', 'f388989c-70d0-4220-b27b-cbead4558865', 'f54cb8c2-d526-4160-9616-44923cd7c26c', 'ff6d02dd-ed63-4fe2-b4c0-2536b0baa451']",Automated segmentation of iris images acquired in an unconstrained environment using HOG-SVM and GrowCut,Digital Signal Processing,2017
1293,"Weighted Frequent Itemset Mining (WFIM) has been proposed as an extension of frequent itemset mining that considers not only the frequency of items but also their relative importance. However, using WFIM algorithms in real applications raises some problems. First, they do not consider how recent the patterns are. Second, traditional WFIM algorithms cannot handle uncertain data, although this type of data is common in real-life. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the concept of Recent High Expected Weighted Itemset (RHEWI), which considers the recency, weight and uncertainty of patterns. By considering these three factors, more up-to-date and relevant results are found. A projection-based algorithm named RHEWI-P is presented to mine RHEWIs using a novel  upper - bound downward closure  ( UBDC ) property. An improved version of this algorithm called RHEWI-PS is further proposed based on a novel  sorted upper-bound downward closure  ( SUBDC ) property for pruning unpromising candidate itemsets early. An experimental evaluation against the state-of-the-art HEWI-Uapriori algorithm was carried out on both real-world and synthetic datasets. Results show that the proposed algorithms are highly efficient and are acceptable for mining the desired patterns.","['Wensheng Gan', 'Jerry Chun-Wei Lin', 'Philippe Fournier-Viger', 'Han-Chieh Chao', 'Jimmy Ming-Thai Wu', 'Justin Zhan']",d7c85454-0c88-4b01-bfde-058e7acf533e,0,"['08f0eb0c-891c-41dd-89c0-abd9c541c768', '1012cd0d-9eaf-423b-875e-f82f94628434', '1f1ca202-7188-4399-b6e6-f1d9b87bf1be', '2b37d44d-c0eb-4da7-8c55-20c61bc064df', '32c06c20-e5c5-47bf-80d5-fdbfba0bb39e', '34b7e270-80d7-46d5-a6f1-e50087a8d045', '41d55ccf-89b3-47d6-a774-ddda782aef03', '42633d59-7cea-4ef4-89cf-41a289279925', '630d6d31-c21b-41b3-b932-44d6160443b2', '6bcb9bd6-2a1c-4173-bc96-20566ec47076', '718562ef-10d7-43a7-b958-cdcdca367151', '79269a5f-d985-4520-b069-02ef3aa54fa5', '7d672d68-2119-4284-bec4-bdcb12478690', '8303fca4-a1e4-4090-87b0-d464ac7aca88', '84a239b3-1d80-4520-8e76-face6ee0bded', '887b0fa5-330f-4a16-b942-e31ccb987629', '8bfd7499-28f0-4155-9610-d28725aba9f1', '9c2df6e5-b1f2-49b5-ba84-2e76a7d86cd1', '9e06cfe7-0178-4b1b-a7a5-5a6c89d6992c', 'a798d377-3e74-4ca3-b23e-d5c9fd94e775', 'a9764584-f538-4b79-88ce-2ab0d3d63044', 'ac1c1f38-5d5c-4628-864a-1c3cd628f695', 'b414cb63-93ae-4181-97f4-078fc85c1fc3', 'b6e413e8-3c3d-476b-bbac-9f9b563dba84', 'bfaf96e8-a3d0-4bb1-8be4-0856220f6d46', 'c4710c73-497d-44f0-ae10-64613eca18d4', 'd1c93534-82a5-41fa-a5fa-9d18f5c2577f', 'f6d4e32a-6233-4095-8454-0e3770cb6b5b', 'fd51a61f-256d-490b-8b9a-7a5ff10e1953', 'fe69dce1-ece7-42e3-b0bb-fe9c170cbde8']",Extracting recent weighted-based patterns from uncertain temporal databases,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2017
1294,"Quantitative morphometric analyses of form are widely used in palaeontology, especially for taxonomic and evolutionary research. These analyses can involve several measurements performed on hundreds or even thousands of samples. Performing measurements of size and shape on large assemblages of macro- or microfossil samples is generally infeasible or impossible with traditional instruments such as vernier calipers. Instead, digital image processing software is required to perform measurements via suitable digital images of samples. Many software packages exist for morphometric analyses but there is not much available for the integral stage of data collection, particularly for the measurement of the outlines of samples. Some software exists to automatically detect the outline of a fossil sample from a digital image. However, automatic outline detection methods may perform inadequately when samples have incomplete outlines or images contain poor contrast between the sample and staging background. Hence, a manual digitization approach may be the only option. We are not aware of any software packages that are designed specifically for efficient digital measurement of fossil assemblages with numerous samples, especially for the purposes of manual outline analysis. Throughout several previous studies, we have developed a new software tool, JMorph, that is custom-built for that task. JMorph provides the means to perform many different types of measurements, which we describe in this manuscript. We focus on JMorph's ability to rapidly and accurately digitize the outlines of fossils. JMorph is freely available from the authors.","['Peter G.

1295,"A subfamily  F′  of a set family  F  is said to  q - represent   F  if for every  A  ∈  F  and  B  of size  q  such that  A ∩ B  e ∅ there exists a set  A′  ∈  F′  such that  A′  ∩  B  e ∅. Recently, we provided an algorithm that, for a given family  F  of sets of size  p  together with an integer  q , efficiently computes a  q -representative family  F′  of  F  of size approximately (p+qap). In this article, we consider the efficient computation of  q -representative families for  product  families  F . A family  F  is a product family if there exist families  A  and  B  such that  F  e l  A , c ∅r. Our main technical contribution is an algorithm that, given  A ,  B  and  q , computes a  q -representative family  F′  of  F . The running time of our algorithm is  sublinear  in v F v for many choices of  A ,  B , and  q  that occur naturally in several dynamic programming algorithms. We also give an algorithm for the computation of  q -representative families for product families  F  in the more general setting where  q -representation also involves independence in a matroid in addition to disjointness. This algorithm considerably outperforms the naive approach where one first computes  F  from  A  and  B  and then computes the  q -representative family  F′  from  F .   We give two applications of our new algorithms for computing  q -representative families for product families.

1296,"In this paper, we study the problem of energy-efficient resource allocation in multiuser two-way amplify-and-forward (AF) relay networks with the aim of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE), while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and balancing the EE of the user links. We formulate an EE-balancing optimization problem that maximizes the ratio of the spectral efficiency (SE) over the total power dissipation subject to QoS and a limited transmit power constraints. The problem which maximizes the EE by jointly optimizing the subcarrier pairing, power allocation, and subcarrier allocation, turns out to be a non-convex fractional mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, which has an intractable complexity in general. We apply a concave lower bound on the achievable sum rate and a series of convex transformations to make the problem convex one and propose an iterative algorithm for iteratively tightening the lower bound and finding the optimal solution through dual decomposition approach. In addition, a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm is investigated. We then characterize the impact of various network parameters on the attainable EE and SE of the network employing both EE maximization and SE maximization algorithms when the network is designed from the EE perspective. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","['Keshav Singh', 'Ankit Gupta', 'Tharmalingam Ratnarajah']",58583960-caee-4e3e-9d27-e251b03b128f,0,"['0a90b6d2-c12a-49c3-bf03-3b1f3ba28966', '0d418efc-bd4b-431c-88d9-904da1b66f71', '0f6ee504-7ba9-486d-a034-8e311301698d', '1124396e-9f88-4b51-8820-bd435bab483c', '1348b2e6-9b31-4e1a-ade7-3872fa8a6f51', '184065fc-2e59-47b0-aaee-ade7ab8f417e', '38cf6f96-fd93-40ca-bdc8-10b317967852', '46af492d-5ee7-477c-ad11-1e96692c1d67', '4fde5982-025c-4060-ac4c-fa28af908713', '723c1edd-5d03-4d55-82f2-35ce74f73e96', '77b5708f-042c-48ed-a1e9-4bd5605e3148', '7a863321-8f71-45aa-8a75-bb5835dae558', '80d9479a-b1e4-418f-a546-2b2dfc0dde75', '82d1a758-a6f6-4cad-ae25-9c6ec0540db7', '951c88f2-7655-40d8-b6db-5ada53aa0e48', '984e2ac2-9c06-4027-8260-f2f26eb48133', '9c223647-3b5d-4c84-b97d-288732ca8bab', 'a2d703b0-76f4-45dd-9887-c5901a4e8738', 'a505cae1-f15f-4183-b7a9-519a890ba24b', 'a65ce1c8-3c4c-42ef-b289-a91751cabf6d', 'c3fdd0ca-97c4-4053-af7c-737202945ef7', 'db2f9b6e-1f6e-47b4-870d-4a3e3e392f59', 'e3e0072f-29cb-404f-b91f-24f1c3232a06', 'fcc0c8f1-5b88-4f6a-8aec-df8713f2c6d9']",QoS-Driven Resource Allocation and EE-Balancing for Multiuser Two-Way Amplify-and-Forward Relay Networks,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2017

This study investigates a novel application of correlated online searches in predicting stock performance across supply chain partners.

We identify publicly traded supply chain partners using Bloomberg data and construct cosearch networks of supply chain partners based on the weekly coviewing pattern of these firms on Yahoo! Finance.

1298,"Small multiples can visually enforce comparisons of changes or differences among objects, revealing potential patterns by providing different views. According to the analyzing requirements in food safety fields and characteristics of pesticide residue detection data, in this paper, we propose a novel visualization approach to explore and analyze the time-varying hierarchical data, which is called ordered small multiple treemaps (OSMT). Inspired by the thought of querying an array by rows or columns, OSMT makes it possible to locate a specific node in the treemap layout by using a unique location 2-tuple and keep a relative stable order of nodes in the layout while we detecting temporal patterns. This algorithm enables the visual representation of the node values varying with time, preserving the hierarchical relationships among nodes in the meanwhile. Based on some interaction techniques (filtering, selecting, highlighting and zooming, etc.), OSMT can help users find some specific changes more easily and thus make corresponding decisions with more efficiency. Besides, we also propose a new metric called TVA (Ability of tracking time-varying data in treemap) with a purpose of evaluating different kinds of treemap layout algorithms from the aspect of the difficulty level for tracking time-varying nodes in the overall layout. Finally, our technique’s applicability is demonstrated on the pesticide residues detection results dataset in this study.","['Yi Chen', 'Xiaomin Du', 'Xiaoru Yuan']",ed7fa07a-14b6-45de-9b06-81a6e7175f84,50,"['0bf00061-633e-40f5-a24e-de20a904ad9a', '0e44f915-de42-4fcf-a6dd-9b9fb48be83a', '165fc6f3-8d03-4fe5-816a-146f9cdb0191', '1c978621-3f02-42f1-9fcc-8cdbb69dd0b8', '2a3140bc-6c66-4540-a2a5-10f2f2b7a6f6', '2bce93f1-90c2-4952-a54b-16f6a7d85d1c', '2dca2f7c-858c-4bba-81a3-65cd1924992c', '38177c55-08fd-4027-a4f2-2d3fd63ce481', '383017e1-6fc9-4057-b2f7-9603bd4e76e2', '3a5fed12-fe6d-4594-9d7d-d749c9acfe14', '41f3e762-7cd7-4c86-9672-73fb93eaba2d', '43bfb04b-404a-4d8e-8367-6884e57bec6c', '4bbb5d47-6118-432f-b5c5-dfc5d2cd26fd', '4fd53718-aec4-4b41-9306-ebf952850b10', '57fb5c1a-31ba-4914-8606-cdf67d370934', '59dce142-f802-44d1-bd2d-23e6f17e8aa4', '6e08b504-c7ad-4042-998e-6cbf53c6a94d', '73e037db-849d-4724-ac90-efad6d717481', '75181067-d41b-4bdf-af71-4052552100a0', '7f352e16-ef9e-424d-bbaa-0fa5660119f5', '8272f293-a942-476b-955d-5d4f43872ee6', '9641b1f3-a4d5-4642-ae91-78d2b2613866', 'a6076efc-a62f-4156-b06d-cc5e6fdc6699', 'ab268b64-fac4-4947-9c11-8e3f9901b6b7', 'b3bece3a-fc83-4c28-9f9a-3f9dbcf40482', 'c40fdddc-fd9c-42ca-8289-6c2d22badbd7', 'ca50157c-4919-4a89-a7b2-42b3ea5521c0', 'cf14d59e-6451-484c-9764-b22dbb9e2243', 'd4d54575-1b31-4f13-892d-d985cf623df0', 'de02ab9c-6ae6-4faf-9857-af9206fbc7c4', 'f206937f-427f-47b0-9eac-48cb3c6abed3', 'f42151f7-528b-4f0f-b462-2918c68fd2ad', 'f7e41288-cf71-4f89-b36d-f3a2142c390e', 'fa584e89-4893-4b45-ad2c-29f9b3d6da77', 'fad4e3d7-7f9d-4198-81df-a9459162eee0']",Ordered small multiple treemaps for visualizing time-varying hierarchical pesticide residue data,The Visual Computer,2017

The current classroom experiment compared a popular commercial game for equation solving, DragonBox and a research-based ITS, Lynnette with respect to desirable educational outcomes. The 190 participating 7th and 8th grade students were randomly assigned to work with either system for 5 class periods. We measured out-of-system transfer of learning with a paper and pencil pre- and post-test of students’ equation-solving skill. We measured enjoyment and accuracy of self-assessment with a questionnaire. The students who used DragonBox solved many more problems and enjoyed the experience more, but the students who used Lynnette performed significantly better on the post-test. Our analysis of the design features of both systems suggests possible explanations and spurs ideas for how the strengths of the two systems might be combined.

1301,"Generating realistic and complex computational domains for numerical simulations is often a challenging task. In neuroscientific research, more and more one-dimensional morphology data is becoming publicly available through databases. This data, however, only contains point and diameter information not suitable for detailed three-dimensional simulations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, AnaMorph, that automatically generates water-tight surface meshes from one-dimensional point-diameter files. These surface triangulations can be used to simulate the electrical and biochemical behavior of the underlying cell. In addition to morphology generation, AnaMorph also performs quality control of the semi-automatically reconstructed cells coming from anatomical reconstructions. This toolset allows an extension from the classical dimension-reduced modeling and simulation of cellular processes to a full three-dimensional and morphology-including method, leading to novel structure-function interplay studies in the medical field. The developed numerical methods can further be employed in other areas where complex geometries are an essential component of numerical simulations.","['Konstantin Mörschel', 'Markus Breit', 'Gillian Queisser']",37a8f4c6-b8c2-4e90-a42c-93609875d6a5,0,"['27541fc2-6b9a-41c9-8e7d-089f8feda0a5', '34b5f68a-fa76-4c8b-a22e-12119348de5f', '3a461ccb-abcf-4712-849c-4a10762e313a', '442bac21-269c-4ef4-b8ac-ed891e8b0939', '47d9dda9-2359-46a0-ac58-2ed688f80fd7', '4ebec308-7a47-4fdf-acb7-7f4bb12dce10', '51ffa538-4462-44e8-a2f8-34191969ca38', '56b71248-7e42-4500-9182-9e9df791b7ac', '5b91692a-ad10-4055-bb7a-88b17da2215f', '7050f0fb-7af2-49aa-86e1-b4115342ee85', '9218dc04-9874-438b-99d6-f10874801146', '92b4e881-4c2a-4a48-8ccd-c1ef05c1a8ee', 'a312d728-98c6-4a53-b846-d7d889c2fd2a', 'a51185c3-92a6-4fa1-92d8-83682622e438', 'a7ca5549-2bd2-4fa4-8e5f-67cd6e74bb3f', 'ad691dc4-452f-4563-8519-35cc5abb0840', 'b1f29706-eb47-4d86-b510-f028ca8b7e75', 'c4cc3e57-3082-49b8-b1a4-77ea92ea5a71', 'cc9548e1-86a1-456c-8da0-f280f3b79083', 'd4df1c80-af30-46f6-ae83-1a40eb5976d5', 'd679f494-78b2-4edb-90ff-ef8ae050cf5a', 'efc7d87a-d49b-489b-a399-28fe7ebeb875']",Generating Neuron Geometries for Detailed Three-Dimensional Simulations Using AnaMorph,Neuroinformatics,2017

1303,"Many methods for multinational License Plate Detection (LPD) have been proposed in recent times but most of them are not sophisticated enough to handle complex backgrounds. Moreover, their ability to handle various environmental and illumination conditions has been limited and still needs improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to detect license plates of vehicles regardless of their color, size, and content. As the rear vehicle lights are an essential part of any vehicle, we reduce the image processing area to eliminate the complex background by detecting the rear-lights as the license plates are in a certain range of these lights.

1304,"This paper investigates two classes of synchronization problems of multiple chaotic systems with unknown uncertainties and disturbances by employing sliding mode control. Modified projective synchronization and transmission synchronization are discussed here. For the modified projective synchronization problem, sliding mode controllers are designed to ensure that multiple response systems synchronize with one drive system under the effects of external disturbances. For the transmission synchronization problem, based on adaptive sliding mode control, an integral sliding surface is selected and the adaptive laws are derived to tackle unknown uncertainties and disturbances for such systems. A class of nonlinear adaptive sliding mode controllers is developed to guarantee asymptotical stability of the error systems so that all chaotic systems can synchronize with each other. Simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes by comparing with the existing methods.","['Xiangyong Chen', 'Ju H.

1306,"Anisotropic scale and translation invariants (ASTI) for Tchebichef moments have been proposed by Zhu et al. [27]. Since these invariants are derived via the decomposition of Tchebichef polynomials, it is unavoidable that the invariant algorithms inherit the complexities from the Tchebichef polynomials defined in terms of hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, in order to achieve anisotropic scale and translation invariance, the computation of translation invariants and scale invariants need to be performed sequentially. These have turned out to be the bottleneck for the invariant algorithms. Experimental results show that some of the computed ASTI features from symmetric patterns are less accurate. Thus, we would like to extend the work of Zhu et al.[27] to simplify the complexity of the algorithms and further improve the accuracy of the computed features. The three terms recurrence relation of the Tchebichef polynomials has been used to simplify and improve the computational efficiency of the invariant algorithms. Skew transformations are deployed to enhance the numerical accuracy of ASTI for Tchebhcief moments. Our studies show that the skewed features are less sensitive to noise and significantly enhance the accuracy of pattern recognition systems. This has been verified by the experiments on recognition of printed English letters and leaf patterns corrupted by noise and scaled and translated deformations. The simplification of the algorithms using the orthogonal property of basis functions also can be used to simplify more complex invariants like affine invariants of discrete Tchebichief moments. It can also be extended to derive invariants for other orthogonal based moments like Legendre moments, Krawtchouk moments, Hahn moments, etc.","['Chih-Yang Pee', 'S. H. Ong', 'P.

1307,"Active module, defined as an area in biological network that shows striking changes in molecular activity or phenotypic signatures, is important to reveal dynamic and process-specific information that is correlated with cellular or disease states. A prior information guided active module identification approach is proposed to detect modules that are both active and enriched by prior knowledge. We formulate the active module identification problem as a multi-objective optimisation problem, which consists two conflicting objective functions of maximising the coverage of known biological pathways and the activity of the active module simultaneously. Network is constructed from protein-protein interaction database. A beta-uniform-mixture model is used to estimate the distribution of p-values and generate scores for activity measurement from microarray data. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to search for Pareto optimal solutions. We also incorporate a novel constraints based on algebraic connectivity to ensure the connectedness of the identified active modules. Application of proposed algorithm on a small yeast molecular network shows that it can identify modules with high activities and with more cross-talk nodes between related functional groups. The Pareto solutions generated by the algorithm provides solutions with different trade-off between prior knowledge and novel information from data. The approach is then applied on microarray data from diclofenac-treated yeast cells to build network and identify modules to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of diclofenac toxicity and resistance. Gene ontology analysis is applied to the identified modules for biological interpretation. Integrating knowledge of functional groups into the identification of active module is an effective method and provides a flexible control of balance between pure data-driven method and prior information guidance.","['Weiqi Chen', 'Jing Liu', 'Shan He']",260dc176-4947-42f0-8dce-323f24f926bf,0,"['1ee1d031-19cf-4bbd-bcb0-38dfbea1e22c', '1f65121f-8894-496c-81c2-c6196c6b3eb3', '397894a7-5671-441b-8d0e-453dc0f2928e', '429a87e1-2594-45bf-84ae-b655c999af5d', '49c20c54-4c0e-44d2-a7bf-30921c73f581', '57651acc-3a83-4323-bde6-de1b095d3481', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '7a4c1906-5a67-42ca-b44f-7683a0f11250', '97680031-f37c-4437-8563-2b6997ec7312', '98b42eb4-d3eb-43fe-b29e-2df7d28b4913', 'a5dfce11-5f69-4b07-b6f2-c3931ee32885', 'b3e3707a-5161-455e-b030-5f3b7c6f16d9', 'c66431fa-2c6d-4148-981e-18eaa8d74fa1', 'd536f87d-bbda-42a1-b55f-63f83bfd85da']",Prior knowledge guided active modules identification: an integrated multi-objective approach,BMC Systems Biology,2017

In this model, four parameters (i.e., distance to available route, length of available route, level of congestion in available route, and capacity of available exit) affect the route choice of the pedestrian and the evacuation route set. In this study, the evacuation route set is created and optimized by a modified social force model and a route learning method. Experimental results show that the extended model can effectively reproduce crowd behavior in an emergency situation, which can assist in analyzing emergency evacuation scenarios. Moreover, two important conclusions regarding increasing evacuation efficiency show that the proposed model is in line with real-world situations.","['Yanbin Han', 'Hong Liu', 'Philip Moore']",c01948f1-de90-41b4-83ff-4a3267f41e44,0,"['0be7e121-dbab-4840-b45d-bbaa7bf6853b', '13ef4040-8380-4251-bab1-74c9677223a6', '33e98a46-6f39-4413-9a4c-49b6036e5d97', '403ecc7c-7be3-412a-87b4-992a3bb92b2c', '412a906f-7ead-4f71-89c6-d22451aa7578', '41f31a47-46ab-4373-ad8f-12196e3fb854', '50246038-7105-4491-b7da-ad39e6e0a934', '5549b698-bb11-45be-9397-5b7c6e0148bf', '69b1c828-e5d5-4d87-becc-e3371f322972', '8c723669-e63c-4810-be7f-e22c7de5e9c1', '9e58054e-ecfe-413e-b2d7-a17094a41467', 'c423cc51-747d-4ea0-9c40-714e2cfc5a1d', 'de4af98b-63b0-4e18-8079-97a25ea5de0c', 'e7bbaaa1-8cb9-4a25-bf8b-db8eb4e9e0e7']",Extended route choice model based on available evacuation route set and its application in crowd evacuation simulation,Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory,2017
1309,"Blood vessels under skin surface have been used as a biometric trait for many years. Traditionally, they are used only in commercial and governmental applications because infrared images are required to capture high quality blood vessels. Recent research results demonstrate that blood vessels can be extracted directly from color images potentially for forensic applications. However, color images taken by consumer cameras are likely compressed by the JPEG compression method. As a result, the quality of the color images is seriously degraded, which makes the blood vessels difficult to be visualized. In this paper, a multi-model restoration algorithm (MMRA) is presented to remove blocking artifacts in JPEG compressed images and restore the lost information. Two mathematical properties in the JPEG compression process are identified and used to design MMRA. MMRA is based on a tailor-made clustering scheme to group training data and learns a model, which predicts original discrete cosine transform coefficients, from each grouped dataset. An open skin image database containing 978 forearm images and 916 thigh images with weak blood vessel information and a set of diverse skin images collected from the Internet are used to evaluate MMRA. Different resolutions and different compression factors are examined. The experimental results show clearly that MMRA restores blood vessels more effectively than the state-of-the-art deblocking methods.","['Xiaojie Li', 'Adams Wai Kin Kong']",db3ce548-6c04-41a4-ae5b-8e7644a2e2e1,0,"['095cd86e-e1f7-4248-9a66-5c57317e4e67', '09c39a63-e6a4-400b-b365-be047dcd9d06', '1d7feeee-de7b-41b7-b7e6-39a61f3fa377', '2934a2b9-457f-432b-9941-d7f26b8e3d13', '3c3cea39-a087-4832-b502-2d55dfa404eb', '3d090900-b097-4c57-b6fe-a0235fad9fee', '3d656602-86e1-4e90-a02c-a93170936090', '56b0b9a0-506c-4b4a-9809-89345e90b80d', '5f18d082-e5b4-4f15-a474-1e34869f57ca', '637e7a69-997f-4619-ac1d-3c4d9f7dbfa6', '644b09c7-d9a9-45a8-b65f-3a33371ce96e', '6b76ea8a-bd5d-47d9-bda9-4848cfcef3d3', '71184c61-c368-4ffe-bf7d-c882ef72f9ec', '7f1214b2-e070-4ff2-a5d3-647e7c16c2d7', '7f9be2e0-248c-41e1-85a5-7be463c54336', '7fa0bf69-079b-494a-9e45-997795e003b3', '7fe5e569-1622-4794-878f-ec0acadfa4e9', '834e9991-fa7e-4b40-9755-ba95bc5cec8b', '83bd0f1c-b74b-4438-89c0-4c97bab04627', '8c10719a-76e2-4924-a9bf-b719e7276b92', '8ff48527-0f0c-46d2-9f94-60aa97d9f6f8', '90a29766-fe6d-4200-aeac-aa07a9de28ed', '934a173e-3af7-4a9d-8dd3-c23adedec70d', '9be6b70e-df81-42bf-ac0a-3afc5832b24b', 'aff5a87f-e9e3-4c19-ab63-93c4d8b1f88d', 'ca92cc9f-32ab-416b-a174-0a59c1146e45', 'ce7dd1c0-b3fb-4690-9d09-1956b0fca97b', 'ced0897a-3ea1-495a-a3ac-5387bd984119', 'd9985e86-d2ec-4ebf-a564-1ce187aacbf7', 'ebb3a28a-a141-4e78-8d6e-ca65c8ce556d', 'ff605dec-6d06-4473-a391-22e6e152ce7e']",A multi-model restoration algorithm for recovering blood vessels in skin images ☆,Image and Vision Computing,2017
1310,"For the first six weeks following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a patient will attend an outpatient clinic typically seen twice weekly. Here, an exercise regime is performed and improvement assessed using a hand held goniometer that measures the maximum angle of knee flexion, an important metric of progress. Additionally a series of daily exercises is performed at home, recorded in a diary. This protocol has problems. Patients must attend the hospital with assistance since they are not permitted to drive for six weeks following the procedure; appointments are sometimes missed; there are occasionally not enough physiotherapy appointment available; furthermore, it is difficult to be sure that patients are compliant with their exercises at home. The economic and social costs are therefore significant both to the patient and the health service. We describe here an automatic system that performs the monitoring of knee flexion within a domestic environment rather than in a hospital setting. It comprises a master and slave sensor unit that attach using Velcro straps to the thigh and shin above and below the operation wound. The patient performs the prescribed knee exercises whilst wearing the device, during which time it measures and records the angles of knee flexion. The device utilises the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) infrastructure to transmit data through the Internet to a secure hospital-based server using an on-board GSM modem. The clinician is then able to view and interpret the information from any computer with internet access and the software. The system does not require the patient to possess a mobile telephone, a computer, or have internet access; the necessary communications technology is completely integrated into the device.","['Yunus Msayib', 'Patrick Gaydecki', 'Michael J.

1311,"As an improvement of the meshless local Petrov–Galerkin (MLPG), the complex variable meshless local Petrov–Galerkin (CVMLPG) method is extended here to dynamic analysis of functionally graded materials (FGMs). In this method, the complex variable moving least-squares (CVMLS) approximation is used instead of the traditional moving least-squares (MLS) to construct the shape functions. The main advantage of the CVMLS approximation over MLS approximation is that the number of the unknown coefficients in the trial function of the CVMLS approximation is less than that of the MLS approximation, thus higher efficiency and accuracy can be achieved under the same node distributions. In implementation of the present method, the variations of the FGMs properties are computed by using material parameters at Gauss points, so it totally avoids the issue of the assumption of homogeneous in each element in the finite element method (FEM) for the FGMs. Several numerical examinations for dynamic analysis of FGMs are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the CVMLPG.","['Baodong Dai', 'Dandan Wei', 'Hongping Ren', 'Zhu Zhang']",790d2d46-a928-4918-8a94-01915abe214a,0,"['336d2acf-6d48-47d1-86fb-84778eb9fb3f', '72a5fe37-464e-4220-9835-ba63d590a860', 'ccafccda-167a-4983-9b42-f9cdd51a9666']",The complex variable meshless local Petrov–Galerkin method for elastodynamic analysis of functionally graded materials,Applied Mathematics and Computation,2017

1313,"In a wide variety of emerging data-intensive applications, such as social network analysis, Web document clustering, entity resolution, and detection of consistently co-expressed genes in systems biology, the detection of dense subgraphs cliques and k-plex is an essential component. Unfortunately, these problems are NP-Complete and thus computationally intensive at scale — hence there is a need to come up with techniques for distributing the computation across multiple machines such that the computation, which is too time-consuming on a single machine, can be efficiently performed on a machine cluster given that it is large enough.#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we first propose a new approach for maximal clique and k-plex enumeration, which identifies dense subgraphs by binary graph partitioning. Given a connected graph G=(V,E)G=(V,E), it has a space complexity of O(|E|)O(|E|) and a time complexity of O(|E|μ(G))O(|E|μ(G)), where μ(G)μ(G) represents the number of different cliques (k-plexes) existing in GG. It recursively divides a graph until each task is sufficiently small to be processed in parallel. We then develop parallel solutions and demonstrate how graph partitioning can enable effective load balancing. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on real and synthetic graph data and show that it performs considerably better than existing approaches in both centralized and parallel settings. In the parallel setting, it can achieve the speedups of up to 10x over existing approaches on large graphs. Our parallel algorithms are primarily implemented and evaluated on MapReduce, a popular shared-nothing parallel framework, but can easily generalize to other shared-nothing or shared-memory parallel frameworks.

1314,"We have developed a new single-particle dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) model for anisotropic particles with different shapes, e.g., prolate or oblate spheroids. In particular, the conservative and dissipative interactions between anisotropic single DPD particles are formulated using a linear mapping from the isotropic model of spherical particles. The proper mapping operator is constructed between each interacting pair of particles at every time step. Correspondingly, the random forces are properly formulated to satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). Notably, the model exactly conserves both linear and angular momentum. We demonstrate the proposed model's accuracy and efficiency by applying it for modeling colloidal ellipsoids. Specifically, we show it efficiently captures the static properties of suspensions of colloidal ellipsoids. The isotropic-nematic transition in an ellipsoidal suspension is reproduced by increasing its volume fraction or the aspect ratio of ellipsoid particles. Moreover, the hydrodynamics and diffusion of a single colloidal ellipsoid (prolate or oblate with moderate aspect ratios) are accurately captured. The calculated drag force on the ellipsoid and its diffusion coefficients (both translational and rotational) agree quantitatively with the theoretical predictions in the Stokes limit.","['Mingge Deng', 'Wenxiao Pan', 'George Em Karniadakis']",1ca7d08a-f521-41aa-8c49-16f135459a72,0,"['258a3736-9554-489c-8dfb-3df727f0b888', '4580d10c-f437-456e-a6dc-1fea4865741f', 'cf492e21-bf3f-4ff3-ad21-4c7f5cd62843']",Anisotropic single-particle dissipative particle dynamics model,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
1315,"It is difficult to implement optimal control for a system whose model is unknown and operation environment is uncertain, such as the intelligent cruise control of vehicles. This article will address the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning by learning the optimal policy from the state transition data. The model-free optimal control algorithm is employed to approximate the optimal control policy for the intelligent cruise control system, which considers the comfort performance and the safety performance comprehensively by setting up a total performance index. The algorithm is implemented by two multi-layer neural networks which are the critic network and the actor network. The critic and actor networks are employed to approximate the stateaction value function and the control action, respectively. In addition, a data collecting strategy is proposed to obtain the state transition data distributed uniformly in the state action space from the running trajectory of the host car. The critic network and the action network are trained alternatively by the collected data until converging. The convergent action network is used to obtain the optimal control policy. At last, the policy is tested on a hardware-in-the-loop simulator built upon dSPACE by comparing with a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller and a proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller. Results show its excellent performance on both aspects of the safety and the comfort.","['Dongbin Zhao', 'Zhongpu Xia', 'Qichao Zhang']",c03b2161-453f-4d3a-b0e0-0f14832d6962,0,"['161a4f2a-40ce-487d-aff9-e29ca453a89f', '1f6aacec-6838-4080-8185-0820a8f544b6', '33d0dd22-63a1-4eea-baa0-e5bd47d3b70f', '38940999-53fc-4a6e-827d-3066bede6b06', '4e7f45fb-a9ce-47a6-9128-8dd74ccc1905', '65e626de-fa42-4991-bf24-5db0689e5aa0', '66f59cea-7d3a-42f5-b505-534fb6e52b39', '67094ee5-4cd7-45e3-a46c-93d753e12d44', '71b4cb36-a1b4-4688-8cf2-35b8bbae42c9', '7439fe44-14d2-4c46-9842-8df372b6428b', '7593ef20-e7ec-447c-b308-6abb3cefc556', '75fe0cb4-6e4a-4af8-88af-e4034152cc33', '842c7aad-c595-458d-806f-27a4cb1ea315', '89037fdb-4006-4788-9619-432c82fb0b30', 'a94a381d-9099-423f-883d-6c5e7f5bc872', 'b51b2c2b-94a4-4162-9a93-dcc91f56c2c6', 'c3752225-4b11-4bf8-9d5c-d5ef64195dab', 'd4bec63e-f2be-4394-9966-60f775e0fc49', 'd582d510-2a67-4649-b42f-24c583b734e2', 'dbbb39c4-0391-4642-b2fc-e62151f5f2b7', 'f3397050-6a04-49f9-9c84-43e612034cc8', 'fb9361dd-42c4-4fac-847f-02913ba14ed6']",Model-Free Optimal Control Based Intelligent Cruise Control with Hardware-in-the-Loop Demonstration [Research Frontier],IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine,2017
1316,"Overhead network packets are a big challenge for intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which may increase system burden, degrade system performance, and even cause the whole system collapse, when the number of incoming packets exceeds the maximum handling capability. To address this issue, packet filtration is considered as a promising solution, and our previous research efforts have proven that designing a trust-based packet filter was able to refine unwanted network packets and reduce the workload of a local IDS. With the development of Internet cooperation, collaborative intrusion detection environments (e.g., CIDNs) have been developed, which allow IDS nodes to collect information and learn experience from others. However, it would not be effective for the previously built trust-based packet filter to work in such a collaborative environment, since the process of trust computation can be easily compromised by insider attacks. In this paper, we adopt the existing CIDN framework and aim to apply a collaborative trust-based approach to reduce unwanted packets. More specifically, we develop a collaborative trust-based packet filter, which can be deployed in collaborative networks and be robust against typical insider attacks (e.g., betrayal attacks). Experimental results in various simulated and practical environments demonstrate that our filter can perform effectively in reducing unwanted traffic and can defend against insider attacks through identifying malicious nodes in a quick manner, as compared to similar approaches.","['Weizhi Meng', 'Wenjuan Li', 'Lam For Kwok']",6c4b1b58-2363-49cb-b680-57b566c3fba6,50,"['029be9a3-f6d2-4bab-bb34-28b1fffe3006', '0305c481-1d43-403a-8313-a6a0bc0680d0', '0e99cc9a-805e-4070-923c-42954e012b9a', '1029c61a-4671-4d27-b14e-20ad0a42f7e8', '11b36c04-a365-47a2-a9eb-7ed4b3f071fc', '11fa79fe-4c55-4cce-87a1-3fdb6e94face', '1f8e5500-0ca6-467c-a5de-3a1d3dd81f3c', '2bd8f353-8396-445d-b03b-16b46dcaab3b', '2ca1f122-e42d-4d8f-8795-dba80e226468', '2faec277-a02c-41c7-b563-a990b4d4e265', '303bc8bf-d146-4897-9aec-11f9e30f2a4e', '305a1fc9-4360-402b-b830-9bde7d33d38f', '4375dd20-11d3-40d0-908c-9c709402740e', '451ab287-b3d5-4f0f-98df-a312111feb4d', '464b6154-3226-47bd-8f3c-975b5a0201c7', '4d8f2ad1-9c71-46dd-8f9a-b42ba0b16530', '57c04ae9-0029-4736-bf33-c29a45cdf27b', '5a0ac747-fc81-48db-8390-cbf30f66d705', '6129b8e3-c5fe-4ee0-b42b-3542f31d4ded', '66a2c34c-5578-40b8-9196-6ee4499e6011', '6c1552ca-8475-466b-a1d4-af7dfb80338c', '6c904104-1c04-4d6e-8510-623a4caa37ca', '71d6b896-a92a-4c3e-a5e1-d57f511ef388', '82f0ab5e-d562-45d3-81e2-3a636b4cafd4', '877da500-642e-4291-8ba9-8eebbf49e232', '9a8c6481-59ec-439f-8195-1d5c922a1119', 'a143788b-c70e-4df7-a30d-a7e82eff886f', 'a57fb967-f656-4f0b-8b0f-930874b33b70', 'c92c5f87-6d45-4a3d-8581-2a924fd66d7d', 'e1b8910c-eabc-4a23-8403-88d5ee78c6fc', 'e93140f8-ff5c-45c0-abd2-57dd471f4ed0', 'fcce8904-5ac3-409d-b56e-ae0c1ce6e6ec']",Towards Effective Trust-Based Packet Filtering in Collaborative Network Environments,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,2017

1319,"Abstract With increasing frequency of Internet use among adolescents, there are growing concerns about their risk for becoming attached to these forms of communication and increased vulnerability for negative online experiences, including cyber victimization. The effect of these experiences on adolescent mental health is not well understood. In this study, we examine how Internet attachment is related to anxiety and depression and assess the mediating effect of cyber victimization on these associations. Participants included 1,151 middle school students (51.4 percent males) aged 10 to 16 (M = 12.7, SD = 0.93). Structural equation models show that greater Internet attachment was associated with more cyber victimization and greater symptoms of anxiety and depression. Cyber victimization mediated the associations between Internet attachment and anxiety and between Internet attachment and depression.

1320,"This paper defines the hazards that can cause direct localized damage or interruption as Spatially Localized Attacks (SLAs). The SLAs-induced impact on a critical infrastructure system (CIS) is modeled as the failure of system components that exist within some localized area while those outside this area remain operating. Instead of identifying and analyzing each type of the SLAs-related hazards, this paper makes a worst-case analysis and proposes a mathematical framework to support resilience optimization of interdependent CISs under the worst SLA. For illustrative purposes, this paper mainly considers two types of strategies to enhance CIS resilience, including protecting weak components, and building new components to increase redundancy. The problem is mathematically formulated as a tri-level defender–attacker–defender model, which is exactly solved by a proposed decomposition algorithm. The case study on interdependent power and water systems demonstrates how the proposed approach can not only identify the optimum resilience enhancement strategy as well as the worst-case SLA, but also analyze the importance of considering interdependencies from both the attacker's and the defender's perspectives.",['Min Ouyang'],894e559a-f993-494b-8d10-4485eaa81899,0,"['133524d0-fae7-4a52-943f-a53a0e255a24', '1b04e657-29f2-49ec-9f8c-ae8123ed4abd', '21b225cf-acc4-46bb-8150-52df3df6b791', '25bb23e7-c857-4fc2-a4f3-607703b346d2', '2b776a92-5ec7-4d37-a6d3-5baeaa348e2d', '38fd9e07-9039-4087-8087-b43e9665db85', '44144021-01cc-4e4a-9f03-d299af5ed4ec', '47bd4427-cd42-4e9c-8d5f-b57b2421a3f5', '526c609f-652c-4ff5-a5e0-80419ec79ddb', '594f227c-68ec-4dcb-8317-0a22e7eb10f3', '65703131-7f8c-4450-8e74-f8e016df7eef', '71e8bd49-2c4b-4a7d-8cc9-fa0b47cf8034', '74646171-d641-4d91-9ca1-02c43300258f', '81d79d24-3fb8-4ed2-833c-ff3980cdeb00', '8343e7eb-2314-4f30-b308-0573f8f97506', '83a6e0da-e831-4660-b65f-f43d0e12cff0', '8df86572-d4df-491c-8f87-7a8fce9a8ddc', '904c9f70-842c-4562-9d92-b215a847615a', '993e709f-6c0f-43d0-a136-27a3b7be6270', 'a57dbc00-d5bc-4707-b2ae-0675f3ac9779', 'a75691ef-f3e0-4b6b-b3de-6a84c12865da', 'b0b21d29-b3d0-449c-a66e-cc9af65c0fff', 'c4ba1da0-f73d-4e1b-a260-8f43564301e6', 'ca7b3800-c22e-4f93-a5bc-25113615716b', 'cb3fa3d2-74da-4b46-a0d2-ee55b9efbad4', 'd3d626a3-6016-46b2-a63d-7c71fea91057', 'd6f73651-1aa8-4129-afdc-ed0c5a8896f7', 'dcb752d0-2a0a-463e-885f-0c4735dea21f', 'e83d950b-c75d-4352-b38c-a7c261a9d939', 'eed947ab-5b9a-4de4-be6a-f3d2b515feac', 'f05b7a7e-35ed-49c1-9fab-3a5242766e41']",A mathematical framework to optimize resilience of interdependent critical infrastructure systems under spatially localized attacks,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
1321,"Tilted transversely isotropic (TTI) media are typical earth anisotropy media from practical observational studies. Accurate anisotropic imaging is recognized as a breakthrough in areas with complex anisotropic structures. TTI reverse time migration (RTM) is an important method for these areas. However, P and SV waves are coupled together in the pseudo-acoustic wave equation. The SV wave is regarded as an artifact for RTM of the P wave. We adopt matching of the anisotropy parameters to suppress the SV artifacts. Another problem in the implementation of TTI RTM is instability of the numerical solution for a variably oriented axis of symmetry. We adopt Fletcher's equation by setting a small amount of SV velocity without an acoustic approximation to stabilize the wavefield propagation. To improve calculation efficiency, we use NVIDIA graphic processing unit (GPU) with compute unified device architecture instead of traditional CPU architecture. To accomplish this, we introduced a random velocity boundary and an extended homogeneous anisotropic boundary for the remaining four anisotropic parameters in the source propagation. This process avoids large storage memory and IO requirements, which is important when using a GPU with limited bandwidth of PCI-E. Furthermore, we extend the single GPU code to multi-GPUs and present a corresponding high concurrent strategy with multiple asynchronous streams, which closely achieved an ideal speedup ratio of 2:1 when compared with a single GPU. Synthetic tests validate the correctness and effectiveness of our multi-GPUs-based TTI RTM method.","['Chun Li', 'Guofeng Liu', 'Yihang Li']",da083c9f-5361-434a-a174-d00385379ed5,0,"['3abd047e-1002-4cd8-85ff-a95741d352b3', '3f01c738-d29b-42d1-b877-ab0773ecb352', '80a8a12a-122d-43f0-b15f-a993b0518356', 'f4f8518b-9b4b-49d5-8c3a-ec8392b083c8']",A practical implementation of 3D TTI reverse time migration with multi-GPUs,Computers & Geosciences,2017
1322,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition is often accompanied by high-frequency electromyographic (EMG) noise. The noise is difficult to be filtered, due to considerable overlapping of its frequency spectrum to the frequency spectrum of the ECG. Today, filters must conform to the new guidelines (2007) for low-pass filtering in ECG with cutoffs of 150 Hz for adolescents and adults, and to 250 Hz for children. We are suggesting a pseudo-real-time low-pass filter, self-adjustable to the frequency spectra of the ECG waves. The filter is based on the approximation procedure of Savitzky–Golay with dynamic change in the cutoff frequency. The filter is implemented pseudo-real-time (real-time with a certain delay). An additional option is the automatic on/off triggering, depending on the presence/absence of EMG noise. The analysis of the proposed filter shows that the low-frequency components of the ECG (low-power P- and T-waves, PQ-, ST- and TP-segments) are filtered with a cutoff of 14 Hz, the high-power P- and T-waves are filtered with a cutoff frequency in the range of 20–30 Hz, and the high-frequency QRS complexes are filtered with cutoff frequency of higher than 100 Hz. The suggested dynamic filter satisfies the conflicting requirements for a strong suppression of EMG noise and at the same time a maximal preservation of the ECG high-frequency components.","['Ivaylo Christov', 'Tatyana Dimitrova Neycheva', 'Ramun Schmid', 'Todor Stoyanov', 'Roger Abächerli']",6cffdf4a-5dc4-43cd-9b5b-3ecade39a225,0,['1d9a260a-f12f-4f63-8131-1874b7818767'],"Pseudo-real-time low-pass filter in ECG, self-adjustable to the frequency spectra of the waves",Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,2017
1323,"In this study, a new predictive framework is proposed by integrating an improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), termed as IGWO-KELM, for medical diagnosis. The proposed IGWO feature selection approach is used for the purpose of finding the optimal feature subset for medical data. In the proposed approach, genetic algorithm (GA) was firstly adopted to generate the diversified initial positions, and then grey wolf optimization (GWO) was used to update the current positions of population in the discrete searching space, thus getting the optimal feature subset for the better classification purpose based on KELM. The proposed approach is compared against the original GA and GWO on the two common disease diagnosis problems in terms of a set of performance metrics, including classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, -mean, -measure, and the size of selected features. The simulation results have proven the superiority of the proposed method over the other two competitive counterparts.","['Qiang Li', 'Huiling Chen', 'Hui Huang', 'Xuehua Zhao', 'ZhenNao Cai', 'Changfei Tong', 'Wenbin Liu', 'Xin Tian']",a69474c2-9669-4eef-930f-4e62bc29ff71,50,"['00491bda-aedf-4041-9607-e05de9e41828', '2031f4bc-21fd-4b74-949c-220bcb94cd1a', '33abc1fc-50ea-4837-a4a0-65c1d4c0e0b7', '3a95bc5d-058a-4f2d-a003-c2dcf47acef7', '454b1efb-c71b-47d2-bdec-c29b7f8e02ca', '4d8517f7-80d1-4da0-9d2b-f42ebfc89467', '4f216462-4cdb-42cc-980f-2ba8157dc222', '5dbea7d1-49df-428e-af93-1f64c0151eeb', '68b6b98a-d68c-46a9-bf58-bf6dd50f484c', '7964a019-c3ce-4055-b974-41266d1f78ed', '8226b1b0-d525-4b34-b7ee-11ff19c88bb9', '8427a55f-bb1e-486e-9436-6e13f637799b', '916a3999-a368-413e-a724-275cbfc6d0ef', 'ad9595b3-8219-4e7e-a5c9-49dc1cf3107d', 'bdd2ec82-d393-4e0b-9cd2-6595a27eb774', 'c58749ac-1135-4a36-a7ca-efa53cd75dbc', 'cbd9bed9-8981-435d-8ce8-b594910baecd', 'ded490f3-5aa4-4af8-87ed-eb23454ff98c', 'eb77c639-a755-446e-af18-7ae6420844e5', 'fa332512-cbca-4456-99f8-588e8821fa92']",An Enhanced Grey Wolf Optimization Based Feature Selection Wrapped Kernel Extreme Learning Machine for Medical Diagnosis,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2017
1324,"An advanced high-temperature reverse bias (HTRB) testing procedure for performing reliability tests on power transistors is reported. The main target is to monitor continuously the degradation trend of tested devices. Therefore, the total HTRB test time is divided into short stress cycles. Thanks to a purposely designed miniature heater, which controls the individual case temperature of devices under test (DUTs), electrical characterization, at low or high temperature, can be performed at the end of each stress period automatically. In this way, DUT's electrical parameters can be periodically measured to identify early warnings of failure, and test can be stopped for the sole out-of-specification devices. In addition, thanks to the fast thermal control, thermal runaway processes can be inhibited, freezing the degradation state to a presettled level, in order to perform appropriate postfailure analysis. Finally, the new HTRB methodology allows for evidencing anomalous behaviors, which are not considered as failures, and the application of low frequency noise measure techniques provides the evidence of the effects of the applied thermo-electrical stress. The proposed HTRB methodology together with low frequency noise measurements are presented as well as the results obtained from the experimental application of the procedure on silicon power MOSFETs.","['Calogero Pace', 'Jorge Hernandez-Ambato', 'Letizia Fragomeni', 'Giuseppe Consentino', 'Alessandro DrIgnoti', 'Salvatore Galiano', 'Antonio Grimaldi']",e0c3d9d0-51a3-4df0-ae3a-7714677edf98,0,"['003a8f8a-1412-4c96-9970-19ba57fa29e1', '1e32a12f-c86d-4aeb-9af7-8352e2746ba9', '6d5eff85-bf18-479c-8378-ba7e8fc95fe2', 'ddb94bf0-0fbf-40e5-85d4-55c7b2b31357', 'e0604a36-a88d-49eb-9040-cdc2d1a78fbf']",A New Effective Methodology for Semiconductor Power Devices HTRB Testing,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2017
1325,"Abstract#R##N#In this work, we present scaled variants of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method, dubbed as (LS)DLPNO-CCSD(T) and (NS)DLPNO-CCSD(T), to obtain accurate interaction energies in supramolecular complexes governed by noncovalent interactions. The novel scaled schemes are based on the linear combination of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) correlation energies calculated with the standard (LoosePNO and NormalPNO) and modified (Loose2PNO and Normal2PNO) DLPNO-CCSD(T) accuracy levels. The scaled DLPNO-CCSD(T) variants provide nearly TightPNO accuracy, which is essential for the quantification of weak noncovalent interactions, with a noticeable saving in computational cost. Importantly, the accuracy of the proposed schemes is preserved irrespective of the nature and strength of the supramolecular interaction. The (LS)DLPNO-CCSD(T) and (NS)DLPNO-CCSD(T) protocols have been used to study in depth the role of the CH–π versus π–π interactions in the supramolecular complex formed by the electron-donor truxene-tetrathiafulvalene (truxTTF) and the electron-acceptor hemifullerene (C30H12). (NS)DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS calculations clearly reveal the higher stability of staggered (dominated by CH–π interactions) versus bowl-in-bowl (dominated by π–π interactions) arrangements in the truxTTF•C30H12 heterodimer. Hemifullerene and similar carbon-based buckybowls are therefore expected to self-assemble with donor compounds in a richer way other than the typical concave–convex π–π arrangement found in fullerene-based aggregates. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","['Joaquín Calbo', 'J.

1326,"In this paper, we focus on distributed moving horizon estimation (DMHE) for a class of two-time-scale nonlinear systems described in the framework of singularly perturbed systems. By taking advantage of the time-scale separation property, a two-time-scale system is first decomposed into a reduced-order fast system and a reduced-order slow system. The slow system is further decomposed into several interconnected slow subsystems. In the proposed distributed state estimation scheme, a local estimator is designed for each slow subsystem and for the reduced-order fast system. The slow subsystem estimators communicate with each other to exchange information and they are only required to send information to the fast system one-directionally. The fast system estimator does not send out any information. The local estimators are designed as observer-enhanced moving horizon estimators. Sufficient conditions on the convergence of the estimation error of the DMHE are derived. The application of the proposed DMHE to a chemical process example demonstrates its applicability and effectiveness.","['Xunyuan Yin', 'Jinfeng Liu']",b1132fab-b64a-44df-9931-06d187b6f4aa,0,"['0fdbf474-10d3-4df3-812e-5a5b10c65f02', '15a0160d-8d91-4154-b9b1-3f8b8a4d1340', '647fd694-28a0-4f7a-8fb2-1fa74d4560f3', 'a9ddc5bd-2bac-4ae5-ab28-c3f9be0aade3', 'c8423fdd-1f5b-4319-b7c2-146eba87eddf', 'd2c9d71c-4662-4b6d-ab08-8ada0db3f970', 'f97e32c9-2345-475c-aa41-8e801bb67b49']",Distributed moving horizon state estimation of two-time-scale nonlinear systems,Automatica,2017

With currently available technology sample sizes for experiments are typically small, meaning that these correlations can be difficult to estimate. At a genome-wide scale estimation of correlation matrices can also be computationally demanding. We develop an empirical Bayes approach to improve covariance estimates for gene expression, where we assume the covariance matrix takes a block diagonal form. Our method shows lower false discovery rates than existing methods on simulated data. Applied to a real data set from Bacillus subtilis we demonstrate it’s ability to detecting known regulatory units and interactions between them. We demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method is able to find significant covariances and also to control false discovery rates, even when the sample size is small (n=10). The method can be used to find potential regulatory networks, and it may also be used as a pre-processing step for methods that calculate, for example, partial correlations, so enabling the inference of the causal and hierarchical structure of the networks.","['Clare Pacini', 'James W.

By incorporating the multiple-antenna factors, we demonstrate that the widely known trend in which the OP is superior to the SP in the regimes of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and slow fading, and vice versa, does not hold in general. As the number of transmit antennas (   $ {n_{\mathrm{ t},},},$   ) increases, the range of operable fading speeds for the OP is significantly narrowed due to limited time resources for channel estimation and insufficient fading samples, which results in the SP being competitive in wider speed and SNR ranges. For a sufficiently small    $ {n_{\mathrm{ t},},},$   , we demonstrate that as the fading variation becomes slower, the estimation quality for the SP can be superior to that for the OP. In this case, the SP outperforms the OP in the slow-fading regime due to full utilization of time for data transmission.","['A.

1337,"We address the problem of optimizing logic-level sequential circuits for low power. We present a powerful sequential logic optimization method that is based on selectively precomputing the output logic values of the circuit one clock cycle before they are required, and using the precomputed values to reduce internal switching activity in the succeeding clock cycle. We present two different precomputation architectures which exploit this observation. The primary optimization step is the synthesis of the precomputation logic, which computes the output values for a subset of input conditions. If the output values can be precomputed, the original logic circuit can be ""turned off"" in the next clock cycle and will have substantially reduced switching activity. The size of the precomputation logic determines the power dissipation reduction, area increase and delay increase relative to the original circuit. Given a logic-level sequential circuit, we present an automatic method of synthesizing precomputation logic so as to achieve maximal reductions in power dissipation. We present experimental results on various sequential circuits. Up to 75% reductions in average switching activity and power dissipation are possible with marginal increases in circuit area and delay. >","['Mazhar Alidina', 'José C.

1338,"Contemporary Content Delivery Networks (CDN) handle a vast number of content items. At such a scale, the replication schemes require a significant amount of time to calculate and realize cache updates, and hence they are impractical in highly-dynamic environments. This paper introduces cluster-based replication, whereby content items are organized in clusters according to a set of features, given by the cache/network management entity. Each cluster is treated as a single item with certain attributes,  e.g. , size, popularity,  etc.  and it is then altogether replicated in network caches so as to minimize overall network traffic. Clustering items reduces replication complexity; hence it enables faster and more frequent caches updates, and it facilitates more accurate tracking of content popularity. However, clustering introduces some performance loss because replication of clusters is more coarse-grained compared to replication of individual items. This tradeoff can be addressed through proper selection of the number and composition of clusters. Due to the fact that the exact optimal number of clusters cannot be derived analytically, an efficient approximation method is proposed. Extensive numerical evaluations of time-varying content popularity scenarios allow to argue that the proposed approach reduces core network traffic, while being robust to errors in popularity estimation.","['Lazaros Gkatzikis', 'Vasilis Sourlas', 'Carlo Fischione', 'Iordanis Koutsopoulos']",01e61df9-a56a-4e19-8f33-919aa406c223,0,"['0a759449-5cf8-4a94-8d01-ba827e1e3a9e', '0d6602c1-7ee3-4f3a-98c1-a3aeb6169839', '11f17e39-cbac-4f09-acda-b57ea6963861', '12f6914d-8045-4aa5-88c1-1c90a1990dbf', '213863c6-72c9-4a52-a11e-0c2dfb4343fd', '23f8c5a4-f892-491f-8bc5-1d791a7f5557', '27f6043e-6356-4773-88be-d423a67bdecc', '297dbbd8-71e3-4de2-95b1-c7ddc9a88b09', '2edfb043-c8bf-4b29-8743-9c6532656e12', '32044a8e-45a0-439f-9773-dc008a7e4fd3', '34077233-74b4-48e4-8192-022632aa1e09', '351b70b6-d46b-4e1c-bc6e-f89f233ede74', '36f0f3cb-6b32-4284-8e08-0972ee67074f', '4c22d592-7dae-416a-b376-a000a5ded3cc', '4ec16ce6-07d1-4ad4-bd4d-f64b2be5599b', '5f33275d-098b-4963-9f60-2284acf1e1db', '68cddb8c-5c0c-4ce7-b477-713c05e8df02', '6fb8c97c-2a05-452c-b04f-4252ac70e39a', '74db62cb-e385-40ed-b7e2-09086d28136e', '7d54efd0-b9e5-4a5a-bfca-4c38eb5c677a', '8b342349-cab5-4340-9520-e422d73e27f8', '94b0b7b8-5662-487a-9ecd-303fbff09b01', 'a49609b7-3733-476b-b853-0e5200aa4787', 'baf83ee2-b92d-456a-87a4-daa416d182d3', 'bdd48f50-d126-43fb-80d9-5cd346225209', 'be0fef07-03a8-465c-a154-b58d69430785', 'c25e6b7b-3053-4250-880b-1e1037921895', 'c25fb77e-5ff4-4cc4-92c2-6b54f033310b', 'c599bdb5-9b7e-4b3c-85fb-661f096ae330', 'c9f2d4c5-27d6-4b31-9725-ca3c9979e481', 'cb0fdd46-2672-4b89-9315-685fa7e0f994', 'd124545a-b710-4ab4-8b3b-dca2567596cd', 'd4c70c8e-53d7-4bbb-8ec2-0d1b92c9704b', 'dd3a52d3-68a7-417a-a85d-093a1b7d41ad', 'e917476a-95cc-47a8-a3eb-b4d3bea8405a', 'ef463402-05e5-4451-a72f-6766e3db3b1d', 'f2786ada-3e72-4dc7-997c-1ffeeb7279d2']",Low complexity content replication through clustering in Content-Delivery Networks,Computer Networks,2017
1339,"Scale problems are a major source of concern in the field of remote sensing. Since the remote sensing is a complex technology system, there is a lack of enough cognition on the connotation of scale and scale effect in remote sensing. Thus, this paper first introduces the connotations of pixel-based scale and summarizes the general understanding of pixel-based scale effect. Pixel-based scale effect analysis is essentially important for choosing the appropriate remote sensing data and the proper processing parameters. Fractal dimension is a useful measurement to analysis pixel-based scale. However in traditional fractal dimension calculation, the impact of spatial resolution is not considered, which leads that the scale effect change with spatial resolution can't be clearly reflected. Therefore, this paper proposes to use spatial resolution as the modified scale parameter of two fractal methods to further analyze the pixel-based scale effect. To verify the results of two modified methods (MFBM (Modified Windowed Fractal Brownian Motion Based on the Surface Area) and MDBM (Modified Windowed Double Blanket Method)); the existing scale effect analysis method (information entropy method) is used to evaluate. And six sub-regions of building areas and farmland areas were cut out from QuickBird images to be used as the experimental data. The results of the experiment show that both the fractal dimension and information entropy present the same trend with the decrease of spatial resolution, and some inflection points appear at the same feature scales. Further analysis shows that these feature scales (corresponding to the inflection points) are related to the actual sizes of the geo-object, which results in fewer mixed pixels in the image, and these inflection points are significantly indicative of the observed features. Therefore, the experiment results indicate that the modified fractal methods are effective to reflect the pixel-based scale effect existing in remote sensing data and it is helpful to analyze the observation scale from different aspects. This research will ultimately benefit for remote sensing data selection and application.","['Guixiang Feng', 'Dongping Ming', 'Min Wang', 'Jianyu Yang']",0cd2e2bd-6b4e-40f4-924e-346a6ca64486,0,"['1388d879-d77a-45d9-8c1a-e9ac52eb60ba', '1d57e04a-e84f-4c2c-8d43-5ff1dce6917f', '4c364d5d-ddbd-4731-8168-77eeff65aa19', '5530eb0b-035f-4170-ab4e-e45f15db72f9', '603ad5bd-57a0-4087-b11d-96b43ba3e764', '9aa3aa29-eb5f-4a49-948e-9fafb33ffa25', 'd12c8fca-a82c-45db-b29c-8fc7a47fce2e', 'd5adb591-3e02-49d0-98d0-2119f5681a34', 'e37bea3d-1ba0-45d2-a917-35c3fdb278b0']",Connotations of pixel-based scale effect in remote sensing and the modified fractal-based analysis method,Computers & Geosciences,2017

1342,"In this paper, a computational framework is proposed to perform a fully automatic segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) cavity from short-axis cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. In the initial phase, the region of interest (ROI) is automatically identified on the first image frame of the CMR slices. This is done by partitioning the image into different regions using a standard fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm where the LV region is identified according to its intensity, size and circularity in the image. Next, LV segmentation is performed within the identified ROI by using a novel clustering method that utilizes an objective functional with a dissimilarity measure that incorporates a circular shape function. This circular shape-constrained FCM algorithm is able to differentiate pixels with similar intensity but are located in different regions (e.g. LV cavity and non-LV cavity), thus improving the accuracy of the segmentation even in the presence of papillary muscles. In the final step, the segmented LV cavity is propagated to the adjacent image frame to act as the ROI. The segmentation and ROI propagation are then iteratively executed until the segmentation has been performed for the whole cardiac sequence. Experiment results using the LV Segmentation Challenge validation datasets show that our proposed framework can achieve an average perpendicular distance (APD) shift of 2.23 ± 0.50 mm and the Dice metric (DM) index of 0.89 ± 0.03, which is comparable to the existing cutting edge methods. The added advantage over state of the art is that our approach is fully automatic, does not need manual initialization and does not require a prior trained model.","['Xulei Yang', 'Qing Song', 'Yi Su']",38c8d1a2-2cf8-4452-80cb-101501f8dbac,0,"['06d23791-2e03-4e1d-8030-d9a845919052', '0c954a5b-0efc-484c-a34d-8caaab2a8422', '0f87fd1e-a38a-4f7d-92aa-17e3ebd98f39', '18c0a2a3-4b93-4c64-a660-f17fcd871370', '2e923dfc-04f3-4dd0-9966-f4486e94da00', '60ea96fe-d56f-4690-becf-f9aa2ed7cb0d', '749c92f6-1cd6-471b-b425-b22a8da8ca29', '7dcc307d-b1b5-4e34-9614-8e46c3b864e7', '81087879-e157-457f-ab55-c3a033bb396e', '8595ca34-4a51-43d3-8e88-9b0f64e0a520', '9f7d879d-d485-4e01-a4bd-8fc8688c1fda', 'c12e70e4-88e8-4749-b1c1-c84a55c37253', 'dd5b947a-6a8b-4012-b4fb-069d7cfc7a1c', 'e429a44d-51ac-4e0f-9e8a-674471c93313']",Automatic segmentation of left ventricle cavity from short-axis cardiac magnetic resonance images,Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing,2017

1344,"An innovative short term wind power prediction system is proposed which exploits the learning ability of deep neural network based ensemble technique and the concept of transfer learning. In the proposed DNN-MRT scheme, deep auto-encoders act as base-regressors, whereas Deep Belief Network is used as a meta-regressor. Employing the concept of ensemble learning facilitates robust and collective decision on test data, whereas deep base and meta-regressors ultimately enhance the performance of the proposed DNN-MRT approach. The concept of transfer learning not only saves time required during training of a base-regressor on each individual wind farm dataset from scratch but also stipulates good weight initialization points for each of the wind farm for training. The effectiveness of the proposed, DNN-MRT technique is expressed by comparing statistical performance measures in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and standard deviation error (SDE) with other existing techniques.","['Aqsa Saeed Qureshi', 'Asifullah Khan', 'Aneela Zameer', 'Anila Usman']",00f22401-c479-4de1-ad93-5808d2ab32cc,0,"['17d87c0d-4286-427c-afa4-1a406bc38ecb', '3715c870-6569-4d20-8797-af8569e5fde5', '3977f148-6408-4e34-b312-e0650aa07f3c', '50db8b5d-66c0-4ccc-b7ff-6266f2924131', '78169f43-38a7-42e6-bc1f-4782b2cb60db', '7c04c774-95cf-4346-9ee5-57aa7e552a02', 'bc72c4b8-964f-40b2-b0bc-a1db52fe0615', 'bedc71a4-2ab6-4140-99d8-1151cf0dbd38', 'd73203e1-c058-4d7d-ab66-d3e019bbb04a', 'd7d778ec-5ff5-4597-81aa-34202d1a5e1c', 'f35ced32-c5ec-46fa-9be2-2bd3fed8af7c']",Wind power prediction using deep neural network based meta regression and transfer learning,Applied Soft Computing,2017
1345,"In this paper, we extend recent results on state and boundary parameter estimation in coupled systems of linear partial differential equations (PDEs) of the hyperbolic type consisting of   n     n        rightward and one leftward convecting equations, to the general case which involves an arbitrary number of PDEs convecting in both directions. Two adaptive observers are derived based on swapping design, where one introduces a set of filters that can be used to express the system states as linear, static combinations of the filter states and the unknown parameters. Standard parameter identification laws can then be applied to estimate the unknown parameters. One observer which requires sensing at both boundaries, generates estimates of the boundary parameters and system states, while the second observer estimates the parameters from sensing limited to the boundary anti-collocated with the uncertain parameters. Proof of boundedness of the adaptive laws is offered, and sufficient conditions ensuring exponential convergence are derived. The theory is verified in simulations.","['Henrik Anfinsen', 'Mamadou Diagne', 'Ole Morten Aamo', 'Miroslav Krstic']",1307793e-20a3-4302-81fb-32771f567ab2,50,"['055f4431-d620-4b3a-be2b-a010e200b27c', '0e889d6a-2446-40a1-bfa9-62001e3c6907', '2461b438-1020-49f1-94c4-6a287695648f', '253269f5-9042-4c5b-b57c-fe0abfc9d636', '32e3a29b-7fac-4ab3-9147-31c4fa8b0cc4', '3ca2653e-af87-4b90-a826-6cd38531d2d4', '435f85e6-5af6-417b-9229-9b2515d7246f', '57ae227e-d5a8-48ff-83bc-ac0efa20c0db', '6bc0f7c8-c6b9-4e4e-b65d-733cbc1e7e35', '7c6ad607-a0ee-410a-83dc-429cfecb4e41', '82656eb8-806f-4489-b844-f19efc7ec763', '94a06cb0-0ca0-461e-8bff-357259a2ffdf', 'a8049107-a9c0-4468-9b4f-8e56cbbe1b88', 'a8779825-e55c-4b77-b25d-eace191b0b58', 'bc57850e-1cd2-45ec-9431-9c73ff804bac', 'c36578f4-4fcf-4b9e-a02e-af3616deb592', 'eaadab53-41fc-458e-a9a8-a985e4ec1cb6']",Estimation of boundary parameters in general heterodirectional linear hyperbolic systems,Automatica,2017
1346,"In this paper an immersed boundary method with semi-implicit fluid–solid coupling for mobile particles of arbitrary density ratio is developed. The new scheme does not require any iterations to balance fluid forces and particle forces at the interface. A new formulation of the particle equations of motion is proposed which not only accounts for the particle itself but also for a Lagrangian layer surrounding the particle surface. Furthermore, it is shown by analytical considerations that the six equations for the linear and angular velocity of the spherical particle decouple which allows their sequential solution. On this basis a new time integration scheme is obtained which is unconditionally stable for all fluid–solid density ratios and enables large time steps, with Courant numbers around unity. The new scheme is extensively validated for various test cases and its convergence is assessed. An appealing issue is that compared to existing immersed boundary methods the new scheme only alters coefficients in the particle equations and the order of the steps, making it easy to implement in present codes with explicit coupling. This substantially extends the field of application of such methods.","['Silvio Tschisgale', 'Tobias Kempe', 'Jochen Fröhlich']",40f5cca4-840d-46b3-bea4-d687ba04014b,0,"['0202700d-73a2-46c1-97c6-83d8b1d3900d', '07cd3e4e-9253-41fd-964c-60b06ecc3c51', '29502e10-aa40-4e1b-ab13-7367080ab3a5', '302a3920-6d9d-4da1-810a-535765a4518d', '4b6d532e-56f1-4ad4-b622-4c35a0e5fb79', '5e32955b-ce18-40a2-b2fe-46f9a1fae972', 'e7b12306-c3b1-4761-a6ed-37e5468b3f1b']",A non-iterative immersed boundary method for spherical particles of arbitrary density ratio,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
1347,"Hydrocarbons can cause anomalies in the energy density of seismic signals when seismic waves pass through them. Teager–Kaiser energy (TKE) is an important attribute that can be utilized to depict the energy density of a seismic signal and the energy distribution of a seismic wavefield. In this letter, a novel spectral decomposition-based approach for hydrocarbon detection is proposed that applies the variational mode decomposition (VMD) associated with TKE to seismic data, which is called the VMDTKE algorithm. The proposed method not only possesses the better performance of TKE in focusing instantaneous energy, but also inherits the merit of high time–frequency resolution from VMD. The Marmousi2 example is used to demonstrate that the VMDTKE approach is capable of depicting the location and extent of strong anomalies which correlate to hydrocarbons more clearly. We compare the spectral decomposition results with that from the conventional VMD-based method. Application on field data further confirms the potential of the VMDTKE algorithm in delineating strong amplitude anomalies that are associated with hydrocarbon reservoirs.","['Wei Liu', 'Siyuan Cao', 'Zhiming Wang', 'Xiangzhan Kong', 'Yangkang Chen']",88494b28-6b82-4157-adf9-1a956f4bf3ad,0,"['057816cb-37e6-4925-9bd3-e0c1fea6b0be', '2d1a63fe-8eb0-444c-af1f-0e11c1735788', '3f35facc-f42d-426e-bc37-243934dce0fd', '3fc18009-d4d2-4e71-b2cb-bd7b3541334d', '48a934e0-1ebf-48b1-9cfd-9e523fff34b0', '57694f12-e10c-4e10-b7fe-9049532800fc', '5778c33d-c44e-4e68-82ac-6b515caf4a30', '7dfb26a1-34c4-4b56-b3e0-65d3259d0946', '811a38aa-daf5-4f03-b425-795f2cb4e73d', '8d8b3fad-29bc-499e-ba1a-3fd64bfc212d', '9461c4cc-89f4-42fb-9fa2-3b4af8fe64fd']",Spectral Decomposition for Hydrocarbon Detection Based on VMD and Teager–Kaiser Energy,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017

1350,"We present a finite volume method that is applicable to hyperbolic PDEs including spatially varying and semilinear nonconservative systems. The spatial discretization, like that of the well-known Clawpack software, is based on solving Riemann problems and calculating fluctuations (not fluxes). The implementation employs weighted essentially nonoscillatory reconstruction in space and strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta integration in time. The method can be extended to arbitrarily high order of accuracy and allows a well-balanced implementation for capturing solutions of balance laws near steady state. This well-balancing is achieved through the $f$-wave Riemann solver and a novel wave-slope WENO reconstruction procedure. The wide applicability and advantageous properties of the method are demonstrated through numerical examples, including problems in nonconservative form, problems with spatially varying fluxes, and problems involving near-equilibrium solutions of balance laws.","['David I.

We proposed a method to label automatically mobile apps in terms of whether and to what extent they can satisfy users’ particular psychological needs. First, using the grounded theory approach, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews to identify types of needs associated with app usage. Substantive and theoretical coding of the data from the interviews as well as data from samples of app reviews yielded eight types of psychological needs app users had: utilitarian, low-cost, security, health, hedonic, social, cognitive, and self-actualization needs. Second, using the needs corpus (words and phrases) generated above, a classifier was trained using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to filter reviews in terms of whether they included needs-related comments.

1352,"The ever-increasing demand for web applications deployed across multiple data centers results in large electricity costs for service providers and significant impact on the environment. This has motivated service providers to move towards more sustainable data centers powered by renewable or green sources of energy, such as solar or wind. However, efficient utilization of green energy to service web applications is a challenging problem due to intermittency and unpredictability of both application workload and renewable energy availability. One possible solution to reduce cost and increase renewable energy utilization is to exploit the spatio-temporal variations in on-site power and grid power prices by balancing the load among multiple data centers geographically distributed. In this paper, we propose a framework for reactive load balancing of web application requests among Geo-distributed sustainable data centers based on the availability of renewable energy sources on each site. A system prototype is developed, its underlying design and algorithms are described, and experiments are conducted with it using real infrastructure (Grid'5000 in France) and workload traces (real traffic to English Wikipedia). The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reduce cost and brown energy usage with efficient utilization of green energy and without a priori knowledge of future workload, availability of renewable energy, and grid electricity prices.","['Adel Nadjaran Toosi', 'Chenhao Qu', 'Marcos Dias de Assunção', 'Rajkumar Buyya']",08f6c489-80e4-4e03-9ce3-4d233121a9ca,0,"['093af173-bd56-45c2-9d9d-42f0bfe34325', '0c0a4df9-bdff-43cb-addb-202493fb6d06', '2249439e-e080-4ea1-9d7c-c753a36ec2ad', '24cd2205-a328-4d8b-b929-163e10c5354f', '268277c7-5903-474f-9f96-ed43d6b547b0', '2f944607-c96f-4c7a-93f2-81983879d3ff', '340b3a61-dcc4-4763-8a25-a2c876d5d61d', '34a4d4ca-7820-4b5d-a820-1252fe65133d', '3675d6c2-6264-44ce-a1d6-2fb32492de2c', '3df63460-61ca-43e1-93d3-de86fe5278b0', '3fe86e4f-3a61-4328-8c30-28df4f1b41cb', '43ec0728-4265-440a-bf80-bfb3251e5ec2', '4553b500-984c-4ebc-b1a4-f37e6243db5b', '46b3d9cc-391b-4cfc-afa7-86c453273aed', '48ed1ade-f4fd-4105-9efb-8266a3a28204', '6100ebc9-80b5-46a7-a41f-a13044c315b6', '6de51c8f-5fe1-4079-8d71-ebaf91fb7acb', '70c9d312-0c9e-4a46-b4de-b78c721f253e', '72d89a52-fd23-4bf6-8949-db94d1e5a0b6', '75cc927c-63a2-4376-9755-dcbede78aee5', '76bbc144-3a33-4589-a7bb-53714f60378a', '8457d456-65a1-4b01-8390-13e3a3da0c4b', '862e4da6-2cb0-40c1-adf7-7d35f58c9b1d', '9209c241-b066-4f71-b343-cda0659641e2', 'ae6a9447-90b7-4f92-ad86-8376f08e3f66', 'b338dc1f-37aa-442e-a3f5-eb0279cb014e', 'd5e7d1f5-af73-4ed6-b1a9-8f808d10221a', 'e27277b5-1d32-4b32-94b8-29d09a78346b', 'e5fe528c-4f82-4cbc-a30f-c70978ee431b', 'ea03ec88-1521-428c-b97e-a52d3068fce3', 'f15213f3-22f1-4dda-a7d4-c8ee3c4f0eb5', 'f2768d58-3b6e-47b9-b0c7-9a203df005f9', 'f8afb159-fd53-491f-a0bc-54aeef383f37']",Renewable-aware geographical load balancing of web applications for sustainable data centers,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017
1353,"We show that elimination by aspects (EBA) generalizes nested logit and cross-nested logit models. The latter two models are equivalent to a special case of EBA called preference trees. The transformations between preference trees and nested logit models become more complex when the utilities of alternatives are functions of covariates. In this case, a simple model in one domain corresponds to a complex model in the other. An extended EBA model, in which the utilities of alternatives are functions of covariates, represents a two-stage choice process. Alternatives are first screened using a probabilistic lexicographic rule and then compared in terms of their compensatory utilities. We provide a typology of the relations between EBA and other logit models, and we discuss issues concerning estimation, statistical testing, and data collection. We describe an application illustrating (1) the process of constructing a preference tree with covariates and (2) the different implications obtained from a preference t...","['Rajeev Kohli', 'Kamel Jedidi']",b01fdd3b-522b-4be3-adf6-05de397081fb,50,"['a901f909-e4b8-4739-9008-faf831f098e8', 'b3013fcf-ab80-4750-887a-4711f4835f82']",Relation Between EBA and Nested Logit Models,Operations Research,2017

1355,"Although several methods for estimating the resistance of a random Boolean function against (fast) algebraic attacks were proposed, these methods are usually infeasible in practice for relatively large number of input variables  n  (for instance  n  ≥ 30) due to increased computational complexity. An efficient estimation of the resistance of Boolean functions, with relatively large number of inputs  n , against (fast) algebraic attacks appears to be a rather difficult task. In this paper, the concept of partial linear relations decomposition is introduced, which decomposes any given nonlinear Boolean function into many linear (affine) subfunctions by using the disjoint sets of input variables. Based on this result, a general probabilistic decomposition algorithm for nonlinear Boolean functions is presented which gives a new framework for estimating the resistance of Boolean function against (fast) algebraic attacks. It is shown that our new probabilistic method gives very tight estimates (lower and upper bound) and it only requires about  O ( n  2 2  n  ) operations for a random Boolean function with  n  variables, thus having much less time complexity than previously known algorithms.","['Yongzhuang Wei', 'Enes Pasalic', 'Fengrong Zhang', 'S.

1356,"Identification of diseases based on processing and analysis of medical images is of great importance for medical doctors to assist them in their decision making. In this work, a new feature extraction method based on human tissue density patterns, named Analysis of Human Tissue Densities (AHTD) is presented. The proposed method uses radiological densities of human tissues in Hounsfield Units to tackle the extraction of suitable features from medical images. This new method was compared against: the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix, Hu’s moments, Statistical moments, Zernike’s moments, Elliptic Fourier features, Tamura’s features and the Statistical Co-occurrence Matrix. Four machine learning classifiers were applied to each feature extractor for two CT image datasets:, one to classify lung disease in CT images of the thorax and the other to classify stroke in CT images of the brain. The attributes were extracted from the lung images in 5.2 ms and obtained an accuracy of 99.01% for the detection and classification of lung diseases, while the attributes from the brain images were extracted in 3.8 ms and obtained an accuracy of 98.81% for the detection and classification of stroke. These results show that the proposed method can be used to classify diseases in medical images, and can be used in real-time applications due to its fast extraction time of suitable attributes.","['Pedro Pedrosa Rebouças Filho', 'Elizângela de S.

To derive both results, we represent partitions as points of some geometric space, called orbit space. Then we draw on results from the theory of Frechet means and stochastic programming. The asymptotic properties hold for continuous extensions of standard cluster criteria (indices). The results justify consensus clustering using finite but sufficiently large sample sizes. Furthermore, the orbit space framework provides a mathematical foundation for studying further statistical, geometrical, and analytical properties of sets of partitions.",['Brijnesh J.

1358,"Ensemble forecasting is becoming increasingly popular as a hydrological forecasting tool because of its advantages of not only predicting the most likely outcome of a hydrological event, but also providing related uncertainty information. Rank histogram is one of the most widely used metrics for verifying the reliability of ensemble forecasts. This study proposed an improved rank histogram method, the Rank Polar Diagram (Rpolar diagram), for evaluating the reliability of ensemble forecasts of extreme events. The conventional rank histogram provided a simple evaluation of the reliability of an ensemble forecast, which could not differentiate the reliability of the forecasts of extreme events such as heavy storms, high flows and low flows. Rpolar diagrams were able to verify not only the overall reliability but also the partial reliability over different flow intervals, including extremes. In Rpolar diagram, forecast intervals could be set according to user preference or uniform intervals automatically. This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Rpolar diagram using two typical sets of simulation ensembles and actual streamflow/precipitation ensembles. Both streamflow and precipitation application results exhibited the suitability of the Rpolar diagrams for verifying the reliability of extreme events.","['Jing Xu', 'Aizhong Ye', 'Qingyun Duan', 'Feng Ma', 'Zheng Zhou']",73d40db8-0255-4a17-abd9-3db46a8918ea,0,"['37cbab4b-24c5-47b6-90a2-610d2c4f8a44', '494100cb-a466-4f5d-a721-898d917f9ea3', '857f9c38-9d4d-457e-8920-850e0141b880', 'c678e11d-e5ff-493d-b6ac-9cd1972fba49', 'ceb182ae-9b1e-4bbf-91f7-fc468a2b6092']",Improvement of rank histograms for verifying the reliability of extreme event ensemble forecasts,Environmental Modelling and Software,2017
1359,"This study is to examine the structure, characteristics, and change of a research collaboration network using co-assignee information of joint patents in Korea. The study was conducted in three stages: data collection, network construction, and network analysis. For network analysis, network topological analysis, node centrality analysis, and block modeling were performed in sequence. The analysis results revealed that the network has small-world properties. The results also showed that while government-sponsored research institutes (GRIs) played a role as a hub and bridge in the network in the early 2000s, universities gradually took their place to play a key role as a hub and bridge in the network. In addition, the block modeling analysis indicated that while, in the early 2000s, GRI-centered network density was shown to be high, the network density became concentrated around universities after 2004, and this tendency intensified after 2008. Bearing in mind a lack of empirical studies on inter-organizational research collaboration networks using patent data, this study made an academic contribution by specifically analyzing the structure and change of research collaboration networks by targeting Korea’s major innovative actors. From the policy perspective, it provides important implications for figuring out the effects of university–industry–GRI (UIG) collaboration policies implemented so far, and can be of assistance for making evidence-based policies to build up a more effective UIG collaboration network or establish a new national science and technology innovation system.","['Ho Chull Choe', 'Duk Hee Lee']",a49a6352-8a77-4c2e-b841-4aeec361c7be,0,"['1dc439fc-641d-4fed-aa82-099814e4df7c', '3fa58265-69b9-4fe3-bb21-3ad61cad3071', '43ed3cde-24a7-427b-9ed8-850130c4fd19', '46d6eece-0327-44a6-8862-7fa4ba5dad1a', '60ef3852-fa16-44bf-9434-9909268ba5d8', '6b6a33fe-043b-42ba-85e2-8856f88d5ac4', '71927552-43a7-44eb-9eec-7ec1dc9edeec', 'a1900753-fd73-4f0a-a2c8-6ef2da79707c', 'd153be38-60e4-499f-8f57-65a245730a5d', 'd71f089c-0658-478a-b58e-bb8e6f131c21', 'e1ee5daf-37df-4271-b87f-b36994d5cfd3', 'f2771a5d-eded-461a-9abe-f6f6b8872d17']",The structure and change of the research collaboration network in Korea (2000–2011): network analysis of joint patents,Scientometrics,2017
1360,"Identification of characters in TV series and movies is an important and challenging problem. Actor identification results are important information for many higher level multimedia analysis tasks, such as semantic indexing and retrieval, interaction analysis and video summarization. Compared with previous works on actor identification that mainly focus on static features based on face identification and costume detection, our work in this paper attempts to use abundant dynamic information contained in videos to improve the performance when the appearances of actors are hard to detect or changes greatly over time. We propose to mine representative actions of each actor, and show the remarkable power of such actions for actor identification. Videos are firstly divided into shots and represented by Bag of Words (BoW) using spatial-temporal features. Integrating the prototype theory with representativeness, we propose two novel methods to rank the shots and obtain the representative actions. Our methods for actor identification combines representative actions with actors’ appearance. We validate the performance of the proposed methods on episodes of the TV series “The Big Bang Theory”. The experimental results show that the representative actions are consistent with human judgements and can greatly improve the matching performance as complementary to existing handcrafted static features for actor identification.","['Wenlong Xie', 'Hongxun Yao', 'Xiaoshuai Sun', 'Sicheng Zhao', 'Wei Yu', 'Shengping Zhang']",9fd20e95-6b08-4776-a409-eb3c2a0e8051,0,"['05c83189-ff1b-4f23-811b-b7dbff9f5b66', '11a5967e-3fa9-411d-aea6-8d358bd86684', '189125ac-bb20-4282-8c1a-a9dc3b1d1430', '1bb39b41-b763-4648-b877-7c2ae6bdb0d7', '1fa6d24b-43a7-4e66-946d-0efb35c12010', '24ac57e7-994a-4485-b2cb-76eef88d74fc', '2553590e-7183-44bd-a88c-33b18d08d120', '34baef8c-7ac6-4e98-8f8e-2fc89895889f', '353a9d0a-3a4f-4160-ac4b-c13b3579d17c', '35c80a53-6b49-4453-9f2e-57127d7e2f93', '38a9ddd9-4cd7-402e-a773-792b44d7b83a', '440e15b8-57ee-4ad8-850d-ac0c9a16ddb7', '472f74cf-0ce6-4138-aca0-81454f5018b1', '4e39daf1-fb27-4f1d-a6a9-a2c845dc8b8a', '4f65faaf-0c91-4e3d-88e8-28ae9ec2bef0', '50a84351-8946-4d19-91cf-099539317e16', '54e2da8e-7ae6-4b44-a3a1-a56b869b26b4', '56d4b755-81d9-4987-9272-e43cf71e2ee8', '62b392ce-a2d4-4dcf-b9fb-8cb8bf7c674f', '6dd46f95-cad2-4e02-b0f7-1c04cd64d5be', '8bfe17eb-b550-4c9f-abc6-ab89569b1b29', '92de9e4e-33e5-42f5-9c16-e6b5d64e02f7', '96b45b5b-4ab5-468f-80a4-1ed1923cd481', '9a281963-feb8-44a4-94e7-a378e29f6632', '9b8a49b5-a5cb-4c61-8c60-3bde6d310009', 'a1879950-eb22-49eb-98f9-2e07b7a599ec', 'aacc9251-8e66-44e8-802a-8fb655225d18', 'af242003-775b-4119-bc7f-8caf1fba776c', 'b19508d8-292f-4030-b0c7-f0ce668ae181', 'b1d69fef-097c-4892-8725-fd2bbdc0777c', 'b5770254-575a-4a76-851c-f6d69cdf7ad0', 'b914b960-17e5-4128-8361-f2e333b22865', 'b99ab031-0b7f-4237-8690-fc0df5d75b15', 'e2f132c4-8992-4ace-996f-8b3837d851ba', 'e780d48e-9650-4eab-9f59-b4a280e9e76a', 'e8b666d6-c0b1-4501-8e82-05ad62952ed7', 'ef2fc1dd-3d3f-437a-92f7-bc445643c698', 'f2e1a1a6-b339-45d6-bc70-f98fa768ba1b', 'f4f7690d-7640-473e-85ed-22165b54e716', 'f8003f18-beb6-4a35-91e4-cf816bd0ebc0', 'faae469e-68c1-415e-8ca9-400eb777f9f4']",Actor identification via mining representative actions,Neurocomputing,2017
1361,"Facebook plays an important role in the lives of adolescents, but little is known about how they use this tool and how inter-individual variation may be related to psychological variables. Our goal is to search for different profiles of Facebook use and analyze how these profiles are differentially associated with developmental variables. Participants were 761 adolescents (54% girls) between 14 and 18 years old (M = 15.98, SD = 1.08). To create the profiles we used combinatory cluster analysis. Multivariate analyses of variance as a function of the clusters were performed with: personality, parental attachment, peer alienation and interpersonal competence. We found four different clusters of Facebook use that presented differences across the psychological and developmental variables as well as in the time spent on Facebook. Results evidenced an association between a more problematic Facebook use and a lack of interpersonal competence offline, in terms of the ability to provide emotional support and to manage conflicts. Adolescents with a more problematic Facebook use reported higher alienation to peers, lower levels of emotional stability and lower levels of openness to experience. Discussion will highlight the developmental context of more and less adaptive ways of using Facebook.","['Raquel Assunção', 'Paula Mena Matos']",4796f79e-dd7b-4b15-8833-6a7c3a8f0458,0,"['07038c6f-31ef-4475-92c7-d04d2e406280', '0b15571e-513c-4a7a-8c60-c0d98feb2797', '0d4b80cf-2357-46e7-90fa-8cdda943c314', '1396060d-d766-41d5-9ccd-437ed8274203', '13afec05-66c2-4c99-b1fc-6d4a6a64f9f9', '41653a32-d24b-4e0e-b9b3-f6144693388b', '4b983058-b288-47fb-b0f2-c1be12b8f9d7', '5d265a80-3160-41e4-8b72-5f987281924d', '6bf61f97-b92d-4fba-a7d8-67b3349f0c24', '7b77ee70-78ee-498a-a53c-d4c50ad5b1b7', '87ccb2b3-3c65-4532-b61c-141694e78d71', 'd0265304-656d-4730-a766-1c6029f1b22c', 'd3c9cebe-a365-49dd-8379-f165cfea843e', 'ed753404-f0ba-4ff9-a977-e47c07a2dde6', 'f419c340-4d4d-4bd3-8af1-e517e2a796ec']",Adolescents' profiles of problematic Facebook use and associations with developmental variables,Computers in Human Behavior,2017
1362,"Orthology characterizes genes of different organisms that arose from a single ancestral gene via speciation, in contrast to paralogy, which is assigned to genes that arose via gene duplication. An accurate orthology assignment is a crucial step for comparative genomic studies. Orthologous genes in two organisms can be identified by applying a so-called reciprocal search strategy, given that complete information of the organisms’ gene repertoire is available. In many investigations, however, only a fraction of the gene content of the organisms under study is examined (e.g., RNA sequencing). Here, identification of orthologous nucleotide or amino acid sequences can be achieved using a graph-based approach that maps nucleotide sequences to genes of known orthology. Existing implementations of this approach, however, suffer from algorithmic issues that may cause problems in downstream analyses. We present a new software pipeline, Orthograph, that addresses and solves the above problems and implements useful features for a wide range of comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses. Orthograph applies a best reciprocal hit search strategy using profile hidden Markov models and maps nucleotide sequences to the globally best matching cluster of orthologous genes, thus enabling researchers to conveniently and reliably delineate orthologs and paralogs from transcriptomic and genomic sequence data. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on de novo-sequenced and assembled transcript libraries of 24 species of apoid wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) as well as on published genomic datasets. With Orthograph, we implemented a best reciprocal hit approach to reference-based orthology prediction for coding nucleotide sequences such as RNAseq data. Orthograph is flexible, easy to use, open source and freely available at #N#                    https://mptrsen.github.io/Orthograph#N#                    #N#                  .

1363,"The control of product quality of complex chemical processes strictly depends on the measure of the key process variables. However, the online measure device is extremely expensive, and these devices are hard to protect. Meanwhile, there is a delay for these online measure devices. Therefore, the soft sensor technology plays a vital role in measuring the key process variables. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an efficient and simple single layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs) to building an exact soft sensor model. However, unsuitable selected hidden nodes and random parameters will greatly affect the performance of the ELM. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Self-Organizing Extreme Learning Machine (SOELM) algorithm constructed by the biological neuron-glia interaction principle to solve the issue of the ELM. Firstly, the weights between input layer nodes and the CNS are tuned iteratively by the Hebbian learning rule. Then the network structure is adjusted self-organizing by Mutual Information (MI) among different structures of networks. Secondly, the weights between the CNS and output layer nodes are obtained by the ELM. The experimental results based on different UCI data sets prove that the SOELM has a better generalization capability and stability than that of the ELM. Moreover, our proposed method is developed as a soft sensor model for accurately predicting the key variables of the Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) process.","['Zhiqiang Geng', 'Jungen Dong', 'Jie Chen', 'Yongming Han']",f2a09768-940e-4f2a-bb16-cfb9a46520a1,0,"['12b0ee2b-2691-43d3-b58c-2250dfc39986', '1db171ec-e0e1-4d80-96dc-96d7583cbe72', '299768a9-faac-4b15-a6ed-9654c87d74bc', '2a031bae-0550-4509-974d-4db6a35c77de', '2d3abcf3-6eea-4374-9c7f-7b2dea8c3cea', '33493f42-0b0b-4f75-8a38-a480e98f13cd', '33abc1fc-50ea-4837-a4a0-65c1d4c0e0b7', '35a1b0ae-7029-4e70-9ba1-f97a99183b46', '3624a88f-b2ce-4148-aa57-1f3e68e3835d', '45d52503-b184-4cc9-b8ad-4872b80e2f63', '4c4f6d24-6d5b-4220-bf9b-1f014b91cec7', '524b2d33-2fa5-460b-a5b9-ffd4b2e90168', '64855a0b-8393-4875-adfc-c9c637ba563a', '75067405-4fff-47e0-b0cc-5612b93b064d', '8789c872-6a20-4a4b-88c9-e769ab7fe1e0', '96d9df3f-43c4-4fdd-b82e-f42c135b8ea4', '9c3a8bee-5f3f-4525-a92b-ce3a9d013195', 'b438184d-ce7b-494d-bf12-e9e75c0fdb5c', 'b61d41ce-6ccd-43a1-a883-9ab1b2f2e794', 'c7767d5c-7b9d-4edc-8042-f9212c9d5c0a', 'cee8f741-5e2d-43c0-b9bd-b2d2bce2e5e8', 'd38a0f21-a1fb-4393-8f94-41af93b7995b', 'db653e7b-7722-443e-9a27-b0c40011367f', 'e2a058f8-577a-40fa-9a36-5872090dfe97', 'fc27e8d1-4d2a-48ff-b78e-1fd873393f0c']",A new Self-Organizing Extreme Learning Machine soft sensor model and its applications in complicated chemical processes,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2017

The essential unknowns render the existing compensation strategies inapplicable and motivate us to explore a new one. First, a time-varying strategy is developed to compensate the essential unknowns, where a suitable design function of time is introduced so that the unknowns can be overtaken by the design function as time increases. Then, distributed time-varying consensus protocols are designed and the leader-following consensus is achieved. When essential time-variations exist, the designed consensus protocols are still valid if the involved design function of time is replaced by a new one. Two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.","['Xinglong Niu', 'Yungang Liu', 'Yongchao Man']",efbb6fd2-996a-419d-aa56-d8121a076126,0,"['059f3519-bf97-4a76-877d-8df4b2a48815', '0a2fb83a-a309-4b3b-a0d8-c810b328f414', '1a06324a-1b71-4d50-854e-0d16392ca2b9', '20f69979-25a8-406b-addd-02942597233f', '2768199c-b9d6-4001-94d3-e6429c93bc5f', '29c8b9a2-0701-4626-be72-ce1b5eddb584', '31db2c55-f3cc-41ce-823a-311fb46003f8', '3606ad6a-aadc-41a2-ad0a-c50f232ff7cd', '363975b2-4a39-42c2-99de-ba32feae7bd1', '3cbcc779-9559-48f0-9ca8-97401d922f90', '492bae4b-a43e-46d3-b1a1-0ecd273b41d3', '53973789-e531-4ced-86aa-3cc11229021b', '55fa3ee3-d7dd-47b8-9c01-be723dca8142', '5d72cff1-68a6-4aa3-ac3b-0907e3ee1b32', '7289238f-9c8e-4796-a04a-d842c2615602', 'b3331168-2fa8-44ee-b9eb-0742e8d4a849', 'b8cf3f3a-e83a-43d1-9851-44888f218f4f', 'bf7b41a7-fa7a-49ce-81b3-eaab4a84e492', 'e3118eba-3c0f-4443-a009-e895c3265f46', 'e35ef391-411e-4b67-a7ba-5caf41325a44', 'e97e2902-1d9c-4d0c-8e37-7d702d87fb5e']",Consensus via time-varying feedback for uncertain nonlinear multi-agent systems with rather coarse input disturbances ☆,Systems & Control Letters,2017
1365,"Recently, fast Fourier transform filter-bank multicarrier (FFT-FBMC) modulation was proposed to enable diverse multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques with FBMC by eliminating the intrinsic interference. A per-subcarrier (PSC) channel equalizer was derived under the assumption of low frequency selectivity. However, this equalization scheme cannot be directly applied to highly frequency selective channels without performance degradation. In this letter, we analyze the received signal after demodulation without any assumption on the channel selectivity. We develop a general closed-form expression for the equivalent channel seen at the demodulator. Furthermore, we design the associate channel equalizer. Simulation results demonstrate that the developed equalizer performs as equally with the previous PSC equalizer in the case of low frequency selectivity, and outperforms the PSC equalizer in highly frequency selective channels.","['Rostom Zakaria', 'Didier Le Ruyet']",43232efb-6269-4edd-b4b0-02be7d3c9511,0,"['4261f011-5000-4840-a09a-4ca24df22a15', 'a37a2c38-1bfc-4e8f-afdf-f250ce83edad', 'a82f8a1d-d024-4819-85e7-2106b0ae31fd', 'af1ecae7-d059-4f98-8c99-80651890652d', 'd5b59e64-fb0d-4875-906d-1f3ad72f7f9e']",Analysis of the FFT-FBMC Equalization in Selective Channels,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,2017
1366,"Exploratory Testing technique is well applicable to software development projects, where test basis is not available (or at least not complete and consistent to the extent allowing the creation of efficient test cases). The key factor for the efficiency of this technique is a structured process for the recording of explored path in the system under test. This approach also allows the creation of the test cases during exploratory testing process. These test cases can be used in the following re-testing of the system. If performed manually, the efficiency of such process strongly depends on the team organization and systematic work of the individuals in the team. This process can be aided by an automated support. In the paper, a framework, which automatically records selected tester’s actions in the system under test is presented. From these recordings, a model of the screen and action flows is reengineered and test cases are prepared. Tester is also able to define more meta-data in the test cases during this process. The recorded model and defined test cases are then available for the next rounds of testing. The performed case study shows that Exploratory Testing aided by this machine support is less resource demanding than Exploratory Testing performed manually only. Also, larger part of SUT was explored during the tests, when this systematic support was available to testers.","['Karel Frajtak', 'Miroslav Bures', 'Ivan Jelinek']",a2fafd6e-7053-4a4e-82b2-ce448395e762,0,"['0fd1b808-1264-41f4-bed7-a2c92bda911e', '14e3e5ef-f2b8-4ba3-a815-eb6f657c49a8', '1f9e3649-d54b-4cdd-8c46-9b4d7cdbc487', '5d1eeffb-0b19-4b6d-9b64-bf3870d3954a', '622609cf-fae8-4fd4-a021-989a064dd77d', '6abcc7f8-e3df-486c-9162-804dcf92c4ed', '7eea79cf-67dc-4d80-9ede-a6ddff40bb6d', '8869111c-bce5-4958-aae0-bd0b6c87354e', '9250f7d9-8e68-47dc-9c0b-115978659672', '9d437b21-34b4-4ecf-a97c-44f03f6c44d5', 'ca5dae67-ea18-4432-ad5d-093edc6b2734', 'dc41ec96-5232-409a-b19f-27cc5dbf7c56', 'dee25b34-c744-45d1-8517-425b99bed452', 'e8cf1f04-c4c0-4d63-9877-f8bcbec03e95']",Exploratory testing supported by automated reengineering of model of the system under test,Cluster Computing,2017
1367,"Voice over IP VoIP is increasingly replacing the old public switched telephone network PSTN technology. In this new scenario, there are several challenges for VoIP providers. First, VoIP requires a detailed monitoring of both users' quality of service QoS and experience QoE to a greater extent than in traditional PSTNs. Second, such a monitoring process must be able to track VoIP traffic in high-speed networks, nowadays typically of multi-Gb/s rates. Third, recent government directives require that providers retain information from their users' calls. Similarly, the convergence of data and voice services allows operators to provide new services such as full-data retention, in which users' calls can be recorded for either quality assessment call centers, QoE or security purposes lawful interception. This implies a significant investment in infrastructure, especially in large-scale networks which require multiple points of measurement and redundancy. This paper proposes a novel methodology, architecture and system to fulfill such challenges, called VoIPCallMon, as well as the data structures and necessary hardware-tuning knowledge for its development. As distinguishing features, VoIPCallMon provides very high performance, being able to process VoIP traffic on-the-fly at high bitrates, novel services and significant cost reduction by using commodity hardware with minimal interference with operational VoIP networks. The performance evaluation shows that the system copes with the VoIP load of real-world operators.

1368,"ABSTRACTMore complex problems of simultaneous position and internal force control occur with cooperative manipulator systems than that of a single one. In the presence of unwanted parametric and modelling uncertainties as well as external disturbances, a decentralised position synchronised force control scheme is proposed. With a feedforward neural network estimating engine, a precise model of the system dynamics is not required. Unlike conventional cooperative or synchronised controllers, virtual position and virtual synchronisation errors are introduced for internal force tracking control and task space position synchronisation. Meanwhile joint space synchronisation and force measurement are unnecessary. Together with simulation studies and analysis, the position and the internal force errors are shown to asymptotically converge to zero. Moreover, the controller exhibits different characteristics with selected synchronisation factors. Under certain settings, it can deal with temporary cooperation by an ...","['Jin Wang', 'Fan Xu', 'Guodong Lu']",b5a8ea3b-16fc-4a61-ad12-c1381829b701,0,"['030348f5-104c-4663-ab53-1fd3f80807cd', '16e7a506-f4a9-48f1-87b9-12c1cfac2161', '1afd8dc3-698c-418e-9aa0-567fae43c65b', '31eeb590-bda5-486a-afc0-2f01d38c446b', '3586ea98-e372-408e-90f1-af9761f06aa6', '3b939907-d596-4223-b1f2-b54a8e259d0d', '3cafe693-7b06-4491-982f-b137f4fb59fa', '5ebd7d2a-0b25-4fc1-91d6-d76cdaab935d', '618f8331-1a8a-43d5-9eb1-275cfe5e72fc', '756632e8-e96e-4a84-980f-926635d0eb62', '7582cc45-4396-4828-b15e-e827344c874f', '92a9f5e7-6b70-4eee-9e51-00386fb090a6', '9bb54600-d054-4d6c-a49d-89e853281eb6', '9c354b01-eb31-4b8a-aeed-7d9bed050254', 'a5200eed-f670-45db-89b5-bebefd695b2f', 'ae412cd5-9fa2-4c15-87c9-e9c8df23811d', 'b6c0f6ed-33be-46d3-91c3-7f2e08598685', 'cc6c710d-48ea-4720-8de5-04550f8bba98', 'd3820e97-cae3-4108-99b2-ce2ec4a3941f', 'eef14e9b-fc6a-4ca0-a206-43f42fd5d017', 'f073e808-0778-4132-9321-f9d1689db1de', 'f890ed8b-2892-40af-b7e1-eccc2ca53884']",Neural network-based position synchronised internal force control scheme for cooperative manipulator system,International Journal of Systems Science,2017

1371,"This paper aims at proposing an efficient and versatile application of Petri nets (PNs) either alone without global positioning system (GPS) as in (GPS-free) system or together with the navigation system (GPS-registered) to conveniently provide a proper energy management strategy for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) of high hybridization level and serial architecture. A comparison between the PN strategy and two fuzzy logic strategies is performed in terms of fuel consumption and convergence time. In this paper, short and long trip types of 30 km mainly urban and 240 km mostly highway are considered with an initial state of charge (SoC) of 50% and different daily driving cycles or various standard the New York City Cycle, the New European Driving Cycle, US06 driving cycles. Both kinds of battery management strategies, GPS-free and GPS registered, are demonstrated and compared through simulation studies using the MTCsim software. Dealing with both types of trips, the simulation results significantly illustrate the superiority of the novel GPS-registered methodology’s efficiency toward improving the HEV’s energy management and reducing its fuel consumption besides the relative economic feasibility and structural simplicity features. Over one week duration, the GPS allows reaching the desired final SoC with acceptable errors and reducing the fuel consumption for both daily short and weekend long trips. The originality of this paper is proposing a hybrid GPS/rule-based approach to reduce the fuel consumption during daily driving trips that present about half of the professional travels in 2008 according to the French Sustainable Development Division. This novel strategy is developed on the basis of the recorded GPS data from past trips and the batteries’ final recharging capacities.","['H.S. Ramadan', 'M.

1372,"Complexities in the full genome expression studies hinder the extraction of tracker genes to analyze the course of biological events. In this study, we demonstrate the applications of supervised machine learning methods to reduce the irrelevance in microarray data series and thereby extract robust molecular markers to track biological processes. The methodology has been illustrated by analyzing whole genome expression studies on bone-implant integration (ossointegration). Being a biological process, osseointegration is known to leave a trail of genetic footprint during the course. In spite of existence of enormous amount of raw data in public repositories, researchers still do not have access to a panel of genes that can definitively track osseointegration. The results from our study revealed panels comprising of matrix metalloproteinases and collagen genes were able to track osseointegration on implant surfaces (MMP9 and COL1A2 on micro-textured; MMP12 and COL6A3 on superimposed nano-textured surfaces) with 100% classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Further, our analysis showed the importance of the progression of the duration in establishment of the mechanical connection at bone-implant surface. The findings from this study are expected to be useful to researchers investigating osseointegration of novel implant materials especially at the early stage. The methodology demonstrated can be easily adapted by scientists in different fields to analyze large databases for other biological processes.","['Anwesha Barik', 'Satarupa Banerjee', 'Santanu Dhara', 'Nishant Chakravorty']",24faaa9a-fb25-48b7-b425-3682ee866414,0,"['057e0cad-8791-43b5-8368-2b0a111c3dce', '20f6b6aa-4215-4d2c-8b2a-c47ff184a064', '30115d13-47c4-4b56-a55b-ef4d68d8cde0', '32188d3b-49dc-4cd0-bd73-0801b21c4509', '4e232b2d-6427-4fee-a454-abd881e33885', '8c474c0f-9306-408c-baac-64e2638d27e2', 'afcece9a-52fb-456c-b9bc-3c7ed40d21b6', 'b9c6d541-952a-4f63-8f6c-afeffaaa3a4f', 'ce83a780-4f93-4b3a-9647-ec62834541dd']",A reductionist approach to extract robust molecular markers from microarray data series – Isolating markers to track osseointegration,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,2017
1373,"Vegetation indices derived from satellite image time series have been extensively used to estimate the timing of phenological events like season onset. Medium spatial resolution (≥250 m) satellite sensors with daily revisit capability are typically employed for this purpose. In recent years, phenology is being retrieved at higher resolution (≤30 m) in response to increasing availability of high-resolution satellite data. To overcome the reduced acquisition frequency of such data, previous attempts involved fusion between high- and medium-resolution data, or combinations of multi-year acquisitions in a single phenological reconstruction. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that phenological parameters can now be retrieved from single-season high-resolution time series, and to compare these retrievals against those derived from multi-year high-resolution and single-season medium-resolution satellite data. The study focuses on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which comprises a highly-dynamic saltmarsh, dune vegetation, and agricultural land. Combining NDVI series derived from atmospherically-corrected images from RapidEye (5 m-resolution) and the SPOT5 Take5 experiment (10m-resolution) acquired between March and August 2015, phenological parameters were estimated using a function fitting approach. We then compared results with phenology retrieved from four years of 30 m Landsat 8 OLI data, and single-year 100 m Proba-V and 250 m MODIS temporal composites of the same period. Retrieved phenological parameters from combined RapidEye/SPOT5 displayed spatially consistent results and a large spatial variability, providing complementary information to existing vegetation community maps. Retrievals that combined four years of Landsat observations into a single synthetic year were affected by the inclusion of years with warmer spring temperatures, whereas adjustment of the average phenology to 2015 observations was only feasible for a few pixels due to cloud cover around phenological transition dates. The Proba-V and MODIS phenology retrievals scaled poorly relative to their high-resolution equivalents, indicating that medium-resolution phenology retrievals need to be interpreted with care, particularly in landscapes with fine-scale land cover variability.","['Anton Vrieling', 'Andrew K.

State-of-the-art algorithms struggle to find optimal solutions for real-world sized pre-marshalling problems. To this end, we introduce an improved exact algorithm using an iterative deepening branch and bound search, including a novel lower bound computation, a new branching heuristic, new dominance rule and a new greedy partial solution completion heuristic. Our approach finds optimal solutions for 161 more instances than the state-of-the-art algorithm on two well known, difficult pre-marshalling datasets, and solves all instances in three other datasets in just several seconds. Furthermore, we find optimal solutions for a majority of real-world sized instances, and feasible solutions with very low relaxation gaps on those instances where no optimal could be found.","['Shunji Tanaka', 'Kevin Tierney']",0aafec42-f785-4b31-bbf4-ca9e2b0f3161,0,"['04c097f6-5d6b-41d4-af73-1df9aa2206b5', '070882bd-2b09-4399-b79d-b6ac21d48221', '0fab054a-b724-490b-a836-3bf4a5c86170', '14a7c9cf-c176-4b1c-8b79-2f22db37c8ae', '15ba637e-80b9-40c0-80ae-e3d3850dceeb', '1842780e-dc29-4b29-9b43-32616bbf22cc', '4d95399a-35a0-4379-9aba-425b8e970df6', '4fcd2867-38b3-4912-bf01-369f160211de', '645eecf9-aa11-4903-b0ee-64e4b5296f93', '68792bd8-d822-4e61-a3cf-d791075ef5af', '755e5403-56fa-418a-92c6-0d795d99f57d', '8c37deba-7def-4a64-85cb-c4e89cf61bb7', '8f3ab3fc-76d9-4baf-bf26-0e4e56997079', '9936fd11-851b-4533-a250-79939f3096b5', '9cc92c59-4077-42b7-9d8d-b8fb48bf6dff', '9e961626-2b39-4846-9708-41e2474f1ff6', '9eac8ddd-7b7b-4af9-af7e-b7f118f44b9f', 'a8f0ebbc-325b-46f7-8494-81c6d4934494', 'b05fb25f-c903-4d20-b203-75a849eb73de', 'ca027b85-3f52-46e6-8553-a3bf613d6d80', 'cec5b99a-5233-4289-ac89-f97dd11b4e33', 'e2c2a0a4-3d76-46a9-90c3-e34c6f0d7faa', 'e2cc17a1-ad40-482e-ad8b-d2b04f5b0b53', 'e7ae243a-6c45-4a6e-b9d9-92e0924c8e7b', 'fbf0544b-3d85-402e-9c1d-3c1dcf45180c']",Solving real-world sized container pre-marshalling problems with an iterative deepening branch-and-bound algorithm,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
1375,"ABSTRACTKernel density estimation (KDE) is a classic approach for spatial point pattern analysis. In many applications, KDE with spatially adaptive bandwidths (adaptive KDE) is preferred over KDE with an invariant bandwidth (fixed KDE). However, bandwidths determination for adaptive KDE is extremely computationally intensive, particularly for point pattern analysis tasks of large problem sizes. This computational challenge impedes the application of adaptive KDE to analyze large point data sets, which are common in this big data era. This article presents a graphics processing units (GPUs)-accelerated adaptive KDE algorithm for efficient spatial point pattern analysis on spatial big data. First, optimizations were designed to reduce the algorithmic complexity of the bandwidth determination algorithm for adaptive KDE.

RAPID is used to generate a lookup table of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) elements required by VLIDORT for the surface boundary condition. To test the RAPID–VLIDORT model, we used five natural 3-D scenes along with five aerosol optical depths (AODs). Results for top-of-atmosphere radiances show semiempirical analytical BRDF models are insufficiently accurate to represent bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) in hotspot regions and over wide angular variations.

1377,"In recent years, pixel value ordering based reversible data hiding has become a hot research topic for its high-fidelity. In this approach, only the maximum and minimum of pixel block are predicted and modified to embed data and the preservation of pixel values order guarantees the reversibility. So far, the optimal block size can only be exhaustively searched until Wang et al. propose the dynamic blocking strategy which enables the combination of two various-sized blocks. By further dividing flat block into four sub-blocks to retain larger embedding capacity, dynamic blocking can employ less high complexity blocks for a given embedding capacity. However, the lack of host image dependent automatic block classification mechanism still exposes the fact that their work is far from efficient and comprehensive. In this paper, to address this drawback and to better exploit image redundancy, a really efficient and more comprehensive blocking strategy namely multistage blocking is proposed. High efficiency lies in prediction accuracy matrix based thresholds determination, which enables infinitely extended multistage blocking in theory. The superiority of the proposed scheme is also experimentally verified.","['Wenguang He', 'Jie Cai', 'Ke Zhou', 'Gangqiang Xiong']",6406a690-436c-4f15-931d-daa7968ace71,0,"['13a27d6b-b36d-4760-86b4-e6fa6d4f9730', '15a1f406-81cb-4fb9-9f26-9808b7b45ce6', '19a79a56-d656-4971-9543-b41647042ecd', '1d833a0e-78dd-4cf5-a222-67727108326d', '25e93616-7343-4136-be26-1bd981e1b7e1', '2e6fd869-7a4f-4730-94aa-02a73e7a6cef', '340bc8d4-0a3b-42dc-bd1c-e9157973505d', '35415ca1-7c6a-4415-868c-717414173f60', '43dc825b-4ea4-47ec-90f0-b29b990cc0b1', '4847a6de-8ddc-47a5-8201-c45aabb870de', '5c323ed2-22a1-4844-8673-bfdf4eacbcba', '8513208d-29a8-4566-b0f5-df055d1dc3a8', '8b29cd82-9434-4618-9330-886b81b33cc4', '93b7ea0c-2493-43a6-86f4-c9a6361fd7b0', '94f99e5e-7430-4986-9727-74dc538f5b3c', 'a1dcca18-f99b-4f37-9b47-68e794a5029a', 'ab4c0d0a-4b79-4558-89c7-cd0823a3b1d6', 'b5ff0abf-1959-4c04-a375-364730a1d916', 'b721cea8-5434-4328-865f-30a0d46aa0ec', 'b7f636a0-c226-4e1b-a4f2-e06b3067974b', 'c5987846-7ee8-4fba-a70b-34de394e05b8', 'c7020ea8-6629-4c16-825a-f1225fcdb7ef', 'cf5a90a5-3e81-4488-9180-fa6a791e2016', 'd3b2585a-ff83-4c61-b242-1825b34c4156', 'db6ab201-0fdc-45da-8c04-80e7c69b931c', 'eb0f1aff-d8dd-4c52-8a65-3d0d58f4c8ca']",Efficient PVO-based reversible data hiding using multistage blocking and prediction accuracy matrix ☆,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017
1378,"ABSTRACTOver two decades after the scholarly interventions that coalesced into ‘critical GIS’ as a field within GIScience, critical GIS remains underdeveloped in conversations on teaching and learning. The literature on GIScience education has emphasized content more than pedagogies – what to teach versus how to teach to move students toward particular learning objectives. This emphasis is reflected in dominant curricular approaches to critical GIS, in which questions around the complicated origins and complicit social, political, and economic relationships of GIS are taken up as discrete topics, tacked onto instruction that otherwise prioritizes technical dimensions of GIScience. We argue that GIScience coursework must resist such modularization by approaching critical GIS not as a set of topics, but an orientation to GIS praxis that ‘does’ GIS from within a questioning stance, to ask how we know. We outline specific curricular shifts and teaching practices we have used to foster this orientation in GIS ...","['Sarah Elwood', 'Matthew W.

1379,"Microbiome studies commonly use 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize microbial communities. Errors introduced at multiple steps in this process can affect the interpretation of the data. Here we evaluate the accuracy of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) generation, taxonomic classification, alpha- and beta-diversity measures for different settings in QIIME, MOTHUR and a pplacer-based classification pipeline, using a novel software package: DECARD. In-silico we generated 100 synthetic bacterial communities approximating human stool microbiomes to be used as a gold-standard for evaluating the colligative performance of microbiome analysis software. Our synthetic data closely matched the composition and complexity of actual healthy human stool microbiomes. Genus-level taxonomic classification was correctly done for only 50.4–74.8% of the source organisms. Miscall rates varied from 11.9 to 23.5%. Species-level classification was less successful, (6.9–18.9% correct); miscall rates were comparable to those of genus-level targets (12.5–26.2%). The degree of miscall varied by clade of organism, pipeline and specific settings used. OTU generation accuracy varied by strategy (closed, de novo or subsampling), reference database, algorithm and software implementation. Shannon diversity estimation accuracy correlated generally with OTU-generation accuracy. Beta-diversity estimates with Double Principle Coordinate Analysis (DPCoA) were more robust against errors introduced in processing than Weighted UniFrac. The settings suggested in the tutorials were among the worst performing in all outcomes tested. Even when using the same classification pipeline, the specific OTU-generation strategy, reference database and downstream analysis methods selection can have a dramatic effect on the accuracy of taxonomic classification, and alpha- and beta-diversity estimation. Even minor changes in settings adversely affected the accuracy of the results, bringing them far from the best-observed result. Thus, specific details of how a pipeline is used (including OTU generation strategy, reference sets, clustering algorithm and specific software implementation) should be specified in the methods section of all microbiome studies. Researchers should evaluate their chosen pipeline and settings to confirm it can adequately answer the research question rather than assuming the tutorial or standard-operating-procedure settings will be adequate or optimal.","['Jonathan L.

1380,"The BLSTM classifier has been recently introduced for sequence labeling tasks and provides state-of-the-art performance for handwriting recognition. Its recurrent connections integrate the context at the feature level over a long range. Nevertheless, this context is not explicitly modeled at the label level. Explicit context-modeling strategies have been applied to HMMs with improvement of the recognition rate. In this paper, we study the effect of context modeling on the performance of the BLSTM classifier. The baseline approach, consisting of context-independent character label, is compared with several context-dependent approaches, modeling the left and right contexts. The results show that context-dependent models improve the recognition rate, and demonstrate the ability of the BLSTM classifier to deal with a large number of character models, without clustering. Furthermore, the context-dependent and context-independent models are complementary, and their combination leads to a robust recognition. We tested our approach with promising results on the RIMES database of Latin script documents.","['Youssouf Chherawala', 'Partha Roy', 'Mohamed Cheriet']",d7c29fdf-638f-4dbc-9d27-ed547551c2eb,0,"['12307651-5384-4b1f-9487-b77059dc55eb', '12bd534e-eafd-4228-b09e-a129d00a48d0', '2607bbc8-6bf7-430f-87bf-1be86a525262', '3d3845ff-0ca1-43a5-adfa-80c542d3cd66', '546cc930-3d5a-4208-a77b-a506f146ab97', '54a3b4f6-4605-40e3-b684-d1a649c54fa9', '58d4b606-0020-4756-99d2-3d5685264e6a', '5a15cd27-79a6-4e8e-a495-86beaa8a2c80', '6b98c345-4d55-4aff-91c0-847595815468', '8f4ac28c-1b1d-4ce2-934f-13df8120ea2c', '942355c9-8ee4-4b98-a7e8-ffef645ef769', '9c48780e-b78f-4c30-bea3-73b6dea44028', 'a04592f9-9ff7-4c5d-951a-f946b826073b', 'bfd3ed16-d660-42ca-bcd8-29ed2e0f2463', 'c02a091c-369b-4e6d-a827-e29dbfa93917', 'c288f70f-f417-4a96-8528-25c61372cae7', 'ca1db977-6543-4b6f-bcd5-5a24ef11fd20', 'cea868b1-b7f8-4bb6-aec5-7caa5ceea3f0', 'e069b46d-6edb-417b-8fb9-21c5652dbd1c', 'e72f8e15-413a-4cbd-bffa-f44b9388015f', 'f54624cc-30ea-4a27-b2ba-f91781cbcb22', 'fb78e3c4-11f1-4366-8c02-b6decd16a8ca']",Combination of context-dependent bidirectional long short-term memory classifiers for robust offline handwriting recognition,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017
1381,"We present a strongly-coupled immersed-boundary method for flow–structure interaction problems involving thin deforming bodies. The method is stable for arbitrary choices of solid-to-fluid mass ratios and for large body motions. As with many strongly-coupled immersed-boundary methods, our method requires the solution of a nonlinear algebraic system at each time step. The system is solved through iteration, where the iterates are obtained by linearizing the system and performing a block-LU factorization. This restricts all iterations to small-dimensional subsystems that scale with the number of discretization points on the immersed surface, rather than on the entire flow domain. Moreover, the iteration procedure we propose does not involve heuristic regularization parameters, and has converged in a small number of iterations for all problems we have considered. We derive our method for general deforming surfaces, and verify the method with two-dimensional test problems of geometrically nonlinear flags undergoing large amplitude flapping behavior.","['Andres Goza', 'Tim Colonius']",4ceb1bd6-c670-42d8-8413-4867c1128827,0,"['0231efcf-678d-4bd6-9695-d46f3f7118b6', '02ced4ef-c4d5-4862-ad92-ebdc686e02b6', '1a261a25-b286-435a-95e2-adbea5316d5b', '21560d7b-80aa-40cc-8757-ddd4334a4b9c', '408051d2-f6e3-454a-bdaa-9b6619baa336', '5403693b-6cfb-41bc-b14d-e1eecc941785', '6d22a50d-09c1-43a2-8223-c88bcb843983', '75634bd6-dd25-4d7b-a439-da2349e4e352', '88567d87-33a0-48c1-8ad9-7316814febad', 'a2ac1e03-ee74-4605-bb12-892e08dacc9c', 'e7b12306-c3b1-4761-a6ed-37e5468b3f1b', 'f0378576-71cd-49ff-920d-d5a0da891d7e']",A strongly-coupled immersed-boundary formulation for thin elastic structures,Journal of Computational Physics,2017

In this paper, we tackle the single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times with the objective of minimizing the weighted tardiness. To solve this problem, we propose a scatter search algorithm which uses path relinking in its core. This algorithm is enhanced with some procedures to speed-up the neighbors’ evaluation and with some diversification and intensification techniques, the latter taking some elements from iterated local search. We conducted an experimental study across a well-known set of instances to analyze the contribution of each component to the overall performance of the algorithm, as well as to compare our proposal with the state-of-the-art metaheuristics, obtaining competitive results. We also propose a new benchmark with larger and more challenging instances and provide the first results for them.","['Miguel A. González', 'Juan José Palacios', 'Camino R.

In that context, accurately understanding the state of development of technology convergence and forecasting promising technology convergence can determine the success of a firm. However, previous studies have mainly focused on examining the convergence paths taken in the past or the current state of convergence rather than projecting the future trends of convergence. In addition, few studies have dealt with multi-technology convergence by taking a pairwise-analysis approach. Therefore, this research aimed to propose a forecasting methodology for multi-technology convergence, which is more realistic than pairwise convergence, based on a patent-citation analysis, a dependency-structure matrix, and a neural-network analysis. The suggested methodology enables both researchers and practitioners in the convergence field to plan their technology development by forecasting the technology combination that will occur in the future.","['Jee-Eun Kim', 'Sungjoo Lee']",10b3bbab-42fe-45e1-ab69-068d823811bc,0,"['1661aa83-dc52-4c25-9e6e-9c22ffeefa3a', '22ac3021-43f8-406d-8016-51da67f112e8', '25708b21-d239-45c1-ae5b-6167151bbd2d', '57e6a24b-34cd-4007-96fa-5ed77b04e417', '7866b827-d2bb-4536-b322-83a0473c0487', '95e8a569-bb8d-416b-aa27-0d3f3df92f6c', '99689cf4-272d-4b72-b01d-2085773d4b07', 'f5f3fb99-fad1-4bd7-bcde-a3b233bf2430']",Forecasting and identifying multi-technology convergence based on patent data: the case of IT and BT industries in 2020,Scientometrics,2017
1384,"Identification and authentication are ubiquitous questions which pan across various systems. In certain domains, they are of paramount importance. Like, security forces deploy various human identifications systems to discern potential wrongdoers. They constitute a vital part of various government social welfare schemes. The efficacy of the schemes is greatly impacted by them. Being pervasive and eminent, they demand more dedicated and focused research. Now-a-days, most of the systems incorporate a biometric system to address identification and authentication. The biometric system employs disparate traits like face, signature, iris, fingerprint, palmprint, speech, etc. for identification and authentication. A biometric trait must possess the following fundamental aspects; It should be able to identify an individual uniquely. For an individual, it should be consistent. To acquire it should be easy, cost-effective, time-efficient and automated. On such account, fingerprint trait is of outstanding merit. It has been widely studied and is an integral part of the many present biometric systems. However, fingerprints are subject to occupational hazard. The fingerprint is of abysmal quality for hand labourer, blacksmith, etc. due to the nature of their work. If a fingerprint based biometric system has a large number of such users then its precision is greatly affected. In such scenario, an alternate is to use finger-knuckle-print which possess almost comparable feature as fingerprint while being unaffected by such occupational hazards. In this paper, we propose a novel finger-knuckle-print based biometric system which could be deployed where a large number of user base is rural. Initially, ROI of finger knuckle image has been extracted, enhanced and transformed using the proposed Bubble ordinal pattern (BOP), STAR ordinal pattern (SOP), and Image ray transform (IRT) based locally adapted procedures. A novel DeepMatching technique has been used to perform non-rigid distortion free matching between multiple features of two Finger Knuckle Images (FKI). Finally, the performance of proposed system has been evaluated using score level fusion rule, revealing improvement in the results.","['Gaurav Jaswal', 'Aditya Nigam', 'Ravinder Nath']",29cb5ef5-514b-4e5a-9034-04858e827c7c,0,"['032badec-86ec-42fc-8c5f-5aa3c3014f59', '0bd2e31c-50a3-48fa-8f0f-48cdec3a62c2', '2138eb45-fb79-41aa-b63c-214362aed03e', '36a2fe99-308c-4970-95c8-6f03e02ee4d9', '3f8baa25-4805-4fe0-bfea-2293f7e72b06', '4f3b5bd2-1178-43be-99e0-e81c286847f9', '53ef2383-c205-4ce2-b55b-9ef42c41791e', '5bfc0fd4-be05-4c18-bb5a-31b8b6028c8a', '6b0556b8-e1d6-4016-ab08-e36f845ebc05', '6ef137fc-27e8-443e-9141-7ab63b0ff3cf', '7c94542e-8de7-4e7a-8094-3871bf5d6c76', '7eb8fe29-385f-49e0-b4fa-cd106d2cf763', '7f298a90-821a-4edc-90e4-041fe40cfccf', '80ba825d-df38-409e-88e3-534f28285316', '86fefda3-efad-4a80-8ac9-d3cdf07b94b1', '976c4962-f8c9-40f1-8888-777f5199861d', '985849ec-22a8-4420-8ab0-c97f3fc27f43', 'b1ab1f98-c1de-498d-987e-5e73f7b1e850', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'c355c204-1505-4ee4-a692-2dbc693af5bb', 'cd189d19-27d8-4e71-b68e-b4052fb41284', 'cfa7a1a9-c890-4243-b84a-50b1d47a6aac', 'd82b3b18-a757-4386-841a-51d6638058bc', 'dd6ee287-e0c3-4587-898c-a0c43873f6fb', 'e3a5cec9-7e82-4c14-86ab-0d95a92712a7', 'ebbc86bc-db8b-4f6b-8bac-17331f999f48', 'f9cf0c20-f55b-4ed7-b5bd-7139ff34a60a', 'ffa725d2-7538-4f0d-a353-06b3e91951df']",DeepKnuckle: revealing the human identity,Multimedia Tools and Applications,2017
1385,"Reliable transmission and high data rate over underwater acoustic channels are considerably challenging. In this paper, we propose Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) scheme using a Hyperbolic Frequency Modulation (HFM) waveform. Our proposed system combines the advantages of both systems-special multiplexing of MIMO and immunity against Doppler shift of HFM. To increase the spectral efficiency, we employ M-ray HFM and overlapped sub-channels by leveraging the high temporal resolution characteristic. To verify effectiveness of our system, we have designed a theoretically enhanced acoustic simulator, which especially focuses on the reflection phenomenon by utilizing approved reflection loss models. Based on our acoustic simulator, we could verify that our system is robust against for multipath fading and Doppler shifting while keeping the multiplexing benefit of MIMO, while maintaining a very low complexity and system overhead. In addition, the results provide a useful insight for physical layer design in acoustic communication systems.","['Sungryul Kim', 'Younghwan Yoo']",f1bacaf8-f96e-4ab7-a287-8b3851bf0b4c,0,"['1b9324de-d990-48f4-8f38-ed415602dc08', '432c982a-629f-444b-9ee4-32772c93a106', '4abfa6c9-5807-412a-944c-301e99f26306', '5de5ac35-ba0c-4428-b464-66417e92f653', '81769330-a04e-4275-bd79-664f021bd8ea', 'a9715a71-d905-4b35-8cd4-d6dfe9a88d67', 'b3d38c4e-534f-48e1-a66d-1c1d9bbc4432']",MIMO-HFM: A MIMO System with Hyperbolic Frequency Modulation for Underwater Acoustic Communication,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
1386,"In this paper, we study linear encoding for a pair of correlated Gaussian sources transmitted over a two-user Gaussian broadcast channel in the presence of unit-delay noiseless feedback, abbreviated as the GBCF. Each pair of source samples is transmitted using a linear transmission scheme in a  finite  number of channel uses. We investigate three linear transmission schemes: A scheme based on the Ozarow–Leung (OL) code, a scheme based on the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) code of Ardestanizadeh et al., and a novel scheme derived in this paper using a dynamic programming (DP) approach. For the OL and LQG schemes we present lower and upper bounds on the minimal number of channel uses needed to achieve a target mean-square error (MSE) pair. For the LQG scheme in the symmetric setting, we identify the optimal scaling of the sources, which results in a significant improvement of its finite horizon performance, and, in addition, characterize the (exact) minimal number of channel uses required to achieve a target MSE. Finally, for the symmetric setting, we show that for any fixed and finite number of channel uses, the DP scheme achieves an MSE lower than the MSE achieved by either the LQG or the OL schemes.","['Yonathan Murin', 'Yonatan Kaspi', 'Ron Dabora', 'Deniz Gunduz']",41d9e225-639f-4867-8797-e487d7e52343,50,"['05876a63-d373-406e-a32b-c0a2a97aefc3', '121c2094-6f63-4cc3-8b80-9dc55889507d', '1714e2dc-5ec2-40c3-85fd-d09261d471ec', '21dd6e3a-d316-41ad-afbe-7786a551059d', '2431ca8e-d592-4dc5-9d37-c9cd604a3be4', '28427cd6-afdd-491f-844b-c44a9961ee34', '3c7fd039-ee30-4cfc-b49b-f29483056a4c', '3ede6c3f-e8c0-46d4-9f5c-d4d274b8c406', '4a8dea56-ed71-48e9-9852-8dc1f269eec4', '512f2d64-96cf-4d0e-83b7-0115e4840ab1', '53b632f3-fca0-431b-94e4-1b88a56d0c6f', '58748f8b-73b7-4319-bf34-79357ce5bb48', '58c8fd74-cd1b-4a05-b3c5-ab5bd08c0aed', '5dd89e18-aba8-44de-bdf3-364b240afdbf', '5e9782c0-314a-4123-87e1-c65cc2ed816e', '5f96bf6c-299f-4080-afe4-8c996ee42a04', '7a773b88-5e7d-481e-852a-2dd0e8997284', '853f1b8e-6c1a-4ecd-a0db-359a0960a81f', '8e6765ba-6c42-4230-b406-441d3094425c', '95f28466-123c-4d17-acb0-9b5fe38066bf', 'aa19e062-8014-488b-bdd6-f4be1a15df8a', 'ccd743f1-bf55-4744-863c-1febce0dfa9a', 'cfdb3e0a-f7a0-4d4f-b5a7-b6b39a260e40', 'd2e96ed9-78d2-4874-8859-3892988220ba', 'e6929043-e58a-441d-8937-92db518e6dc6', 'f8d98b7b-da52-42d5-b529-af466c795c2d', 'ff06b6b1-6408-438b-a879-3ff2d59452c0', 'ffa8e71d-343e-447f-ab9e-f5f5483f9bdd']",Finite-Length Linear Schemes for Joint Source-Channel Coding Over Gaussian Broadcast Channels With Feedback,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,2017
1387,"We investigate the statistical efficiency of maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) with nonlinear observation models and additive Gaussian noises. Although we and many others have found empirically that in many cases the sample variances of the parameter estimates via Monte Carlo runs match statistically their corresponding Cramer–Rao lower bounds, there has been, up to now, no formal proof to support this. In this letter, we show that the MLE obtained using the iterated least squares method is unbiased and satisfies the  generalized collinearity condition  between the estimation error and the gradient of the log-likelihood function w.r.t. the parameter vector that is sufficient for the MLE to be efficient. In other words, the MLE is an efficient estimator regardless of the sample size, although, admittedly, this may not be observed for very ill-conditioned problems. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the statistical efficiency for such problems.","['Qin Lu', 'Yaakov Bar-Shalom', 'Peter Willett', 'Shengli Zhou']",8748a570-3996-4cb1-bf2b-c7c04e9e9983,0,"['429ebb3a-0d3e-496c-a971-1f3334eabeb5', '7a0292c4-9f5a-47c0-b6a4-aea6805e8ccc', 'dab45495-d8b0-4a00-9ff5-83fa7a7dd643']",All Nonlinear Observation Models With Additive Gaussian Noises Enjoy Efficient MLEs,IEEE Signal Processing Letters,2017

The novelty of this paper comes from the consideration of a new summation inequality which is less conservative than the usual Jensen inequality, the Abel-Lemma based inequality and the Seuret inequality. Based on the inequality, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the systems to be admissible. Moreover, the corresponding conditions for the existence of desired static output feedback controller gains are derived to guarantee that the closed-loop system is admissible. The conditions can be solved by a modified cone complementarity linearization (CCL) algorithm.

1390,"Skilled human full-body movements are often planned in a highly predictive manner. For example, during walking while reaching towards a goal object results in steps and body postures are adapted to the goal position already multiple steps before the goal contact. The realization of such highly predictive behaviors for humanoid robots is a challenge because standard approaches, such as optimal control, result in computation times that are prohibitive for the predictive control of complex coordinated full-body movements over multiple steps. We devised a new architecture that combines the online-planning of complex coordinated full-body movements, based on the flexible combination of learned dynamic movement primitives, with a Walking Pattern Generator (WPG), based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which generates dynamically feasible locomotion of the humanoid robot HRP-2. A dynamic filter corrects the Zero Moment Point (ZMP) trajectories in order to guarantee the dynamic feasibility of the executed behavior taking into account the upper-body movements, at the same time ensuring an accurate approximation of the planned motion trajectories. We demonstrate the high flexibility of the chosen movement planning approach, and the accuracy and feasibility of the generated motion. In addition, we show that a na¨ivena¨ive approach, which generates adaptive motion by using machine learning methods by the interpolation between feasible training motion examples fails to guarantee the stability and dynamic feasibility of the generated behaviors.","['Albert Mukovskiy', 'Christian Vassallo', 'Maximilien Naveau', 'Olivier Stasse', 'Philippe Souères', 'Martin A.

1391,"It is well known that the ratio between received crosstalk and received signal in telephony cabling increases with the frequency until both levels become about equal. Transmission systems like VDSL and G.fast are designed to cope with that. But the awareness that the increase of EL-FEXT (equal level – far end cross talk) becomes much stronger above a certain frequency (increases with 40 dB instead of 20 dB per decade) was raised only recently in ITU and BBF standardization bodies for G.fast. This second order effect became known under the name “dual slope” effect, was initially not well understood, and resulted in a number of conjectured explanations. This paper demonstrates that this second order effect in far end crosstalk between opposite wire pairs in the same quad is deterministic in nature. It is caused by the interaction of the twist in a quad and its metallic surroundings (e.g., shield). The twist of these quads reduces this second order crosstalk effect significantly, but what remains causes a slope of 40 dB/decade. This paper shows via a model that this second order effect scales linearly with the cable length and twist length, and validates that via measurements. It quantifies how sensitive this effect is to cable design parameters like twist length and capacitance to shield. In addition, an extension is proposed to a commonly used simplified system model for describing the far end cross talk as a function of the frequency and cable length.",['Rob van den Brink'],419a5182-2560-4380-9f84-f25201c395fe,0,"['20dfb30c-dd4d-4bac-98c9-2000513a423e', '3dd4baca-6609-4bef-9a2f-592ba0eb1cb4']",Modeling the Dual-Slope Behavior of in-Quad EL-FEXT in Twisted Pair Quad Cables,IEEE Transactions on Communications,2017
1392,"In this paper, we propose a modified carry select adder (CSLA) structure which is more power/energy and area-efficient compared to the existing CSLAs. The higher efficiency is achieved by modifying the logic formulations of the carry generation and selection (CGS) scheme and merging all of its redundant logic operations in the carry generation (CG) and carry selection (CS) units of the CGS-based CSLA (CGS-CSLA) structure. This leads to a simplified structure. Next, the proposed CSLA structure is employed to design efficient square-root CSLA (SQRT-CSLA) structure. The efficiency of the proposed SQRT-CSLA is investigated by comparing its speed, power, energy, and area parameters with those of some other SQRT-CSLA structures, including conventional SQRT-CSLA, binary to excess-1 converter, common Boolean logic, and the CGS-based SQRT-CSLA structures. The investigation, which is performed using HSPICE simulations based on a 45 nm bulk CMOS technology, includes 8, 16, 32, and 64-bit adder structures. The impact of voltage scaling on the efficiency of the proposed structure is also studied by changing the supply voltage levels from the near-threshold voltage to the nominal supply voltage.

1394,"NGS technology represents a powerful alternative to the standard Sanger sequencing in the context of clinical setting. The proprietary software that are generally used for variant calling often depend on preset parameters that may not fit in a satisfactory manner for different genes. GATK, which is widely used in the academic world, is rich in parameters for variant calling. However the self-adjusting parameter calibration of GATK requires data from a large number of exomes. When these are not available, which is the standard condition of a diagnostic laboratory, the parameters must be set by the operator (hard filtering). The aim of the present paper was to set up a procedure to assess the best parameters to be used in the hard filtering of GATK. This was pursued by using classification trees on true and false variants from simulated sequences of a real dataset data. We simulated two datasets, with different coverages, including all the sequence alterations identified in a real dataset according to their observed frequencies. Simulated sequences were aligned with standard protocols and then regression trees were built up to identify the most reliable parameters and cutoff values to discriminate true and false variant calls. Moreover, we analyzed flanking sequences of region presenting a high rate of false positive calls observing that such sequences present a low complexity make up. Our results showed that GATK hard filtering parameter values can be tailored through a simulation study based-on the DNA region of interest to ameliorate the accuracy of the variant calling.","['Simona De Summa', 'Giovanni Malerba', 'Rosamaria Pinto', 'Antonio Mori', 'Vladan Mijatovic', 'Stefania Tommasi']",5f420114-34db-4a1b-a19c-7952929ac8f4,50,"['1a353dac-b799-47eb-9c47-da43de7c6f07', '9d4bdbfc-8962-4935-9255-38ae1f261942', 'c2479968-5e66-44a6-a292-8f49cb0e4de6', 'cebcea9a-f696-405e-a5a3-a9f9095385e2', 'ef5e8281-7497-47a6-aa71-667d1fb05536']",GATK hard filtering: tunable parameters to improve variant calling for next generation sequencing targeted gene panel data,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
1395,"During the last decade, several scientometrics as well as bibliometrics indices were proposed to quantify the scientific impact of individual. The h-index gives a breakthrough in scientific evaluation, but this index suffers with big hit problem, i.e., once a paper is selected in h-core publication, further citation of h-core articles is not considered in scientific evaluation. To overcome this limitation of h-index, the e-index was proposed, but it does not consider the core citation count. It considers only the excess citation count. To overcome this limitation, the EM-index is proposed in this article. The EM-index is the extension of h-index and e-index, which uses the concept of multidimensional h-index. The EM-index uses all citation counts of h-core articles at multi-level to quantify the scientific impact of the individual. But this index does not consider all publication citations. To overcome this limitation of EM-index a multidimensional extension of the EM-index is also proposed called EM′-index. To validate the proposed indicators, an experimental analysis has been done on 82 scientist’s publication citation count, who are working in scientiometrics field. In such a way, we found a more balanced and fine-grained approach to evaluate the scientific impact of individual as well as to compare the scientific impact of two different researchers/scientists.","['Anand Bihari', 'Sudhakar Tripathi']",4b13bf3c-1339-463e-bc9c-4b130b2026fd,0,"['052333f7-d99d-4771-b885-b40fce617275', '097d5c59-d0de-4584-b1b2-3f2953bd81e1', '0c62f13a-48d2-4864-9d14-385fc68f80c6', '2cdb1d6d-8a4d-415d-bb9c-ef0631de2d31', '336f412e-caef-4160-bdb4-13daad807f5e', '456e4fc9-ee53-4de9-a98c-5d63f1854e8d', '484967b2-02d3-4733-b8ff-f4f82c68395a', '51d125e8-3d8c-4ea1-8fc7-e05897ab7a44', '60945334-c276-426e-b4f3-ad0a8366f1ba', '7bdb17f1-a013-435e-80b5-f05ec5c3f1ad', '8e8b3e55-0a63-4d6d-a8a2-786151acf3da', '95109fed-53fb-4a12-b3a6-f656f970b46d', 'b2cd500d-c1d0-41ab-aa36-0ab3a24fc7f2', 'e0595daa-fb3d-40c0-9e7d-be9931be2b3b', 'e59cc81c-a6ed-4675-a403-ad4d812ecfa7', 'f546e0ee-21e9-47c8-bd18-f2982b7afea2', 'fb35ccff-d0b2-470d-b6ee-3cd4cd64a0b3']",EM-index: a new measure to evaluate the scientific impact of scientists,Scientometrics,2017
1396,"Abstract  This work aims to estimate the degree of adverse drug reactions (ADR) for psychiatric medications from social media, including Twitter, Reddit, and LiveJournal. Advances in lightning-fast cluster computing was employed to process large scale data, consisting of 6.4 terabytes of data containing 3.8 billion records from all the media. Rates of ADR were quantified using the SIDER database of drugs and side-effects, and an estimated ADR rate was based on the prevalence of discussion in the social media corpora. Agreement between these measures for a sample of ten popular psychiatric drugs was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient,  r , with values between 0.08 and 0.50. Word2vec, a novel neural learning framework, was utilized to improve the coverage of variants of ADR terms in the unstructured text by identifying syntactically or semantically similar terms. Improved correlation coefficients, between 0.29 and 0.59, demonstrates the capability of advanced techniques in machine learning to aid in the discovery of meaningful patterns from medical data, and social media data, at scale.","['Thin Nguyen', 'Mark E.

The morphological characteristics analysed are the thickness and the length of an object.#R##N#Results#R##N#The segmentation method was evaluated using an image database of vein sections stained with Weigert's resorcin–fuchsin. The performance results are based on a ground truth generated manually resulting in values of sensitivity greater than 80% with the exception in two samples, and specificity values above 90% for all samples. Medical specialists carried out a visual evaluation where the observations indicate a general agreement on the segmentation results’ visual quality, and the consistency between the methodology proposed and the subjective observation of the doctors for the evaluation of pathological changes in vessel wall.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#The proposed methodology provides more objective measurements than the qualitative methods traditionally used in the histological analysis, with a significant potential for this method to be used as a diagnostic aid for many other vascular pathological conditions and in similar tissues such as skin and mucous membranes.","['Pablo Hernández-Morera', 'Carlos M.

Finally, a diversity-based selection strategy is designed by assembling greedy selection strategy and defining a new weighted fitness value based on the fitness values and positions of target and trial individuals.

1401,"Due to the lack of label information and the intrinsic complexity of hyperspectral images (HSIs), unsupervised band selection is always one of the most challenging tasks in HSI processing. Fuzzy clustering is a promising technique for unsupervised band selection, which can partition unlabeled data into groups effectively. However, due to the limits of its optimization process, standard fuzzy clustering is sensitive to initialization and easy to be trapped in a local optimum. To address the limits, a novel unsupervised band selection method is proposed, combining fuzzy clustering with particle swarm optimization (PSO). A newly designed PSO algorithm is introduced to improve the performance of fuzzy clustering band selection. Moreover, a new strategy is designed to select representative cluster centers according to the characteristics of HSIs. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has the ability to select high-quality band subsets with good and robust performance on HSI classification.","['Mingyang Zhang', 'Jingjing Ma', 'Maoguo Gong']",1c453bdb-dbcd-40f8-8544-78e1eca1131c,0,"['07b5d057-8baf-4579-9215-c055fe845369', '287f89a5-60b2-4b5d-9aa1-d6e8a15cd73e', '2be1b7d2-98ea-46cf-a426-1098a0763cf9', '32ca1d60-40dc-4b7b-a3d3-428b668c6896', '73a4218d-fe69-4da3-81d7-df139bc505c7', '860cbf17-283d-4940-a0e6-e35654eca4d9', '91922780-9dc2-47fc-86fe-322ca78f3f5a', '9bedf306-b0f3-4ed0-b89c-c2a410881354', 'b77a6dcc-68e5-4c7d-bee0-84a041542f84', 'b8e46308-51d9-4fff-b3bb-8224c380b394', 'baeb77d6-06d3-4691-906a-00aba558fdd0', 'd0b7a733-22fa-41b6-89fa-c6f02fc99369', 'dede1667-4a7c-44ea-b522-be6fbd442c05', 'f4a64e6f-abe7-4cba-a840-87e0e514d947', 'fdef03d6-4121-4c79-a342-8bc29116e585', 'fe44c5ca-2ada-4708-b3f2-d33cf7e74e45']",Unsupervised Hyperspectral Band Selection by Fuzzy Clustering With Particle Swarm Optimization,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
1402,"Assessing the performance of each of the team members in any project is a difficult task since in most cases the outcomes mask the individual contributions. In this paper a two-step approach is proposed to estimate the relative performance of the members of the organization who have participated in the different projects carried out. Firstly, a DEA model evaluates the efficiency of the projects, whose results are used later on in a regression model to assess the performance of each individual. The proposed approach is validated using 480 instances identifying the factors that may affect the accuracy of the results. The application to a case study involving a real-world dataset of 46 software development projects carried out by a ten-member team is also presented. The results show that the proposed approach estimates, on average, the unknown true efficiency of the individuals rather well and is robust against data noise.","['Belarmino Adenso-Díaz', 'Sebastián Lozano', 'Ester Gutiérrez', 'Lourdes M.

1403,"This study examines how managerial incentives may drive firms to adopt a proactive strategic posture to implement more information technology (IT) than competitors. We consider both performance incentives that motivate managers to enhance firm returns and risk incentives that motivate managers to take risks. Our empirical analysis shows that while the proactiveness in IT strategic posture leads to both firm returns and firm risk, risk incentives rather than performance incentives essentially drive the proactiveness in IT strategic posture. These findings highlight the issue of managerial risk aversion and the important role of risk incentives in strategic IT decisions. Our study also shows that in diversified firms, risk incentives have a stronger marginal impact on the proactiveness in IT strategic posture in secondary business areas than in primary business areas. Performance incentives, however, may even generate a negative marginal impact on the proactiveness in IT strategic posture in secondary busin...","['Ling Xue', 'Gautam Ray', 'Xia Zhao']",4e2b15ad-a695-4a60-9c6c-07522b3208cd,0,"['0d6c5366-aad8-4b06-9b5c-e8f71624f9b3', '1413142e-0d12-499c-adcb-3b5af910937a', '2227e9b9-6314-4da4-bb43-34fe1f9df681', '226de99d-c94c-4dcc-8397-8c03a5aa2e78', '2a055398-fad4-4160-95ba-434e468653fd', '33a355b2-0bfd-4ad2-ad35-fdad404320b6', '38c530dd-7bab-4388-971c-64fbc3b80949', '5c9460a0-cdd6-4c8d-8c27-29292be0c373', '5d7c0a32-c6b4-4838-bddf-f3914b310a9e', '79956991-4188-4f32-8887-2d7fa9cb1b96', '7e3052dc-7397-4ca6-9034-8f34eb002818', '8e60aa53-1d5a-4f6c-9f47-586d7d015939', '9d784779-1987-4a5a-8ede-cdaf40cd6b5c', 'a26176f8-ba96-4046-88d5-ef3596d89f33', 'af6db407-f9cf-4fdd-bb61-5927a5a836d8', 'c248cdb8-905d-4da8-86ce-a9a6e0b59723', 'd3793a30-8c57-4e76-bb41-0d93114e3b2a', 'e89c70fa-aefc-4695-87ab-ba980b467a94']",Managerial Incentives and IT Strategic Posture,Information Systems Research,2017

New important players are emerging, and the scope of the mobile ecosystem is expanding and encroaching on the technological boundaries of other IT ecosystems. However, our understanding of the mobile ecosystem has been limited given the few existing studies. Therefore, in this paper, we empirically examine the network structure of a mobile ecosystem by measuring the technology knowledge flows between firms based on a patent citation analysis of the mobile industry. We found that platform providers are emerging as the center of the knowledge flow activity in the ecosystem. By introducing a new network index, the Network Concentration Index, which measures a firm’s knowledge concentration ratio toward subsectors, we also found that each platform provider shows distinctive changing patterns in their technology knowledge network and that each is forming its own sub-network with increased influence on affiliated firms.","['Sang-Hoon Lee', 'Wonjoon Kim']",152acbfc-d731-49c2-8fb8-2c22e0b6648a,0,"['0627ea3f-c2a9-410e-8e67-ad5f08e1326d', '1661aa83-dc52-4c25-9e6e-9c22ffeefa3a', '193440da-a81c-441d-8b35-6605fc9cb056', '2ade7dc6-10ed-4938-b94f-3dacd3be5add', '2b41466c-20bb-4a69-9bf0-93899d45915d', '4367bcb2-b480-452e-92aa-9cc697639638', '6d2c77ef-637c-48ad-b3ed-98829420d751', '77f9adec-3f94-464b-8e57-9470a29386b3', '795aadf7-de00-4f50-b200-47a66705c379', '817cfec1-035a-40fd-8acd-fb494080c2b1', '869df78a-235f-4a41-bdf4-f5f3b9f81def', 'a86ce04a-282a-4a54-bc96-b488d79bd1d0', 'c4c29c66-8814-4166-947e-088b7b0e6dae', 'd3cd919a-b1cb-4c3c-9594-a823d01fafc9', 'e571ddaf-49d9-41cd-81f7-79ce35d76572']",The knowledge network dynamics in a mobile ecosystem: a patent citation analysis,Scientometrics,2017

1406,"The stochastic multimodal problem commonly arises in the search for efficiency and solution quality in practice. In this study, a hybrid approach is developed for the stochastic multimodal problem. The proposed approach comprises particle swarm optimization (PSO), constriction factor PSO (CPSO), and elite group optimal computing budget allocation (EGOCBA). CPSO or PSO is applied to determine the correct direction in the design space, and EGOCBA is adopted to allocate the appropriate number of samples to each alternative and provide reliable evaluations and identifications to rank particles in the CPSO or PSO procedure. This work improves the searching efficiency of optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) in the stochastic multimodal problem. Several alternatives referred to as the “elite group,” the performance of which is close to that of the current best solution in each swarm, absorb most of the computing budget of OCBA. However, distinguishing the best solution from the elite group is time consuming because of the various local and global optima in the stochastic multimodal problem. Therefore, this study proposes EGOCBA that avoids extra computing costs for the elite group by implementing a new selection procedure. This EGOCBA reserves all the solutions of the elite group and filters them to form an optimal set that contains all the best solutions having an equal mean performance without a significant difference. These tasks are achieved through a confidence interval test in the end of the algorithm. The optimal set can provide more than one best solution to support multiple decisions depending on different decision variables. Two experiments are conducted on stochastic multimodal optimization problem and stochastic resource allocation problem. Experimental results reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach in deriving multiple optimal solutions in a multimodal class and stochastic environment.","['Chun-Chih Chiu', 'James T.

1407,"With the increasing number of bug reports coming into the open bug repository, it is impossible to triage bug reports manually by software managers. This paper proposes a novel approach called En-LDA (Entropy optimized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)) for automatic bug report assignment. Specifically, we propose entropy to optimize the number of topics of the LDA model and further use the entropy optimized LDA to capture the expertise and interest of developers in bug resolution. A developer’s interest in a topic is modeled by the number of the developer’s comments on bug reports of the topic divided by the number of all the developer’s comments. A developer’s expertise in a topic is modeled by the number of the developer’s comments on bug reports of the topic divided by the number of all developers’ comments on the topic. Given a new bug report, En-LDA recommends a ranked list of developers who are potentially adequate to resolve the new bug. Experiments on Eclipse JDT and Mozilla Firefox projects show that En-LDA can achieve high recall up to 84% and 58%, and precision up to 28% and 41%, respectively, which indicates promising aspects of the proposed approach.","['Wen Zhang', 'Yangbo Cui', 'Taketoshi Yoshida']",05af0f02-9c79-4644-8a42-eea3525ace4e,0,"['3b458352-0abd-48b6-b7d1-7f892141f1dc', '6aec772b-ed45-4adc-b53f-c3dba2be760e', '8bc5f80f-af26-47b4-aa0a-aab3a2e6c503', 'b3a7fd67-48f7-4d96-8c4f-3acca33f9a55', 'cf6c7df7-d161-49b5-97b3-346b391c0422']",En-LDA: An Novel Approach to Automatic Bug Report Assignment with Entropy Optimized Latent Dirichlet Allocation,Entropy,2017

The matrices based on fractional lower order moments for the extended sensor array outputs, which have been shown to have similar forms to the covariance matrix for the Gaussian distributed signals and noise, are formulated for the case of complex \( S\alpha S \) signals and noise. Therefore, the similarity transformation based estimating signal parameter via rotational invariance techniques can be applied to these matrices resulting to the improved direction of arrival estimates for noncircular signals in the presence of impulsive noise environments. The robustness of our proposed algorithm, especially for low generalized signal to noise ratio situations, and for quite highly impulsive noise environments is demonstrated by Monte-Carlo simulations.","['Jinfeng Zhang', 'Tianshuang Qiu']",09ab0f27-d494-477d-ba5c-8b1c567b8397,0,"['07e22da4-3487-4471-9a3b-7861a3974903', '1cc804b7-0d5b-4633-af25-4ed89788d67b', '3baebcd1-6a81-4c64-8c21-4641208e78e6', '48dd5180-86fe-46eb-9866-b0e8ff777f87', '5315f197-f194-45ec-a0fd-539732184700', '5535b036-5196-4aff-b4bd-a63d6c215df4', '74b35e39-b802-4f37-bac8-418abf324aae', '81566d1e-d387-4fdf-9f18-19d1384ff9c1', '9d10b285-6f27-407e-a670-8f830c17f062', 'b5d22191-9947-4190-bc8c-e05ae5ab5e95', 'c19d054b-1b3d-499f-a2c7-3292331b1af0', 'd0575969-68ba-4a58-b5e1-3e51f44dd2ad', 'e79e04a1-5cce-4ece-97f2-cbeacaf78c21', 'e825d656-98d2-458e-ac4e-1a3ab4119d60', 'e9adc572-d87e-4fc1-93f7-af18d0d8f336']",The Fractional Lower Order Moments Based ESPRIT Algorithm for Noncircular Signals in Impulsive Noise Environments,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

Results  There were more negative tweets about the school meals policy than positive ones (16.8% vs. 12.9%), in addition to neutral tweets (70.3%). The main targets for negative opinions were campaign and food, and those for positive opinions were policy and health benefits. The opinion holders represent a wide range of policy stakeholders. The first-hand source dominated the opinions. Statement accounted for the function of most opinions. Females (62.5%) were more involved than males (37.5%), and people in the South and the West regions (64.2%) engaged themselves more than people in the Northeast and the Midwest (35.8%) of the U.S.  Conclusions  Negative opinions about the school meals policy consistently outnumbered positive ones. The findings discovered the public's opinions for policy improvement, contributed to the evidence base of health benefits for policy promotion and community collaboration, and revealed interesting gender and regional differences in the opinions. The social media analytics offers significant methodological implications for discovering the public opinions on food policies.","['Yin Kang', 'Youfa Wang', 'Dongsong Zhang', 'Lina Zhou']",220b356a-c13f-4f23-b00d-b909047ac07f,0,"['4a30a1ae-7069-4e06-8a44-db386b26b78c', '9e4859ce-16a8-4d7f-ba0d-21fe49950105', 'b2c41254-ff64-4b22-954d-b25169ab8861']",The public’s opinions on a new school meals policy for childhood obesity prevention in the U.S.: A social media analytics approach,International Journal of Medical Informatics,2017
1412,"A polar coordinate system introduces a singularity at the pole,   r=0     r  =  0       , where terms with a factor   1/r     1  /  r        can be ill-defined. While there are several approaches to eliminate this pole singularity in finite difference methods, finite volume methods largely bypass this issue by not storing or computing data at the pole. However, all methods face a very restrictive time step when using an explicit time advancement scheme in the azimuthal direction, where cell sizes are of the order   O(Δr(rΔθ))     O  (  Δ  r  (  r  Δ  θ  )  )       . We use a conservative finite volume approach of merging cells on a structured O-mesh to remove this time step limit imposed by the CFL condition. The cell-merging procedure is implemented as a corrector step and incurs no changes to the underlying data structure for a structured grid. This short note describes the procedure and presents the validation and application of the algorithm to various problems. The algorithm is shown to be inexpensive and scalable. In addition, the cell-merging procedure is easily coupled with a line implicit scheme in the radial direction.","['Rajapandiyan Asaithambi', 'Krishnan Mahesh']",673c50b0-cf0d-4a95-b8d4-b483c54a2d96,0,['7cd678ba-de8e-497b-96f1-bf5536b12105'],A note on a conservative finite volume approach to address numerical stiffness in polar meshes,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
1413,"There are many data pre-processing techniques that aim at enhancing the quality of classifiers induced by machine learning algorithms. Functional expansions (FE) are one of such techniques, which has been originally proposed to aid neural network based classification. Despite of being successfully employed, works reported in the literature use the same functional expansion, with the same expansion size (ES), applied to each attribute that describes the training data. In this paper it is argued that FE and ES can be attribute-oriented and, by choosing the most suitable FE–SE pair for each attribute, the input data representation improves and, as a consequence, learning algorithms can induce better classifiers. This paper proposes, as a pre-processing step to learning algorithms, a method that uses a genetic algorithm for searching for a suitable FE–SE pair for each data attribute, aiming at producing functionally extended training data. Experimental results using functionally expanded training sets, considering four classification algorithms, KNN, CART, SVM and RBNN, have confirmed the hypothesis; the proposed method for searching for FE–SE pairs through an attribute-oriented fashion has yielded statistically significant better results than learning from the original data or by considering the result from the best FE–SE pair for all attributes.","['João Roberto Bertini Junior', 'Maria do Carmo Nicoletti']",84f112c2-e26f-48f0-ab34-bf7eba96696c,0,"['1f888552-7aec-43bc-80c7-60a791479e8a', '4fae825a-b9de-4400-a124-1dc58629dac0', '5f3fc872-c39e-429a-abad-e47a85218226', '730c0547-e9aa-4f13-9c3d-ddf88d6a211c', '79fd8d7a-d3c0-4ebf-b775-70432690a66d', '80bde34b-fcc5-4c17-bc3e-d608ca37148c', '87e47740-d01f-4d30-bf32-db6cd435829a', '8f15577f-aaa6-4a35-afa6-db7e318466e7', '95903ebb-fd48-4bb6-b540-2f430c7b559c', 'aa767a83-de19-4421-bfb4-f63808992758', 'b3a9c566-a8f7-405b-9cbf-095fa4377942', 'c2a6a06e-69dd-4bfd-a30b-7619fed665e9', 'c68e7934-e3db-40eb-869c-317b59b51e9a', 'dad6406f-ca2f-4932-b0b7-d49f96953afc', 'f25b8c39-386f-44cf-a967-f717d058812c']",Enhancing classification performance using attribute-oriented functionally expanded data,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017
1414,"Being able to automatically predict digital picture quality, as perceived by human observers, has become important in many applications where humans are the ultimate consumers of displayed visual information. Standard dynamic range (SDR) images provide 8 b/color/pixel. High dynamic range (HDR) images, which are usually created from multiple exposures of the same scene, can provide 16 or 32 b/color/pixel, but must be tonemapped to SDR for display on standard monitors. Multi-exposure fusion techniques bypass HDR creation, by fusing the exposure stack directly to SDR format while aiming for aesthetically pleasing luminance and color distributions. Here, we describe a new no-reference image quality assessment (NR IQA) model for HDR pictures that is based on standard measurements of the bandpass and on newly conceived differential natural scene statistics (NSS) of HDR pictures. We derive an algorithm from the model which we call the HDR IMAGE GRADient-based Evaluator. NSS models have previously been used to devise NR IQA models that effectively predict the subjective quality of SDR images, but they perform significantly worse on tonemapped HDR content. Toward ameliorating this we make here the following contributions: 1) we design HDR picture NR IQA models and algorithms using both standard space-domain NSS features as well as novel HDR-specific gradient-based features that significantly elevate prediction performance; 2) we validate the proposed models on a large-scale crowdsourced HDR image database; and 3) we demonstrate that the proposed models also perform well on legacy natural SDR images.

1415,"Molecular fingerprints are widely used in several areas of chemoinformatics including diversity analysis and similarity searching. The fingerprint-based analysis of chemical libraries, in particular of large collections, usually requires the molecular representation of each compound in the library that may lead to issues of storage space and redundant calculations. In fact, information redundancy is inherent to the data, resulting on binary digit positions in the fingerprint without significant information. Herein is proposed a general approach to represent an entire compound library with a single binary fingerprint. The development of the database fingerprint (DFP) is illustrated first using a short fingerprint (MACCS keys) for 10 data sets of general interest in chemistry. The application of the DFP is further shown with PubChem fingerprints for the data sets used in the primary example but with a larger number of compounds, up to 25,000 molecules. The performance of DFP were studied through differential Shannon entropy, k-mean clustering, and DFP/Tanimoto similarity. The DFP is designed to capture key information of the compound collection and can be used to compare and assess the diversity of molecular libraries. This Preliminary Communication shows the potential of the novel fingerprint to conduct inter-library relationships. A major future goal is to apply the DFP for virtual screening and developing DFP for other data sets based on several different type of fingerprints.#N#                    #N#                      Graphical Abstract#N#                      #N#                        Database fingerprint captures the key information of molecular databases to perform chemical space characterization and virtual screening","['Eli Fernández-de Gortari', 'César R.

1416,"Time-varying mixture models are useful for representing complex, dynamic distributions. Components in the mixture model can appear and disappear, and persisting components can evolve. This allows great flexibility in streaming data applications where the model can be adjusted as new data arrives. Fitting a mixture model with computational guarantees which can meet real-time requirements is challenging with existing algorithms, especially when the model order can vary with time. Existing approximate inference methods may require multiple restarts to search for a good local solution. Monte-Carlo methods can be used to jointly estimate the model order and model parameters, but when the distribution of each mixand has a high-dimensional parameter space, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and and from slow convergence. This paper proposes a generative model for time-varying mixture models, tailored for mixtures of discrete-time Markov chains. A novel, deterministic inference procedure is introduced and is shown to be suitable for applications requiring real-time estimation, and the method is guaranteed to converge at each time step. As a motivating application, we model and predict traffic patterns in a transportation network. Experiments illustrate the performance of the scheme and offer insights regarding tuning of the algorithm parameters. The experiments also investigate the predictive power of the proposed model compared to less complex models and demonstrate the superiority of the mixture model approach for prediction of traffic routes in real data.","['Sean F.

1417,"Community question answering (cQA) has become an important issue due to the popularity of cQA archives on the Web. This paper focuses on addressing the lexical gap problem in question retrieval. Question retrieval in cQA archives aims to find the existing questions that are semantically equivalent or relevant to the queried questions. However, the lexical gap problem brings a new challenge for question retrieval in cQA. In this paper, we propose to model and learn distributed word representations with metadata of category information within cQA pages for question retrieval using two novel category powered models. One is a basic category powered model called MB-NET and the other one is an enhanced category powered model called ME-NET which can better learn the distributed word representations and alleviate the lexical gap problem. To deal with the variable size of word representation vectors, we employ the framework of fisher kernel to transform them into the fixed-length vectors. Experimental results on large-scale English and Chinese cQA data sets show that our proposed approaches can significantly outperform state-of-the-art retrieval models for question retrieval in cQA. Moreover, we further conduct our approaches on large-scale automatic evaluation experiments. The evaluation results show that promising and significant performance improvements can be achieved.","['Guangyou Zhou', 'Jimmy Xiangji Huang']",ddf911d1-be50-4533-8f81-24caf49330d9,0,"['050f3d56-45c0-4c32-86fb-db2fe9b5fb88', '05a26679-accd-40b0-bef4-b91fc84a0ffc', '0e5598c8-cc5c-48af-b91d-63305bd6ab91', '13f46321-bb99-4414-98eb-ba688e570032', '16b6ba5b-e6c8-407d-92f9-c7b599bc8e93', '17e5b26e-0837-4312-8c2c-681348c936e5', '1a585aaf-65e5-4a64-b9c5-8c58b2e2877c', '1c55af7b-242e-42ec-8f87-13b04754ea7b', '1dd1f008-045d-4ed6-bc32-57b92860a647', '1f93cfa0-d51d-4924-a297-735b25b6e7e0', '2a4c74f6-7356-4e2b-b033-bd1aed30d669', '2bba6d5a-2734-4636-8138-4c056fd65b57', '2c55cca4-5f59-44a7-951c-6c8888767ccc', '3ba1f3f1-7616-46bf-8857-1f5dbafd45d5', '3cc33516-3ae7-494e-966c-0f845c044474', '492f4525-17a3-43b4-88cc-2cb691dad52b', '4cce1733-8ecc-4878-9803-d74ddedccb08', '518aae9f-958e-48a5-8a38-9387ee8e96fd', '5268e27a-b454-46f8-90fd-e4710ea5a4da', '55e74947-c286-4f76-995d-8747e8b11a42', '5c1dccc5-f4c4-4ae4-9341-21a956cce441', '62668f3d-845a-4f8a-bd2d-8fe19fb70e9f', '637aa8f1-85aa-4566-8c5a-30c83027d780', '67aa8beb-4902-4dcd-ba39-13058c2ba3c9', '6f2319fe-dad0-4d89-8165-7340e16f1931', '70564c6a-6553-4c67-978e-cc0cde42b16e', '708fe091-ce2d-462c-a36b-299dc63dbe0c', '72452f5e-c1e1-4675-8fd8-25b70690e1f0', '73a18bb7-5d0a-40ab-8796-32722d5ff563', '78a84e09-8696-4f12-bfc3-f1d79392bcae', '7aa454b2-47c6-4117-b823-1df65289e8e7', '88aac5cb-119b-4c92-8271-d94d51e18b90', '8b49daa4-cbb3-4842-8ee4-3c2280a6177e', '8cb1c719-99b5-4fec-86bc-e08dd5847ce2', '95f54451-3a5a-492c-8e32-167e9b870bff', '9624360a-fadd-45d1-aa4b-73433756aeeb', '9c248123-f5e3-40cb-8cbe-ba675a9da98f', '9df5c3e8-4cd5-4de6-b251-2dc12aae6afd', 'a480ca62-ecdd-47fc-96f7-5568eb817e3d', 'ac9a1e6b-1aa9-4c6d-bea8-0d0cbfff4798', 'b3cbcc64-8ad9-4eef-a30e-2d3fa202c654', 'ba5aa932-eaa1-4c0a-843a-bedb3464adef', 'c17aa5c5-af4a-43ac-a5ab-fbe522fd1417', 'c186e8f6-42e1-4bb8-8fe3-039e0cd02532', 'c576e126-dac0-49c7-a7e0-5d71807adc2a', 'ccbbd48b-8fbf-4c2a-8783-aed043e83660', 'cd2674fb-5bd5-4325-b5c2-5f6d59e3a914', 'ced1da0c-1373-4116-bac2-dc4cc8227f04', 'd0bbf973-4708-42b7-a2a0-04b564023015', 'd34584d4-44fd-4172-a54b-ec903cbe1584', 'd4232e7b-fa10-40df-9fb3-76e7c205368b', 'd87c2b20-1112-4e02-ad05-25c86d8958e2', 'daf0a946-7c91-4bb3-8453-070ee2e26f10', 'decdea35-7648-4e74-9f23-4255baec84f1', 'e45a03a2-923b-40d7-8ad9-f60b0fe9c5f8', 'e4ae7adc-77f1-4efc-bf39-ca1a694959e7', 'e51cf1a8-4c07-4be2-a57f-40de8864d44c', 'e9de7712-cae4-44a0-8f7a-32188670e9c9', 'ee2c0c9d-cb57-42a1-86cd-a6896182b20c', 'ef789fc0-c5ab-4ec9-a0ea-c441ffe90799', 'f84bdd41-38cc-4d89-a8c9-b9485492c288', 'faca0a52-35fe-4c97-821b-07d5a22b872a']",Modeling and Learning Distributed Word Representation with Metadata for Question Retrieval,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017
1418,"We propose a new multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression (GPR) approach for prediction of random fields based on observations of surrogate models or hierarchies of surrogate models. Our method builds upon recent work on recursive Bayesian techniques, in particular recursive co-kriging, and extends it to vector-valued fields and various types of covariances, including separable and non-separable ones. The framework we propose is general and can be used to perform uncertainty propagation and quantification in model-based simulations, multi-fidelity data fusion, and surrogate-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed recursive GPR techniques through various examples. Specifically, we study the stochastic Burgers equation and the stochastic Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations describing natural convection within a square enclosure. In both cases we find that the standard deviation of the Gaussian predictors as well as the absolute errors relative to benchmark stochastic solutions are very small, suggesting that the proposed multi-fidelity GPR approaches can yield highly accurate results.","['Lucia Parussini', 'Daniele Venturi', 'Paris Perdikaris', 'George Em Karniadakis']",78a1b6c5-efe2-4606-a144-eeb91586efcb,0,"['01f6bb39-9bc7-4b4a-b7d5-6bd431d7dda3', '108d7f59-90d4-46c2-b6c0-eeff1db24fcf', '10c4e00f-fe7f-449b-b3b7-2c6d3ce59c41', '1d94a763-f845-4b3f-b336-5a44255c7d23', '69f24be9-fd65-45a3-9029-fde889f3ae76', '6b205ebd-791e-4c60-9380-fb8711bdf797', '6e880f49-f625-44c5-87bf-7f147b36ce93', '9dc4dd6b-22c8-45af-91cb-a7d3017ce6f1', 'b9b789ba-c6e7-468c-a48b-a9aae7c12151', 'bc5be5b5-e284-43cf-b119-d36ea7f7efbc', 'f330e425-bb2f-47d1-9fe7-3387138109d9']",Multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression for prediction of random fields,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
1419,"Object tracking is one of the fundamental problems and an active research area in computer vision during the last decade. Although a wide variety of methods have been proposed, the long-term object tracking is still a challenging problem when dealing with occlusion, out-of-view, scale and illumination variation. To address these challenges, we propose a robust visual object tracking method based on binocular vision in this paper. Our method formulates the object tracking problem in a multi-cue fusion framework which allows our system recover from tracking drift and occlusion. For each channel of the binocular cameras, the coarse object state is estimated by combining the information of motion model, detection and online tracker. Stereo filter is designed to check the object candidate consistency of the two channels. The final object state estimation is determined by fusing the two-channel information and binocular geometry constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.","['Mengjie Hu', 'Zhen Liu', 'Jingyu Zhang', 'Guangjun Zhang']",d319ad4b-d5b1-4d0b-98b5-ba9f56fe135b,0,"['02a68609-a242-4c7c-ae3f-ece5353db458', '08bad2e9-cc12-4368-91f7-4aa8b45116c6', '1fca8de2-a69f-493e-b1b3-41f524e21155', '20573ead-fdb0-4f69-b390-06add1702e73', '2eb05030-f1cd-46e6-9a12-50002839f809', '3ed17ffd-b416-470a-973a-77d7085a3503', '418b1f9a-1cfe-4aea-81b7-1bb89121a492', '433969bb-d29f-4cac-83a5-ccfb5c6c7b4e', '4beff121-d66f-4048-a832-5200294d17c4', '59b31740-3fbc-4672-a1cb-de34c05f08cf', '5ea6e082-6427-4ac3-ac85-95f9232c8213', '5f838641-f367-4b45-b577-8a533a0e5405', '6300a64b-4e61-472d-8e92-4daaf85c2163', '686248c2-844a-4b2b-9961-9fd0fd1c4366', '7aa7757b-8b27-4a6b-aeb4-d249bb8abf77', '81d66e46-7612-4aba-8318-33c4e7e57674', '82e14ff3-f158-428e-9e2a-6f4440bcec0b', '8316c4ee-419a-4dbc-ace9-60eeb6b57650', '83c737b8-e084-4766-ba6e-131e6a1c017c', '910a223b-1f53-4100-a600-6cce47c85f1d', 'b1d8442f-ea30-493b-94cf-b8528c87bae1', 'c5e509f1-51c9-4964-9242-491283fca091', 'cab7d992-0582-468c-b3d1-cc5800f911a7', 'd7f51f52-f7c3-4129-bcd2-59178ede073a', 'e0af11a9-b7e7-4d50-927d-14cc136f484b', 'e7c04cdc-ed81-4744-8a11-526d9ea66ac1', 'ee9a02c2-f9a5-4b0a-8980-1625cb464f22', 'f51869d5-2777-4539-863b-6828684cf5b5', 'fb366046-0620-4e4e-a7ac-409d8296a0ac']",Robust object tracking via multi-cue fusion,Signal Processing,2017
1420,"Background and objective: T-wave alternans (TWA) is a fluctuation of the ST-T complex occurring on an every-other-beat basis of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). It has been shown to be an informative risk stratifier for sudden cardiac death, though the lack of gold standard to benchmark detection methods has promoted the use of synthetic signals. This work proposes a novel signal model to study the performance of a TWA detection. Additionally, the methodological validation of a denoising technique based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is used here along with the spectral method, is also tackled.Methods: The proposed test bed system is based on the following guidelines: (1) use of open source databases to enable experimental replication; (2) use of real ECG signals and physiological noise; (3) inclusion of randomized TWA episodes. Both sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) are separately analyzed. Also a nonparametric hypothesis test, based on Bootstrap resampling, is used to determine whether the presence of the EMD block actually improves the performance.Results: The results show an outstanding specificity when the EMD block is used, even in very noisy conditions (0.96 compared to 0.72 for SNR = 8 dB), being always superior than that of the conventional SM alone. Regarding the sensitivity, using the EMD method also outperforms in noisy conditions (0.57 compared to 0.46 for SNR=8 dB), while it decreases in noiseless conditions.Conclusions: The proposed test setting designed to analyze the performance guarantees that the actual physiological variability of the cardiac system is reproduced. The use of the EMD-based block in noisy environment enables the identification of most patients with fatal arrhythmias.","['Manuel Blanco-Velasco', 'Rebeca Goya-Esteban', 'Fernando Cruz-Roldán', 'Arcadi García-Alberola', 'José Luis Rojo-Álvarez']",d870d164-9b57-47f7-8206-7c1465bb405e,0,"['0e609577-2df5-4b82-8a97-6f58a4c23e38', '10e64f56-45cc-4e97-b51d-eaa9ae9184c6', '273c1abc-3345-4464-a4c1-8ed16d17acb7', '29371648-9262-4984-a799-b7546d32722a', '2b8ad04d-8d18-494c-b418-704bc09d67b1', '52c3b0b0-58d6-45ee-9dec-92a54a74747a', '78de80f1-e596-4378-bc59-bab6136b4040', '7a4d384b-e2f3-420e-bd02-709039a7f029', '7c2c351d-1873-4630-bdd6-9dd734949feb', 'a88c03cb-c0e1-43c5-bce7-a3157d24fb3c', 'a94abf17-a41e-445a-890d-cf838ac689bc', 'b2ca2eaa-aa97-42f9-afef-fef21734b9e4', 'b49f0fe3-c526-4c9b-98bb-cd650784c622', 'bdee040c-c679-439e-bde4-7521fbde0415', 'd2ba2bee-0283-4275-93e3-a8067c08d51d', 'e420144e-71d7-4ed7-bb53-7245258b7603', 'e72eb8a9-8fc0-40d5-a1d1-5c88344beff8', 'e9ef9a4c-6188-4082-a7b4-6847ba0fe5e9']",Benchmarking of a T-wave alternans detection method based on empirical mode decomposition,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,2017
1421,"The event camera is a kind of visual sensor that mimics aspects of the human visual system by only recording events when the light intensity on a pixel changes. This allows for an event camera to possess high temporal resolution and makes it able to capture fast motion. However, an event camera lacks information for all pixels within a scene, especially color information. In this paper, we aim to recover a typical scene in which the foreground undergoes high-speed motion which can be approximated by a planar motion, and the background is static. We demonstrate how to use the event camera to generate high-speed videos of 2D motion augmented with foreground and background images taken from a conventional camera. We match an object obtained for a static image to frames formed by the event stream, from the event camera, based on curve saliency, and we build a parametric model of affine motion to create image sequences. In this work, we are able to restore scenes of very fast motion such as falling or rotating objects and string vibration.","['Hanchao Liu', 'Fang-Lue Zhang', 'David Marshall', 'Luping Shi', 'Shi-Min Hu']",bc9b59bc-29eb-4ded-9630-b1fb72dad954,0,"['35ee6bb5-4626-4f4e-b945-dcaaefe21a1d', '3887b74f-3784-4f0a-9368-d59078eab644', '4a813fb8-759b-4bf1-a735-529716ae84ad', '4f354904-03b3-4256-943c-9f18f961f039', '55902f1f-ea32-44c4-9b82-1732c88b20ea', '5718cf12-73be-4cb9-95b1-00b1f14b392e', '5ffadf36-4496-4be6-b8a8-828fa37f7757', '7242cc8e-43da-4e4b-9974-c070d1b2fbc8', '8b519a65-db09-4764-b8e3-70e8b6d64449', '8c14d5c6-0d86-434f-9e5e-87dbeff1de11', 'a84930c1-f1c7-455c-933e-2c67547ea0fd', 'b4ee49e6-7dad-45eb-941f-6eb9a975b1e8', 'bb66a15f-23c2-486c-b695-df6077e6bc9f', 'c4cc6cc9-1d80-49fb-8012-5da6c9d0bafe', 'c99b9b15-53ed-4b03-9d06-1e803af618ff', 'ca8092a8-b323-497d-bf95-66b873ae4965']",High-speed video generation with an event camera,The Visual Computer,2017
1422,"Inspiratory flow limitation (IFL) is a critical symptom of sleep breathing disorders. A characteristic flattened flow-time curve indicates the presence of highest resistance flow limitation. This study involved investigating a real-time algorithm for detecting IFL during sleep. Three categories of inspiratory flow shape were collected from previous studies for use as a development set. Of these, 16 cases were labeled as non-IFL and 78 as IFL which were further categorized into minor level (20 cases) and severe level (58 cases) of obstruction. In this study, algorithms using polynomial functions were proposed for extracting the features of IFL. Methods using first- to third-order polynomial approximations were applied to calculate the fitting curve to obtain the mean absolute error. The proposed algorithm is described by the weighted third-order (w.3rd-order) polynomial function. For validation, a total of 1,093 inspiratory breaths were acquired as a test set. The accuracy levels of the classifications produced by the presented feature detection methods were analyzed, and the performance levels were compared using a misclassification cobweb. According to the results, the algorithm using the w.3rd-order polynomial approximation achieved an accuracy of 94.14% for IFL classification. We concluded that this algorithm achieved effective automatic IFL detection during sleep.","['Sheng-Cheng Huang', 'Hao-Yu Jan', 'Tieh-Cheng Fu', 'Wen-Chen Lin', 'Geng-Hong Lin', 'Wen-Chi Lin', 'Cheng-Lun Tsai', 'Kang-Ping Lin']",b394455a-79ca-4e3c-9bb9-d2f7f928c5f2,0,"['4072d4a0-d25c-4470-8ad0-f8a6e5eb6cd7', '6d34939b-ca20-4a32-9127-669efb8cf915', 'c56a744e-9a24-4cf8-a795-48d5ef22c060', 'f2e5c53d-d40e-426e-b27f-19c860360d43']",Weighted Polynomial Approximation for Automated Detection of Inspiratory Flow Limitation,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2017

Performance on measures of filtering (flanker task) and inhibitory response control (Go/No-Go task) were compared across heavy media multitaskers (HMM), average media multitaskers (AMM) and light media multitaskers (LMM). For both tasks performance was better under low than high perceptual load conditions. For the flanker task, there was an effect of distractor congruency only for the low perceptual load and no performance differences between the media groups. For the Go/No-Go task, there was a distractor congruency effect for the LMM and HMM for the Go-trials. For the No-Go trials there was no difference between the groups’ performance in the low perceptual load condition. The AMM were more adversely affected by the higher perceptual load than the LMM or HMM particularly when the distractors were incongruent and neutral relative to the targets.

1426,"Extraction of Emotions from Multilingual Text posted on social media by different categories of users is one of the crucial tasks in the field of opining mining and sentiment analysis. Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources. Furthermore, the presented work for extraction of emotion from tweets performs better in comparisons of other popular sentiment analysis techniques which are dependent of specific existing affect lexicons.","['Vinay Kumar Jain', 'Shishir Kumar', 'Steven Lawrence Fernandes']",6d824dcd-6443-4aef-8ae7-ee0251c0054d,50,"['01c1a49e-1cb6-401c-8756-93f5d5e85175', '0b706c12-541e-4ece-9083-07c54ee9daba', '0dc16bf8-6721-43d7-b16b-1c11f472a91b', '1be35ae3-8dd9-45a6-bbfe-aaad5584fc3c', '240e5dfb-d099-4347-b062-a082a6a307f7', '4134c3f1-519d-4b24-8171-73f63103cd7c', '42cd9693-8105-4110-b202-12120bc9320c', '4a30a1ae-7069-4e06-8a44-db386b26b78c', '4aee6369-a9f1-47ed-88c9-b453c30eb831', '5396f2e8-8cbe-445d-bdad-ea6fd92d5a33', '595d6c6a-97e0-4004-84e3-e15d47ef1dea', '600f4383-fcec-4b9e-896a-a7cc0f140f96', '60d348a8-a9b3-456a-a5c3-94aef9daf9b2', '61dceff8-cf67-41d9-b63a-de5da6b61742', '6279c004-91ac-4c06-b59f-65da5f0e34cf', '68c9f29d-9f93-4367-8c32-bc073bee1d13', '6c1fb37f-5add-4fc7-b7e4-d4950ff5643a', '6f0487da-c13c-44b7-8ff5-8a4eeb04c85f', '6fa41b5c-e235-4294-9951-ab5fb1bdc5e2', '758c7f17-77f3-4308-a714-694af05f1d07', '933bfff9-4485-4954-931c-f4c0d9c354c6', '96d1f1b6-c6d3-4afa-9c9d-5194a228ef90', '9fb67363-334f-42ac-9b55-535183c096c2', 'a258d17b-81a4-45e4-8a94-cd399299ddad', 'a2d48cfd-e0e0-4428-ad25-966692fe4d74', 'a4c332a7-a59f-4dd8-bb71-999234eba2b8', 'b3527b9f-e915-4f88-9d38-ac3824e64486', 'b3fcc145-a6fe-4018-915f-90a59c72f260', 'c09c707c-5143-46f7-b2d8-5785ab3b37db', 'ca15bad7-8554-4e1c-94ad-0c7a540da5d0', 'd6da9b34-4613-443a-a2b3-ba54dca64a0b', 'd97f3da2-f1e2-4a20-8be1-1a3e2658f90a', 'db78d1bd-8cf3-40ce-ad56-7a252d4cd43d', 'e065fcc5-2153-4865-8d14-502c09d74df7', 'e7554b89-9f56-4866-ad3a-a409706c3f69', 'e7d1c507-f692-4ee0-84a8-891ae300f39c', 'f1bc67e8-e86b-46c1-84f2-82d73d5ba08b', 'f3493daa-be6b-4efa-9116-fa6386b643a9', 'f6f2c78f-31d1-4c0b-8701-5973d4c4a625', 'fd3961fe-42e4-4c92-88fe-26f91ed463a3']",Extraction of emotions from multilingual text using intelligent text processing and computational linguistics,Journal of Computational Science,2017
1427,"Methods from automatic speech recognition (ASR), such as segmentation and forced alignment, have facilitated the rapid annotation and analysis of very large adult speech databases and databases of caregiver–infant interaction, enabling advances in speech science that were unimaginable just a few decades ago. This paper centers on two main problems that must be addressed in order to have analogous resources for developing and exploiting databases of young children’s speech. The first problem is to understand and appreciate the differences between adult and child speech that cause ASR models developed for adult speech to fail when applied to child speech. These differences include the fact that children’s vocal tracts are smaller than those of adult males and also changing rapidly in size and shape over the course of development, leading to between-talker variability across age groups that dwarfs the between-talker differences between adult men and women. Moreover, children do not achieve fully adult-like speech motor control until they are young adults, and their vocabularies and phonological proficiency are developing as well, leading to considerably more within-talker variability as well as more between-talker variability. The second problem then is to determine what annotation schemas and analysis techniques can most usefully capture relevant aspects of this variability. Indeed, standard acoustic characterizations applied to child speech reveal that adult-centered annotation schemas fail to capture phenomena such as the emergence of covert contrasts in children’s developing phonological systems, while also revealing children’s nonuniform progression toward community speech norms as they acquire the phonological systems of their native languages.

1428,"While it is well known that state enterprises in transition economies were displaced by private enterprises at a macro level, little is known about whether private entrepreneurs emerged in a way that helped preserve or shift preexisting agglomerations of industrial activity at a microgeographic level. To address this question, we integrate competing perspectives on the role of large, bureaucratic incumbents in spawning entrepreneurs. We conceptualize a trade-off between two countervailing effects of large incumbents on potential entrepreneurs: bureaucratic socialization and exposure to capabilities. This yields novel predictions about how different kinds of startups agglomerate around different kinds of incumbents. We test these predictions using fine-grained geographic data on founding rates by private entrepreneurs in China’s bicycle manufacturing industry. Consistent with our theorized trade-off, we find evidence of a nonmonotonic effect of incumbent size on local founding rates by private entrepreneurs. Additional moderating effects are consistent with boundary conditions on the hypothesized mechanisms. Our results provide the first empirical investigation of the extent to which entrepreneurial activity agglomerated around public sector incumbents during economic transition. We discuss how these insights add to the understanding of economic transition as well as how the context of economic transition adds to the understanding of entrepreneurial spawning.","['David Tan', 'Justin Tan']",9a6b17b5-9f3b-4ba7-9e2e-47d1be3ed5ba,0,"['1fa7da07-6894-4c76-b249-caa33a7d2ede', '3c2b04fe-a6db-485d-8b9f-90a1480a1133', '3d48df53-8c19-46f6-ad5e-6183fce61974', '4c6eef73-853c-4247-9542-9285cb269a66', 'ae6ecd8b-4b11-4ab6-958a-6913f2f1b186']",Far from the Tree?

1429,"The identification of immunogenic regions on the surface of antigens, which are able to be recognized by antibodies and to trigger an immune response, is a major challenge for the design of new and effective vaccines. The prediction of such regions through computational immunology techniques is a challenging goal, which will ultimately lead to a drastic limitation of the experimental tests required to validate their efficiency. However, current methods are far from being sufficiently reliable and/or applicable on a large scale. We developed SEPIa, a B-cell epitope predictor from the protein sequence, which is sufficiently fast to be applicable on a large scale. The originality of SEPIa lies in the combination of two classifiers, a naive Bayesian and a random forest classifier, through a voting algorithm that exploits the advantages of both. It is based on 13 sequence-based features, whose values in a 9-residue sequence window are compiled to predict the epitope/non-epitope state of the central residue. The features are related to the type of amino acid, its conservation in homologous proteins, and its tendency of being exposed to the solvent, soluble, flexible, and disordered. The highest signal is obtained from statistical amino acid preferences, but all 13 features contribute non-negligibly in the predictor. SEPIa’s average prediction accuracy is limited, with an AUC score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) that reaches 0.65 both in 10-fold cross-validation and on an independent test set. It is nevertheless slightly higher than that of other methods evaluated on the same test set. SEPIa was applied to a test protein whose epitopes are known, human β2 adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor, with promising results. Although the actual AUC score is rather low, many of the predicted epitopes cluster together and overlap the experimental epitope region. The reasons underlying the limitations of SEPIa and of all other B-cell epitope predictors are discussed.","['Georgios A.

1430,"Existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods for action recognition are either spatial or temporally local while actions are 3D signals. In this paper, we propose a global spatial-temporal three-stream CNNs architecture, which is able to be used for action feature extraction. Specifically, the three-stream CNNs comprises of spatial, local temporal and global temporal streams generated respectively from deep learning single frame, optical flow and global accumulated motion features in the form of a new formulation named Motion Stacked Difference Image (MSDI). Moreover, a novel soft Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (soft-VLAD) is developed to further represent the extracted features, combining the advantage of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and VLAD by encoding data according to their overall probability distribution and the corresponding difference with respect to clustered centers. To deal with the inadequacy of training samples during learning, we introduce a data augmentation scheme which is very efficient due to its origin at cropping across videos. We conduct our experiments on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","['Liangliang Wang', 'Lianzheng Ge', 'Ruifeng Li', 'Yajun Fang']",96c02940-e793-4954-8643-d60bc063936f,0,"['051956bb-f64b-4fdb-87f8-3e2868b8b5d8', '092cc9a8-2f24-4e22-ac6e-92134e450856', '0e69f046-8550-4124-92dd-4ab8df1394b5', '15ee1357-dc2b-40c6-bab4-c59583378cdd', '177b7083-bfca-472b-833a-515f1ad77735', '181b14d8-09d2-4c25-8879-38229066fea1', '1fbe480d-1ee0-460a-88e5-ed9f77ee97b1', '22ab89ae-a471-409f-ba0a-796d6e6c07c0', '25925740-d8ac-4dea-85be-221d512b0522', '285dd088-2a2f-46cb-8d9d-294951c79b0d', '29214bac-9bc5-4620-9372-17a8cd9d81ad', '2a885d85-88fb-4e36-ad37-2a20b46f166b', '3173f2a5-151b-4116-bea1-91cc312d2d6c', '42c88bb6-6a34-418e-b807-540a168ce84c', '45910c92-c5fc-4a12-98a2-2e4d574e893c', '52853bd4-586c-4a8a-af49-32e9a26445b0', '65dd0b28-392e-4f0e-9abb-b5a96c28290c', '6769f0b5-4ffd-462c-8e35-84f41fd2e005', '6abcf27b-c97a-4633-a00a-04d50cfc52f6', '6dd46f95-cad2-4e02-b0f7-1c04cd64d5be', '715a016d-a243-4933-922f-eed858974305', '76f22025-9e92-44cd-96ca-8675372ed61d', '7be91bf7-5166-42b3-a503-80ec4625d940', '7ce3c57d-0f41-4597-9d32-392ad4e7d22c', '86048913-4e74-4cb7-958b-0c48c2820d4e', '9b8a49b5-a5cb-4c61-8c60-3bde6d310009', '9d34a081-ce4c-4ac8-a2ba-c9abb104edb1', 'a35b9f02-4b8f-4905-88b4-2f184e8f3e81', 'aabd3fe1-94b6-4f7d-8afe-57f5ff1daec0', 'bcd9e95e-b0bf-4932-98c8-426f9be1b6d2', 'c70d7255-6afb-4c05-a549-8a76c59aeca2', 'c87c959d-5a15-42cd-9fba-e1929d9bbaa6', 'ca9cac9c-5952-467c-b8ef-2542bab992c6', 'd080bd80-cc20-46a3-90fc-8f694bf51bf8', 'd1ad1422-940e-4b1b-8f1e-f1098aed979b', 'd2d3014e-40d4-4690-9d5d-38733187a274', 'dd83785a-dd19-41e3-9b25-ebabbd48d336', 'e1ed30ba-442a-47b4-b053-1f8bb0d5b45f', 'e2f7a74a-8430-4463-94ce-fe85dfd309f9', 'e491c2e8-8b5c-4722-ad33-98b029afb369', 'e598f0ff-9ce7-4df5-a2c2-49c77ab120a9', 'ea0481c6-5a8d-40ea-b0d4-a25469d4cd07', 'fbdfc1ca-09ef-47f8-a0d1-adaf626a8562', 'fc780759-4533-4b33-9774-746ca210842f']",Three-stream CNNs for action recognition,Pattern Recognition Letters,2017
1431,"In order to achieve both a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate of internal node intrusion detection in layer-cluster wireless sensor networks, an intrusion detection scheme based on the use of both a multi-agent system and a node trust value is proposed. In this scheme, the multi-agent model framework is established in both the cluster heads and the ordinary sensor nodes to perform intrusion detection. First, various, typical node trust attributes are defined and Mahalanobis distance theory is used to judge whether these attributes are normal. Second, the node trust value is calculated and updated based on the combination of the Beta distribution and a tolerance factor. Finally, node intrusion detection is realized. Simulation results demonstrate that the modified scheme has a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate, even when several types of intrusions are present.","['Xianji Jin', 'Jianquan Liang', 'Weiming Tong', 'Lei Lu', 'Zhongwei Li']",9f20123b-ec81-4935-b5ed-41b460fa9821,0,"['103642f6-572b-47a5-a252-9d2c3fdeec25', '15dc5eff-4569-4ff1-94c2-70fbdecf651d', '1ee4b656-7d2c-45e8-b2e8-b5633b992eeb', '3757e44e-e11a-4512-ae39-15be8c8c7e57', '4fb22fec-3a49-42a3-9922-bf2beea290f4', '8f18f42d-28a6-421a-bf34-c0903f966fe6', 'a26ecb43-4044-4836-939e-e2e8f3074ee0', 'a7cacb3d-e633-4cdf-9844-468597b2f610', 'b1807da0-1017-42d5-a4b7-bc0d63a24d7f', 'bec1ff09-3dd3-4ce0-9084-643f71b67213', 'c17f95d1-9a9c-44e0-bf2e-83876960341d', 'ee3979c3-3d0a-4870-804a-9fffce9d5a58', 'ef4c6441-f95d-46d7-a2bd-0b7815582290', 'f139f55b-9efd-48de-b49b-b9de231d57fa', 'f810f008-c795-4bc0-9bbb-81bf897164f2']",Multi-agent trust-based intrusion detection scheme for wireless sensor networks,Computers & Electrical Engineering,2017
1432,"Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are a basic necessity for all modern electronic systems but are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cloning, overproduction, tampering, and unauthorized operation. Most efforts to prevent such attacks have only focused on the chip level, leaving a void for PCBs and higher levels of abstraction. In this article, we propose the first ever obfuscation-based framework for the protection of PCBs. Central to our approach is a permutation block that hides the inter-chip connections between chips on the PCB and is controlled by a key. If the correct key is applied, then the correct connections between chips are made. Otherwise, the connections are incorrectly permuted, and the PCB/system fails to operate. We propose a permutation network added to the PCB based on a Benes network that can easily be implemented in a complex programmable logic device or field-programmable gate arrays. Based on this implementation, we analyze the security of our approach with respect to (i) brute-force attempts to reverse engineer the PCB, (ii) brute-force attempts at guessing the correct key, and (iii) physical and logistic attacks by a range of adversaries. Performance evaluation results on 12 reference designs show that brute force generally requires prohibitive time to break the obfuscation. We also provide detailed requirements for countermeasures that prevent reverse engineering, unauthorized operation, and so on, for different classes of attackers.","['Zimu Guo', 'Jia Di', 'Mark Tehranipoor', 'Domenic Forte']",3a1b2d33-990b-4066-88b1-4bd4a79a8d5d,0,"['105cab47-a5f3-4954-9b3a-375399d442c2', '17b948ef-d673-4737-9dfd-a688e34933de', '57d942c7-b4fa-4c9d-b7c5-4be9ca35093f', '5db83d9b-7adc-4691-b459-5b593f298139', '6131042a-0fe6-4691-bdd6-209b5a0919ac', '75929c73-f033-4087-a7ac-9828e7952ac6', '7a6e1420-0b42-4287-bfa6-e7f51a983818', '7baee6f0-f495-4caf-b024-b2d56d4c77ff', '8439927b-e52b-43c4-bbef-328882b5ad47', '8bf23cb2-b9f5-4d4c-8a47-fbadfcc5c998', '99a9d29a-b665-4830-9744-b2a58a09047c', 'ab7aabb2-d052-4661-bb32-2c4bb813f4fa', 'b0787ca6-7611-44f3-9a70-ffe777e51e9f', 'b095ef7f-02fc-4882-959f-3b39a5cb9eaa', 'be5269e5-3cd4-4919-80d0-f5187e5986c3', 'c3d6043e-0fa9-4385-a40a-1f836e8e79ef', 'cc69e534-07d0-47ee-ab7e-64f8ad03cf8f', 'ec40e7d2-2427-4f2c-8130-c53a8dc402d1', 'f45e0600-6549-40de-88ec-70885ca45217']",Obfuscation-Based Protection Framework against Printed Circuit Boards Unauthorized Operation and Reverse Engineering,ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems,2017

Field studies are conducted across two sites with different streamflow rates (0.07 vs 1.4 m3/s), and point sources versus diffuse sources of groundwater discharge, to demonstrate model transferability. A winter versus summer comparison at one site suggests latent heat flux should be derived using energy-based methods in summer and mass transfer approaches during winter. For each field study, HFLUX successfully modeled stream temperatures through space and time with normalized root mean square errors of 3.0–6.2%.

1436,"Allosteric autoinhibition exists in many transcription factors. The ERG proteins exhibit autoinhibition on DNA binding by the C-terminal and N-terminal inhibitory domains (CID and NID). However, the autoinhibition mechanism and allosteric pathway of ERG are unknown. In this study we intend to elucidate the residue-level allosteric mechanism and pathway via a combined approach of computational and experimental analyses. Specifically computational residue-level fluctuation correlation data was analyzed to reveal detailed dynamics signatures in the allosteric autoinhibition process. A hypothesis of “NID/CID binding induced allostery” is proposed to link similar structures and different protein functions, which is subsequently validated by perturbation and mutation analyses in both computation and experiment. Two possible allosteric autoinhibition pathways of L286-L382-A379-G377-I360-Y355-R353 and L286-L382-A379-G377-I360-Y355- A351-K347-R350 were identified computationally and were confirmed by the computati...","['Wei Ye', 'Tianle Qian', 'Hao Liu', 'Ray Luo', 'Haifeng Chen']",6621738d-93be-47b7-a8b1-6d62a5c3bcad,0,"['556effa9-58de-41f6-8943-e078a5a17929', 'b6324057-0abe-4b41-8ad2-9de94a3f6375', 'ccab0347-1d5c-4796-88a6-1e943c6826ca']",Allosteric Autoinhibition Pathway in Transcription Factor ERG: Dynamics Network and Mutant Experimental Evaluations,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,2017
1437,"Energy estimation and forecast represents an important role for energy management in solar-powered wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In general, the energy in such networks is managed over a finite time horizon in the future based on input solar power forecasts to enable continuous operation of the WSNs and achieve the sensing objectives while ensuring that no node runs out of energy. In this article, we propose a dynamic version of the weather conditioned moving average technique (UD-WCMA) to estimate and predict the variations of the solar power in a wireless sensor network. The presented approach combines the information from the real-time measurement data and a set of stored profiles representing the energy patterns in the WSNs location to update the prediction model. The UD-WCMA scheme is based on adaptive weighting parameters depending on the weather changes which makes it flexible compared to the existing estimation schemes without any precalibration. A performance analysis has been performed considering real irradiance profiles to assess the UD-WCMA prediction accuracy. Comparative numerical tests to standard forecasting schemes (EWMA, WCMA, and Pro-Energy) shows the outperformance of the new algorithm. The experimental validation has proven the interesting features of the UD-WCMA in real time low power sensor nodes.","['Ahmad H.

1438,"We consider a scenario where predictions of future content popularity are available to the cache manager. Our aim is to demonstrate how to optimally exploit the content popularity predictions to derive the cache update strategy that minimizes the traffic at the core network. We formulate our cache update problem as a Closed/Open-Loop (COL) one, which at each time decision instant takes into account the current users’ content requests and the predicted future ones. In its original form, COL suffers from the curse of dimensionality. We then find a necessary and sufficient condition under which COL simplifies drastically and only requires a short prediction horizon and a limited computational complexity. Numerical investigations suggest that COL policy outperforms any cache update algorithm that only relies on past statistics. Remarkably, COL policy is robust with respect to popularity prediction errors. This advocates the exploitation of content popularity predictions for cache management purposes, even when predictions are largely inaccurate.","['Lorenzo Maggi', 'Jeremie Leguay']",ceca4d34-be6b-484c-8d4c-cb8add40067d,0,"['0e252edb-458a-4e33-bb8b-1c50acf17fda', '22d42403-8eb7-4c8e-a8b7-c6f4a4a1fa18', '39a19c52-57dd-4084-9cb3-fb462d48bb00', '47071bf5-6c28-4946-a76c-2a7c3ecd2ed2', '497f54b4-727e-4849-a6e9-84fd675b551f', '6b64058c-5de2-4050-86a9-32518b3e8259', '7b06d45c-fb68-4eb4-a2b4-bc69f0c7bad1', '90578468-8ada-4549-adae-0550159f29e5', '9a5eab69-d92e-41d9-9001-6214da2e66ac', 'a42065fa-9e77-40e1-93ab-f57ff6179d7b', 'af93ef04-361f-454c-9481-9a1e4412f82e', 'bf6ae078-c278-4481-a15c-4fddb09d7fe1', 'cf20c05f-b01f-4860-9149-4ae8c31b37c5', 'd01e390c-356a-470d-a200-31cd3a9aaba7', 'd2206de3-a9c9-46c4-a574-0ce564979fa5', 'e2f1d419-dd78-4fe6-bd2e-834e40ddc645']",A Closed/Open-Loop Cache Update Strategy by Peeking into the Future,Computer Communications,2017
1439,"In this paper, a synchronous solution method for multi-player zero-sum games without system dynamics is established based on neural network. The policy iteration (PI) algorithm is presented to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. It is proven that the obtained iterative cost function is convergent to the optimal game value. For avoiding system dynamics, off-policy learning method is given to obtain the iterative cost function, controls and disturbances based on PI. Critic neural network (CNN), action neural networks (ANNs) and disturbance neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate the cost function, controls and disturbances. The weights of neural networks compose the synchronous weight matrix, and the uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) of the synchronous weight matrix is proven.

Besides disclosure intention, we also tapped if the respondents have disclosed their negative emotions on their Facebook profile. In this study, we surveyed 255 Facebook users on their experiences from negative life events under four categories – social relationship, work, health and monetary issues. The results support all of our hypotheses. In particular, our post-hoc analyses show differences between females and males on the influence mechanism behind their disclosure intention.

1441,"This paper addresses the mapping problem. Using a conjugate prior form, we derive the exact theoretical batch multiobject posterior density of the map given a set of measurements. The landmarks in the map are modeled as extended objects, and the measurements are described as a Poisson process, conditioned on the map. We use a Poisson process prior on the map and prove that the posterior distribution is a hybrid Poisson, multi-Bernoulli mixture distribution. We devise a Gibbs sampling algorithm to sample from the batch multiobject posterior. The proposed method can handle uncertainties in the data associations and the cardinality of the set of landmarks, and is parallelizable, making it suitable for large-scale problems. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data and is shown to outperform a state-of-the-art method.","['Maryam Fatemi', 'Karl Granstrom', 'Lennart Svensson', 'Francisco J. R.

1443,"Gaussian process regression (GPR) is an effective statistical learning method for modeling non-linear mapping from an observed space to an expected latent space. When applying it to example learning-based super-resolution (SR), two outstanding issues remain. One is its high computational complexity restricts SR application when a large data set is available for learning task. The other is that the commonly used Gaussian likelihood in GPR is incompatible with the true observation model for SR reconstruction. To alleviate the above two issues, we propose a GPR-based SR method by using dictionary-based sampling (DbS) and student-   ${t},$    likelihood. Considering that dictionary atoms effectively span the original training sample space, we adopt a DbS strategy by combining all the neighborhood samples of each atom into a compact representative training subset so as to reduce the computational complexity. Based on statistical tests, we statistically validate that student-   ${t},$    likelihood is more suitable to build the observation model for the SR problem.

We introduce sequential social dilemmas that share the mixed incentive structure of matrix game social dilemmas but also require agents to learn policies that implement their strategic intentions. We analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested independent learning agents, each using its own deep Q-network, on two Markov games we introduce here: 1. a fruit Gathering game and 2. a Wolfpack hunting game.

1445,"Cloud computing is a recent phrase in marketing for a concept which has been known for years: Outsourcing. Cloud computing provides cornucopian of gratuities for both individual users and business organizations. ‘Cloud’ is more of a notion where files and data are hosted online and can be accessed when required via a number of methods, anywhere, and at any time. That is the gist of it. Providing storage space to cloud users is an appealing service of cloud computing. Although cloud storage provides benefits of location independence access to data, reduced burden for hardware and software maintenance and many more, yet this service has several challenges in the range of security and preserving data. Cloud servers may exist in white puffy shapes in the azure, but these are not immune to temporal errors. To ensure that outsourced data is secure and is not tampered, cloud provider must allow data proprietor to periodically audit data integrity. Numerous Remote Data Auditing (  RDA     RDA       ) protocols have been proposed by researchers so far. In presented work, to cope with this problem we analyze the efficiency issues of a current protocol for data integrity auditing in cloud storage and propose an approach based on Relative Index and Time Stamped Merkle Hash Tree (  RITS−−MHT      RITS  −  −  MHT        ) which integrates   MHT     MHT        with relative index of a node resulting in reduction of computation cost of searching a data block from O(n) in Wang's protocol to O(log n) and time of last modification to data, thereby guarantying freshness of data respectively.   RITS−−MHT      RITS  −  −  MHT         ensures that the outsourced data has not been polluted as well as it assures that the recent copy of data is reclaimed. This protocol supports public auditing of data, and efficiently supports data dynamic operations like insertion, modification, deletion of outsourced data at minimal computational cost. The security of proposed protocol has been proved in Random Oracle Model (  ROM     ROM       ). As compared to Wang's protocol,   RITS−−MHT      RITS  −  −  MHT         is more efficient in terms of computation cost.","['Neenu Garg', 'Seema Bawa']",d827d2ba-9c05-456e-b19b-d33168571146,0,"['062d5c6a-6725-4603-b49c-fb92c4bd0f5a', '35f1c1f3-33d2-4c55-90a9-1f10041a3d13', '4d877deb-dde4-46b1-acda-98ed50bcc427', '5bb35582-4cdc-448f-bf52-b08c519dfe87', '7999fc9e-e492-4577-bac6-9366075bf687', 'b205edbf-f896-419d-8b1c-32960c1b7aca', 'c64cfaf8-7633-4668-84b6-415393f6f189', 'c719f290-b949-4fa7-a079-b7b93229c887', 'd6d6d9a7-6a84-4cdc-af4e-6663be9b7125', 'ed804c0f-dad5-4ce5-9da3-f69da43f137a']",RITS-MHT: Relative indexed and time stamped Merkle hash tree based data auditing protocol for cloud computing,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,2017

1447,"A network application profiling framework is proposed that is based on traffic causality graphs TCGs, representing temporal and spatial causality of flows to identify application programs. The proposed framework consists of three modules: the feature vector space construction using discriminative patterns extracted from TCGs by a graph-mining algorithm; a feature vector supervised learning procedure in the constructed vector space; and an application identification program using a similarity measure in the feature vector space. Accuracy of the proposed framework for application identification is evaluated, making use of ground truth packet traces from seven peer-to-peer P2P application programs. It is demonstrated that this framework achieves an overall 90.0% accuracy in application identification. Contributions are twofold: 1 using a graph-mining algorithm, the proposed framework enables automatic extraction of discriminative patterns serving as identification features; 2 high accuracy in application identification is achieved, notably for P2P applications that are more difficult to identify because of their using random ports and potential communication encryption.

1448,"SAMtools is a widely-used genomics application for post-processing high-throughput sequence alignment data. Such sequence alignment data are commonly sorted to make downstream analysis more efficient. However, this sorting process itself can be computationally- and I/O-intensive: high-throughput sequence alignment files in the de facto standard binary alignment/map (BAM) format can be many gigabytes in size, and may need to be decompressed before sorting and compressed afterwards. As a result, BAM-file sorting can be a bottleneck in genomics workflows. This paper describes a case study on the performance analysis and optimization of SAMtools for sorting large BAM files. OpenMP task parallelism and memory optimization techniques resulted in a speedup of 5.9X versus the upstream SAMtools 1.3.1 for an internal (in-memory) sort of 24.6 GiB of compressed BAM data (102.6 GiB uncompressed) with 32 processor cores, while a 1.98X speedup was achieved for an external (out-of-core) sort of a 271.4 GiB BAM file.","['Nathan T.

1449,"Because it has been indicated that empirical data supporting the estimates used in human reliability analysis (HRA) is insufficient, several databases have been constructed recently. To generate quantitative estimates from human reliability data, it is important to appropriately sort the erroneous behaviors found in the reliability data. Therefore, this paper proposes a scheme to classify the erroneous behaviors identified by the HuREX (Human Reliability data Extraction) framework through a review of the relevant literature. A case study of the human error probability (HEP) calculations is conducted to verify that the proposed scheme can be successfully implemented for the categorization of the erroneous behaviors and to assess whether the scheme is useful for the HEP quantification purposes. Although continuously accumulating and analyzing simulator data is desirable to secure more reliable HEPs, the resulting HEPs were insightful in several important ways with regard to human reliability in off-normal conditions. From the findings of the literature review and the case study, the potential and limitations of the proposed method are discussed.","['Y.-S.

1453,"The interdependence of surface tension and density ratio is a weakness of pseudo-potential based lattice Boltzmann models (LB). In this paper, we propose a 3D multi-relaxation time (MRT) model for multiphase flows at large density ratios. The proposed model is capable of adjusting the surface tension independently of the density ratio. We also present the 3D macroscopic equations recovered by the proposed forcing scheme. A high order of isotropy for the interaction force is used to reduce the amplitude of spurious currents. The proposed 3D-MRT model is validated by verifying Laplace's law and by analyzing its thermodynamic consistency and the oscillation period of a deformed droplet. The model is then applied to the simulation of the impact of a droplet on a dry surface. Impact dynamics are determined and the maximum spread factor calculated for different Reynolds and Weber numbers. The numerical results are in agreement with data published in the literature. The influence of surface wettability on the spread factor is also investigated. Finally, our 3D-MRT model is applied to the simulation of the impact of a droplet on a wet surface. The propagation of transverse waves is observed on the liquid surface.","['Sami Ammar', 'Guillaume Pernaudat', 'Jean-Yves Trépanier']",a05ae0a1-f343-48d7-ab18-23069ab59485,0,"['5b58a434-9677-4ee7-a0a2-05e53529713f', '7e0c0dab-9883-45e0-bc17-0ae75f3e7667', 'd86d367c-4a8a-4636-a289-bb584b104a6e', 'ddf160f3-e0ba-4708-b1fc-498e5c633801', 'ee691766-cd5a-43ae-aaae-3f34d4413d08']",A multiphase three-dimensional multi-relaxation time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann model with surface tension adjustment,Journal of Computational Physics,2017
1454,"Whispered speech is a natural speaking style that despite its reduced perceptibility, still contains relevant information regarding the intended message (i.e., intelligibility), as well as the speaker identity and gender. Given the acoustic differences between whispered and normally-phonated speech, however, speech applications trained on the latter but tested with the former exhibit unacceptable performance levels. Within an automated speaker verification task, previous research has shown that i) conventional features (e.g., mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, MFCCs) do not convey sufficient speaker discrimination cues across the two vocal efforts, and ii) multi-condition training, while improving the performance for whispered speech, tends to deteriorate the performance for normal speech. In this paper, we aim to tackle both shortcomings by proposing three innovative features, which when fused at the score level, are shown to result in reliable results for both normal and whispered speech. Overall, relative improvements of 66% and 63% are obtained for whispered and normal speech, respectively, over a baseline system based on MFCCs and multi-condition training.","['Milton Sarria-Paja', 'Tiago H.

In this paper we will explore the migrativity equation involving uninorms in a most general setting. Specifically, we will study the migrativity between two uninorms in the cases when the second uninorm lies in any of the most studied classes of uninorms, but the first one is any uninorm with no further assumptions.

Actually, one can solve either of two SDPs, one due to Lovasz and the other to Gr�otschel et al. The former SDP is often thought to be preferable computationally, since it has fewer variables and constraints. We derive some new results on these two equivalent SDPs. The surprising result is that, if we weaken the SDPs by aggregating constraints, or strengthen them by adding cutting planes, the equivalence breaks down. In particular, the Gr�otschel et al. scheme typically yields a stronger bound than the Lovasz one.","['Laura Galli', 'Adam N.

1460,"For a model with highly varying and multiscale conductivity, its macroscopic conductivity is approximated by using a mortar method. Macroscopic conductivity is useful in forming macroscopic models for porous media flow applications and in the setting of multiscale fast solvers. Many previous studies are based on the following procedure. Microscale models in each small cell are solved independently with an appropriate boundary condition and the solutions from the localized microscale problems are used to approximate the macroscopic conductivity. The size of the small cell and the boundary conditions affect the accuracy of the approximation. In this work, a mortar method is utilized to form localized microscale problems which are less sensitive to the boundary conditions. In addition, a simple and explicit formula for optimally determined macroscopic conductivity is derived by solving a nonlinear minimization problem. No postprocessing is thus required in our approach to calculate the macroscopic conductivity from the solutions of localized microscopic models. The new approach is numerically studied for various test models and compared to existing methods.","['Hyea Hyun Kim', 'Ji Eun Kim']",d986cc61-e830-4717-8cc5-23d8a3b57869,0,"['05d17208-ca39-4967-a5dc-47284ac22f6c', '104033e7-f675-4159-9171-01852d694835', '29de7825-d6bb-4748-a9a8-fb12423f81e9', '2b331e55-1789-4377-aebd-8c92aec0de72', '61f1ee7c-68a2-4193-81e9-33454cf04422', '69c8930c-9ab9-407c-98b7-0d883b6e03fa', '6a01d8c2-3387-47e7-b48e-05990b5589e4', '7055e692-e119-4f7c-b955-19c3c410ac05', 'a817c87d-481b-4467-a90f-eb5f1a9e9ffa']",Approximation of macroscopic conductivity for a multiscale model by using mortar methods,Journal of Computational Physics,2017

1462,"The human chromosome metaspread images are used to generate the karyogram that is used for the diagnosis of the genetic defects. The genetic defects occur due to variation in either the structure of the chromosomes or the number of chromosomes present in the cell. The human chromosome metaspread image selection process is very critical in the karyogram generation task. It is very tedious and time-consuming process and is generally done manually by an expert cytogeneticist. The manual selection results may be biased, and it is possible that the whole search space is not explored to find the best metaspread image. The mood of the cytogeneticist will also greatly affect the selection results. So there is a strong need to automate the process of human chromosome metaspread image selection process. The proposed approach ranks the metaspread images based upon the quality score that is calculated using the count of the chromosomes of various orientations present in the metaspread image. The ranking has been done based upon ordinal ranking process, wherein a unique rank is assigned to each image based upon a set of rules. The rule base aids in the tiebreaking process in case the same quality score is derived for more than one metaspread image. The decision-making process of the expert cytogeneticist has been emulated by using a set of if–then rules. The proposed technique helps to select the best metaspread image, by exploring the complete set of images that can be used for the karyogram generation.","['Tanvi Arora', 'Renu Dhir']",8b396e50-e96e-402b-986a-274e0998931a,0,"['12c4cb99-dfa4-49b2-98e2-c0dc52239efc', '29e5abbb-b7c6-483f-a067-94dca95d7515', '66a1c9e0-4e97-4695-808c-d35cfe8b86b4', '9108ef2e-ff9d-455d-a4b4-43627a6124ba', 'd01479fe-33c6-4e8c-8d0c-9d40aae2b8a9', 'd78c7dbf-fcaa-414f-bb52-988f0eb50296', 'ffb14ae8-e6c1-47da-81f0-8534d4c8c33e']",An automatic human chromosome metaspread image selection technique,Knowledge and Information Systems,2017
1463,"Point of interest (PoI) coverage is a potential application of mobile wireless sensor networks. The paper presents planar localised Delaunay triangulation (PLDT) based algorithm for self-deployment of sensor nodes for PoI coverage and optimise the data forwarding from PoI to sink. The deployment algorithm used to cover a PoI maintains connectivity all along the deployment. PLDT provides connectivity as well as path robustness compared to relative neighbourhood graphs (RNG) based straight line deployment strategy. But PLDT based path from PoI to sink has more number of hops as against RNG based path. To minimize the number of hops a cross-layer opportunistic robust routing protocol (CORRP) is designed and been used. CORRP uses request-to-send–clear-to-send (RTS–CTS) handshaking mechanism to select a forwarder amongst the contending nodes with minimal overheads. Performance of scheme is evaluated for PoI coverage with respect to time and distance.It is observed that the scheme adequately covers the PoI in finite time. The upper and lower bound on number of hops under zero loss and network failure conditions are estimated. Compared to RNG-based straight line deployment, simulation results show that PLDT deployment with CORRP exhibits better performance in the range of 40–10% for energy consumption and 12% for packet reception approximately for increasing value of node sleeping probability. Also the energy consumption under lossy links is less by 40% compared to RNG-based straight line deployment. Thus PLDT based deployment and forwarding with CORRP exhibits improvement for energy consumption, packet reception and ensures robustness.","['Mandar Subhash Karyakarte', 'Anil Srinivas Tavildar', 'Rajesh Khanna']",092d7b04-722a-42b0-9318-e05768eb4719,0,"['0174acb9-42c0-4c7b-8bfa-c72651fbd510', '0af670c7-9d5e-4919-b252-8aac6c08a3a5', '132f1075-fc82-49fb-afa7-fb349e569eb9', '177cbc65-1bd4-4b68-81b6-d826e4f0705b', '18820149-a08e-4fa2-ae18-dd07233072f3', '1ea02645-290a-4e5b-b6f1-70bc22e2e6b0', '223c58c3-d206-4bb3-946e-7c80e6c71f96', '23dd7fc0-1ebd-43ce-ab3e-43896512c209', '29f7084b-e2ba-4e8e-9c62-90e9ff75c156', '2a6bd7f0-1e71-45ef-ba47-66760ae38582', '3c1dd577-a7bc-4283-938f-5fb37f07b55d', '3ec3e4ef-2ff5-4ca7-877c-eeeca17617de', '42570e83-1624-4f7d-ab56-93ac67a5c930', '5d9d0e6d-a1cd-4e8e-839c-965835bf6400', '638558f1-31d7-4857-9f49-e8d9edc129f2', '6ba37b47-b08a-424a-baad-68aad892a86d', '6bfdf9a3-6cd9-43d8-9785-0073dbe96f1b', '79c7032f-ce47-45db-bee2-956124774b2f', '7e78c5e1-746c-4944-b68e-d142f3d53444', '82e3b126-b797-4fe7-9010-e50f9601908d', '8486a374-a56d-4b48-b0d4-6e132c0593b3', 'aff1db2d-f997-4925-8102-5bb9ff44a11d', 'b83c7497-110e-4480-b019-7d6605744878', 'bdb448ce-eb61-4ea9-ac83-32853d682213', 'c0f70bdc-d9ae-401a-b21b-9afd48655f5d', 'e01cbb09-7ac9-480b-b49b-e1198c5e33e0', 'e2f20b11-696e-4c92-82fa-bf495b319318', 'efe56538-e3d5-4a34-b180-3c51e224d561', 'f3267c01-b670-4b7a-a3a5-79088c0d90ab', 'f907fff2-54bb-46df-a28f-4663201013e3', 'ff5df402-a6f4-48b5-b87c-fccfe1f38bef']",Dynamic Node Deployment and Cross Layer Opportunistic Robust Routing for PoI Coverage Using WSNs,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
1464,"Recently, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) vendors (such as Altera) have started to address the programmability issues of FPGAs via OpenCL SDKs. In this paper, we analyze the performance of relational database applications on FPGAs using OpenCL. In particular, we study how to improve the performance of data partitioning, which is a very important building block in relational database. Since the data partitioning causes random memory accesses, it is time-consuming, and then, it has been the major bottleneck for database operators, such as partitioned hash join. In particular, we import the state-of-the-art OpenCL implementation of data partitioning from OmniDB, which was originally designed and optimized for CPUs/GPUs, and we find that this implementation suffers from both lock overhead and memory bandwidth overhead. Accordingly, we present a multikernel approach to address the lock overhead by leveraging two emerging features ( task kernel  and  channel ) from Altera OpenCL software development kit. In order to reduce the memory bandwidth overhead, on-chip buckets are used to reduce the number of random global memory transactions. We further develop an FPGA-specific cost model to guide the parameter configuration. We evaluate the proposed design on a recent OpenCL-based FPGA. We have applied our optimized partitioning method to a number of data processing tasks, including hash join, histogram, and hash search. Our experimental results demonstrate that our cost model can accurately guide the user to determine the optimal parameter combination for data partitioning and the optimal parameter combination can achieve    $16.6\times$    speedup over the default multithreaded implementation.","['Z.

1466,"Background and Objective:  For more than a decade, computer-assisted surgical systems have been helping surgeons to plan liver resections. The most widespread strategies to plan liver resections are: drawing traces in individual 2D slices, and using a 3D deformable plane. In this work, we propose a novel method which requires low level of user interaction while keeping high flexibility to specify resections.  Methods:  Our method is based on the use of Bezier surfaces, which can be deformed using a grid of control points, and distance maps as a base to compute and visualize resection margins (indicators of safety) in real-time. Projection of resections in 2D slices, as well as computation of resection volume statistics are also detailed.  Results:  The method was evaluated and compared with  state-of-the-art    methods by a group of surgeons (  n=5,      n  =  5  ,         5–31 years of experience). Our results show that theproposed method presents planning times as low as  state-of-the-art  methods (174  s  median time) with high reproducibility of results in terms of resected volume. In addition, our method not only leads to smooth virtual resections easier to perform surgically compared to other  state-of-the-art  methods, but also shows superior preservation of resection margins.  Conclusions:  Our method provides clinicians with a robust and easy-to-use method for planning liver resections with high reproducibility, smoothness of resection and preservation of resection margin. Our results indicate the ability of the method to represent any type of resection and being integrated in real clinical work-flows.","['Rafael Palomar', 'Faouzi Alaya Cheikh', 'Bjørn Edwin', 'Åsmund A.

1467,"Social strength modeling in the social media community has attracted increasing research interest. Different from Flickr, which has been explored by many researchers, Instagram is more popular for mobile users and is conducive to likes and comments but seldom investigated. On Instagram, a user can post photos/videos, follow other users, comment and like other users’ posts. These actions generate diverse forms of data that result in multiple user relationship views. In this paper, we propose a new framework to discover the underlying social relationship strength. User relationship learning under multiple views and the relationship strength modeling are coupled into one process framework. In addition, given the learned relationship strength, a coarse-to-fine method is proposed for friend recommendation. Experiments on friend recommendations for Instagram are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. As exhibited by our experimental results, it can obtain better performance over other related methods. Although our method has been proposed for Instagram, it can be easily extended to any other social media communities.","['Dongyan Guo', 'Jingsong Xu', 'Jian Zhang', 'Min Xu', 'Ying Cui', 'Xiangjian He']",edc1a8c3-77f4-4821-86d6-86d8047c780d,0,"['01cd69ee-9646-451c-9a64-68c94c63f5bb', '043e5a47-d88f-4354-a72e-335b9e5b3d45', '05f5fba9-e7ca-4c46-be79-df57944a8b41', '0e9eee25-3a03-4d26-a9f4-381c1870b25e', '1323877c-8f78-4b04-a52c-2dcfcbf8162b', '1bbb14f1-4372-47c3-b5c5-2da1723d28b4', '2d3d6ed8-2d4b-4d9c-972c-7d1ad6f751cd', '300269d0-12cf-4a51-af27-fc21ff3b0fe9', '3083d6cf-e3b8-4bfe-a5e4-e937c6d29b6f', '3cdfe983-b322-4c2e-b33e-601f1e3fba8d', '42babb66-0502-4c3c-afdd-4f4e6f562f71', '5df2b836-93cf-43f5-b04f-d74cdcd05d42', '6436f6ee-7ec7-4cee-b590-ffc39cc2578a', '6667e531-09df-44d1-992c-d8ae346887dc', '6b1786ab-d75a-42b6-8c32-dc9e72f9bc95', '6b8bdef7-4b28-4acb-a503-24c340eece13', '75af2135-8047-48ff-90e6-37ac358f1488', '8acfdf02-588c-42f6-9f1e-d5f83f099924', '8cd92085-ff6d-492a-af30-7177e861eafb', '9ae0142d-b12f-42b1-ac48-d655fdec233f', '9f81505f-6782-43d5-80dc-8ee9d0ecd6a1', 'a199201b-e387-43ed-9c4b-8b4a0c9478bf', 'a48c1532-18de-4f41-9daf-c52dfc4e2f24', 'a5ad0a14-ce3f-4007-bbca-2dfa23f8d32d', 'a754444c-9553-4953-9950-695a473cfa8d', 'a8fb33ba-f1fc-4658-8351-38aafa57d3ad', 'b336dab8-0c89-4100-896b-c01ada791b11', 'b715cd7e-9df6-4a5d-bf90-d132cfa21b95', 'bb6d48d2-0d8f-4c7c-8ebe-4872298b2070', 'ed94c215-e378-4bdc-bbd2-36c0bc420573', 'f0988d82-1f70-46c1-b8dc-923048427293', 'fcfff3de-fda2-43eb-ae32-c24b391f4c76', 'ffc37930-8cf2-4165-9813-84e0976cf24f']",User relationship strength modeling for friend recommendation on Instagram,Neurocomputing,2017

To this end we propose a new queuing mechanism based on the decoupling of EDCA and DL-MU-MIMO scheduling (DEMS) to avoid head-of-line blocking. We show that DEMS outperforms traditional 802.11ac scheduling based on first in, first out transmission queues.

1469,"Full-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (FD-MIMO) systems, whereby each base station is equipped with a uniformly spaced rectangular antenna array (URA), provides a practical means of realizing massive MIMO systems. However, the spectral efficiency of URA is considerably lower than that of its uniformly spaced linear array counterpart having the same number of antenna elements. In this paper, we first introduce a discrete angular resolution metric for quantifying the low resolution of URA in the antenna-elevation domain. This motivates us to propose a novel antenna device design, referred to as the structured non-uniformly spaced rectangular array (NURA), in which the antenna elements are non-uniformly distributed in the elevation-angle domain. Specifically, we conceive a structured NURA device for which the nonuniform distribution of the elevation-domain antenna elements is controlled by a single parameter. The design of the optimally structured NURA for the given nonlinear antenna-element-positioning function then becomes a single-parameter optimization, namely, that of maximizing the spectral efficiency of the FD-MIMO system, which can be solved efficiently. Our simulation results demonstrate that our structured NURA design significantly outperforms the standard URA in terms of achievable spectral efficiency. Our proposed structured NURA design therefore offers an effective practical framework for enhancing the achievable performance of FD-MIMO systems.","['Wendong Liu', 'Zhaocheng Wang', 'Chen Sun', 'Sheng Chen', 'Lajos Hanzo']",1f19f1bb-0671-4b36-8d8c-7da5c8deaf6d,0,"['0f6ee504-7ba9-486d-a034-8e311301698d', '1566cdd5-d68b-4425-b932-6dbe332a081c', '1d4ac079-b017-474e-8f04-121dbb6e0b76', '24420fb1-da1e-4a20-b592-db277f34ad56', '2a440d29-32ab-4702-af5c-864a9445c9f4', '4c9ac99e-690e-4d66-aba4-9189d0de1897', '5319c8d1-2010-47ba-aeba-53bbf55f1144', '646871e4-f86a-4501-aa86-ca215cb4ea89', '6de05dcb-2e39-46d2-bf91-d7bd8f59ca21', '70f91a3a-c03b-4b52-8e32-37da014c33ab', '7757c456-2228-416d-955d-c7a2eaf65e7a', '8c4c620d-1db4-4c3f-8d5d-aa2d3cec407c', '99d4c119-b99d-4931-a343-dc048cd562ca', '9af0e1e6-fa91-491d-b7eb-5ad6b48c9fee', 'a09d2f99-0419-435c-a879-48e66c5ec606', 'ad93a8cf-7157-4e38-8028-6acf2850e67a', 'ce5a0e1f-3292-4e42-abe8-6930911f6b67', 'ddd16395-285d-43ce-832e-f291935ad2dd', 'e6cbf12b-3e69-4a54-87d9-f5a22e034012', 'f149f371-b8bf-48cb-9e7e-6d72de164e70']",Structured Non-Uniformly Spaced Rectangular Antenna Array Design for FD-MIMO Systems,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2017

1473,"A huge amount of sensing data are generated by a large number of pervasive IoT devices. In order to find meaningful information from the big data, it is essential to perform pre-processing, in which many outlier data points need to be removed, because they deteriorate as time passes. Although pre-processing is essential in the big data field, there has been a significant lack of research works with case studies. In this paper, big data pre-processing methods are investigated and proposed. To evaluate the pre-processing methods for accurate analysis, we used a collection of digital tachograph (DTG) data. We obtained DTG sensing data of 6198 driving vehicles over a year. We studied five kinds of pre-processing methods: filtering ranges, excluding meaningless values, comparing filters from variables, applying statistical techniques, and finding driving patterns. In addition, we developed a MapReduce program using a Hadoop ecosystem and deployed big data to perform the pre-processing analysis. Through the pre-processing steps, we confirmed that the proportion of DTG sensing data points including any errors was up to 27.09%. Compared to the traditional brute-force way to detect, ours had 71.1% additional detection effect. In addition, we confirmed that outlier data points, which are difficult to detect through simple range error pre-processing, could be well detected.","['Wonhee Cho', 'Eunmi Choi']",f5019195-6547-43be-bb89-2429b51d02b3,0,"['2678d825-b013-4366-b2e5-1851b09c9615', '4844da10-5651-40f4-9fb2-2ec8fb15bd63', '54663edc-e373-4ede-be52-13236c185061', '584f8e61-bfdb-414e-88e4-2786cfe96d61', '9dd889be-b0fa-404f-a367-7ff09036c8aa', 'a746d63c-6ddf-47f6-80c5-15cab03df595', 'bf541663-365c-41e8-9360-f382ccfc8df0', 'd095d60e-0c63-4e06-a4fe-f562b89f22d7']",Big data pre-processing methods with vehicle driving data using MapReduce techniques,The Journal of Supercomputing,2017
1474,"When choosing a portfolio of projects with a multi-attribute weighting model, it is necessary to elicit trade-off statements about how important these attributes are relative to each other. Such statements correspond to weight constraints, and thus impact on which project portfolios are potentially optimal or non-dominated in view of the resulting set of feasible attribute weights. In this paper, we extend earlier preference elicitation approaches by allowing the decision maker to make direct statements about the selection and rejection of individual projects. We convert such project preference statements to weight information by determining the weights for which (i) the selected project is included in all potentially optimal or non-dominated portfolios, or (ii) the rejected project is not included in any potentially optimal or non-dominated portfolio. We prove that the two complementary selection rules will exclude exactly the same set of weights. However, analyses that apply the dominance structure often lead to multiple, mutually exclusive feasible weight sets, and therefore the approach based on potential optimality is more relevant for practical decision analysis. We also propose ex ante value of information measures to guide the elicitation of project preference statements, and illustrate our results by analyzing a real case on the selection of infrastructure maintenance projects.","['Tommi Tervonen', 'Juuso Liesiö', 'Ahti Salo']",52cc48cd-0ddd-4b9d-b9cc-7f0a0795b704,0,"['05bad051-8df8-4cb9-bc36-d4292e71d6fb', '066d16e2-4188-43c6-b316-6bff335b2fa6', '15ca2403-e613-455c-a0f3-3b444f5c9d4e', '181a4c21-0fc2-48b1-9244-4b8e296c3154', '1f267026-c178-4326-974f-7134488ffef9', '224731b6-5fb7-4b78-a66c-7ce4332fc3a8', '24099c98-dae2-4404-a179-4092389037cb', '2ee5148f-bd10-494a-a463-857496e65938', '4a08c61a-109c-426e-9593-22bb91ef3cbd', '53be76d4-2b20-41d1-bd03-cffa7e39a41e', '638735c5-b55c-43ad-9ad2-94d12a66fe45', '6c3fb0c8-a334-4020-bc45-faa5ab4e68b4', '7789ea0f-5ae9-4ea7-b363-154c2fcd246c', '85efb1fe-4c94-45cc-b4fa-81255c56c92c', '874d8a40-0121-4496-947f-6f4cf95a5728', 'a3f4246d-3cb6-4964-b6f7-3657cf521bdf', 'af438817-1b22-4ccc-81f1-6c73675c7726', 'b8d85a2e-fef5-4fd9-af2a-10736b96d076', 'c4ab6050-3ecb-4142-9ce4-c03aaeb3fdd3', 'c5086e5b-bf56-47ed-9170-e44353094455', 'cce756ec-5139-40a1-b180-39c655712093', 'd20c342b-5829-4085-9e30-158921c9414b', 'd4045bd6-8459-41bc-9cd2-be2fc749dd70', 'd8fda3bf-7daf-41e8-aedb-dcad7cd99989', 'dac712f4-9c01-4ab6-b3d9-8c5c1f92992a', 'e7865398-a689-47ab-b291-2d91648583f3', 'e9da5be9-ccab-47ff-85e7-4068f4d6a9ab', 'f9ed3a9f-9da8-4134-ac3c-30e31c12ec5b', 'fbd53110-0b46-4dfd-9789-420d2e95e91a']",Modeling project preferences in multiattribute portfolio decision analysis,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
1475,"Optical colonoscopy is the most common approach to diagnosing bowel diseases through direct colon and rectum inspections. Periodic optical colonoscopy examinations are particularly important for detecting cancers at early stages while still treatable. However, diagnostic accuracy is highly dependent on both the experience and knowledge of the medical doctor. Moreover, it is extremely difficult, even for specialist doctors, to detect the early stages of cancer when obscured by inflammations of the colonic mucosa due to intractable inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis. Thus, to assist the UC diagnosis, it is necessary to develop a new technology that can retrieve similar cases of diagnostic target image from cases in the past that stored the diagnosed images with various symptoms of colonic mucosa. In order to assist diagnoses with optical colonoscopy, this paper proposes a retrieval method for colonoscopy images that can cope with multiscale objects. The proposed method can retrieve similar colonoscopy images despite varying visible sizes of the target objects. Through three experiments conducted with real clinical colonoscopy images, we demonstrate that the method is able to retrieve objects of any visible size and any location at a high level of accuracy.","['Hirokazu Nosato', 'Hidenori Sakanashi', 'Eiichi Takahashi', 'Masahiro Murakawa', 'Hiroshi Aoki', 'Ken Takeuchi', 'Yasuo Suzuki']",87708e94-80a6-495f-9af2-b83dbea421fb,0,"['5fb4d6b2-84e6-4ed7-8425-816e61f0114a', 'b29fac2e-2ddc-48b0-807e-4e99f47d7ded']",Image Retrieval Method for Multiscale Objects from Optical Colonoscopy Images,International Journal of Biomedical Imaging,2017
1476,"This paper studies the data scheduling and admission control problem for a backscatter sensor network (BSN). In the network, instead of initiating their own transmissions, the sensors can send their data to the gateway just by switching their antenna impedance and reflecting the received RF signals. As such, we can reduce remarkably the complexity, the power consumption, and the implementation cost of sensor nodes. Different sensors may have different functions, and data collected from each sensor may also have a different status, e.g., urgent or normal, and thus we need to take these factors into account. Therefore, in this paper, we first introduce a system model together with a mechanism in order to address the data collection and scheduling problem in the BSN. We then propose an optimization solution using the Markov decision process framework and a reinforcement learning algorithm based on the linear function approximation method, with the aim of finding the optimal data collection policy for the gateway. Through simulation results, we not only show the efficiency of the proposed solution compared with other baseline policies, but also present the analysis for data admission control policy under different classes of sensors as well as different types of data.","['Dinh Thai Hoang', 'Dusit Niyato', 'Ping Wang', 'Dong In Kim', 'Long Bao Le']",259b2c35-6db9-4d8a-a12f-a04fff097619,0,"['00570d6f-d7f7-41f6-8c0d-0035ccb8404a', '0883f844-5145-404e-be07-3c4a32d5b80a', '0ed20206-b962-4b0c-96e1-bf5e8f9f115a', '169d0fc9-289b-41ba-bf57-981ea669f5e9', '180cfc24-f622-4ec7-8f2c-856d62bb9862', '1fe324cb-ead3-4b17-8b73-75ae41f7fac4', '5d26a172-2fcd-4241-b4cd-a8922b1b4537', '6a84b6a2-4b9e-4620-bc7a-eb98dd4d64c8', '6aee4969-a10d-42f6-9a03-910e6b92a86a', '8039633e-07f1-4645-93e5-342a54b25215', '90904fa1-f3f4-4864-a750-3c57c401d84b', '9b35e091-cf9a-46df-bd27-182ea76458bd', 'a7c45bee-72fc-466a-9de2-9b0011c30ed4', 'ba2918d7-3b31-4c3e-95e0-a5d9bc975a95', 'bb6c2aad-3d43-4aef-8de7-aac7e17015c7', 'c55b83b9-7ee8-4559-a474-e58ae295c671', 'c76bcef4-b1e7-4bc9-8399-25343599d7d4', 'cd9df495-2d1b-4230-885f-0160664c4b7a', 'ee804134-3511-427b-a8f5-aacf434b8175', 'f843a650-d219-431b-b914-b0d38da86e2c', 'f8cb6779-0ff3-4261-8f05-481855a18678']",Optimal Data Scheduling and Admission Control for Backscatter Sensor Networks,IEEE Transactions on Communications,2017

1478,"In this paper we present a procedure allowing the extension of a  CERES -based cut-elimination method to intuitionistic logic. Previous results concerning this problem manage to capture fragments of intuitionistic logic, but in many essential cases structural constraints were violated during normal form construction resulting in a classical proof. The heart of the  CERES  method is the resolution calculus, which ignores the structural constraints of the well known intuitionistic sequent calculi. We propose, as a method of avoiding the structural violations, the generalization of resolution from the resolving of clauses to the resolving of cut-free proofs, in other words, what we call  proof resolution . The result of proof resolution is a cut-free proof rather than a clause. Note that resolution on ground clauses is essentially atomic cut, thus using proof resolution to construct cut-free proofs one would need to  join  the two proofs together and remove the atoms which where resolved. To efficiently perform this joining (and guarantee that the resulting cut-free proof is intuitionistic) we develop the concept of  proof subsumption  (similar to clause subsumption) and  indexed resolution , a refinement indexing atoms by their corresponding positions in the cut formula. Proof subsumption serves as a tool to prove the completeness of the new method  CERES -i, and indexed resolution provides an efficient strategy for the joining of two proofs which is in general a nondeterministic search. Such a refinement is essential for any attempt to implement this method. Finally we compare the complexity of  CERES -i with that of Gentzen-based methods.","['David Cerna', 'Alexander Leitsch', 'Giselle Reis', 'Simon Wolfsteiner']",b1afcc25-2800-4c2c-b539-72e8ca001e58,0,"['03279151-d0f7-4801-9d0b-ba00492460c0', '08a60309-4148-4c44-a173-322aead10b9a', '38393445-cfa4-46fa-983e-55f7482da1e9', '513e3082-eb8a-49ba-9d24-fd320e95882d', 'a8a2b75e-390a-4b0e-ad19-88126ec10efa', 'b3540f99-911b-45a3-9f66-eedc39c49439', 'cbcfdbd8-b36b-46c3-b831-85e91be4b10b', 'dd1c879d-0e8b-4008-9412-e2145438d948', 'e2f36a24-37c4-4dbd-9cba-0103b269f163', 'e817b9b4-e057-4326-89c5-d308c5b43da0', 'ea388c7f-fd7e-4fb1-b4b6-c0fa47bb0e4f', 'fd673313-78ec-490b-9cf0-cea4715db034']",Ceres in intuitionistic logic,Annals of Pure and Applied Logic,2017

1481,"In the real world practice, software systems are often built without developing any explicit upfront model. This can cause serious problems that may hinder the almost inevitable future evolution, since at best the only documentation about the software is in the form of source code comments. To address this problem, research has been focusing on automatic inference of models by applying machine learning algorithms to execution logs. However, the logs generated by a real software system may be very large and the inference algorithm can exceed the processing capacity of a single computer.#R##N##R##N#This paper proposes a scalable, general approach to the inference of behavior models that can handle large execution logs via parallel and distributed algorithms implemented using the MapReduce programming model and executed on a cluster of interconnected execution nodes. The approach consists of two distributed phases that perform trace slicing and model synthesis. For each phase, a distributed algorithm using MapReduce is developed. With the parallel data processing capacity of MapReduce, the problem of inferring behavior models from large logs can be efficiently solved. The technique is implemented on top of Hadoop. Experiments on Amazon clusters show efficiency and scalability of our approach.","['Chen Luo', 'Fei He', 'Carlo Ghezzi']",acdd5ee9-10dd-4300-9d4e-fdb1f07fed3f,0,"['056ff8c9-6d56-42cd-bd25-51cc2d310d72', '05e4b945-2469-4bb1-ba0a-eee9745e1575', '0895c0e6-9068-4f5f-b249-52aa071c0f66', '0ab7d263-d55a-411c-97e9-7f9f29ecfffe', '16bf90cb-d784-4690-b343-cfa318be3c64', '1826f168-0357-4629-bb10-df38c40d1fb8', '19cc1dca-7b33-4c22-8f90-306ce3781da2', '1b6d3720-7714-4826-98b0-0d77a8941b34', '2036acfe-c888-4ed7-9623-2bfe54ff3c75', '32518a4c-fbc3-470f-8024-cb7a65f1fe3f', '3f1e087f-9233-45f8-a59a-a8c4cc456a99', '4307b684-537e-403e-8064-c415fa93bb55', '43a89fdf-9659-428b-a766-e07014640823', '4c032d9f-7f92-4f02-9109-90e782286d17', '4fae7aa2-96a8-48e7-9a1e-5a6a379c8de9', '50303516-dc41-41d9-992b-ab288fecf300', '54fe2662-f4fe-4b27-903b-c9c84b1dc732', '586ade12-30ce-498e-a7a2-b65815693b38', '5b96807d-5c91-40df-b273-bb8b0459ee2b', '5bdefa02-c6dc-44dd-83d9-555cce72c141', '5e4cceb9-4da9-4128-8e3a-a3d0a1f1552b', '5f14dc1c-a71a-47ad-8390-b8a8f1c0f62b', '5fc85625-a447-43eb-a567-71c5424d7308', '673f2ef5-6893-4ca1-a03f-eefd0bdd1b82', '6843c07c-43aa-4db2-9387-0315379fd25e', '6c2d6fdb-ce12-4480-9452-7b6eb112c3b9', '75476ed6-977a-4f4d-a9f9-9753c174ec2e', '768acd0c-bb59-4d79-a1d5-e138af7f880c', '77e28e00-d893-4095-b74c-dab31989e88a', '7883bf2f-dddf-4705-9e39-ce14191f93e1', '79a042e9-cffd-43af-a3d7-1c347e56cfcf', '7a5b1ab6-7952-452b-9b7a-3999ec123af4', '7e8d4fc9-2c23-4ea7-846a-c36df92fcfe5', '85483528-b80a-44d8-b1f9-6f212b008681', '890c88c9-432d-40f9-8dee-215baeba2398', '910dae3e-4221-4c00-9dbe-7d01e9d62658', '93d1d7fd-46e4-4df4-8b3c-568a1ea82202', '9a431a4b-1381-4eb4-b761-8311250ca2ab', '9a4984f9-27d4-47eb-8bc8-0469bf540f94', '9a95c647-f232-434a-91c6-79099f179fd2', '9d714394-9011-43cc-bd48-34152e03aa71', '9dd889be-b0fa-404f-a367-7ff09036c8aa', '9e22490b-8e1c-4528-9c60-e0cfcfd4baef', 'a207ae85-0a82-4bf1-aac8-ce7db781a4eb', 'a37bac2e-5ffb-4607-b163-c26d23d30af6', 'a4f92198-9c9a-44a7-af87-d8fa19cf934c', 'ad6d819d-27e8-4076-b31f-5f2f40e558c0', 'ae26eab9-8faf-41a5-b779-bcf59548a1d7', 'b0ad0dbc-b5b9-4746-b961-1f0467ee73f3', 'b2eeb4ec-f950-4227-819f-547564f2560d', 'b7bf129a-11ab-4eab-ae66-cd9624d0ef9c', 'b8e42fad-8c1c-49a3-b54f-285d96416eb8', 'bf2f6443-a1db-4620-ba81-482ebf4af1ed', 'c4e0bd1c-d8cf-4739-802a-21ec9a87713d', 'ce3fbd04-0a34-44cb-9804-00540b200c93', 'd196ebe5-517e-4423-a021-ec7206cad311', 'd25ca23c-3da9-47aa-82cf-2719e1d50023', 'd2bb88c7-6c3c-4b48-914d-4b030aa652cc', 'dab547d1-305b-4774-9951-7c5e62181c3b', 'de55a477-0f65-4477-9be7-0c545225ac95', 'eb468120-46b4-4523-a297-67f535d4f9af', 'f9f2bd88-ffd3-4a2e-b89f-5ab9367aacf1', 'fad17a3c-096a-484f-ac0b-6500b4d0d9c9']",Inferring software behavioral models with MapReduce,Science of Computer Programming,2017

1483,"A novel kind of basis function which is defined only in a single tetrahedron element and is along the edge of a tetrahedron element is derived in this paper. Then, it is used for the discretization of the electric current volume integral equation. Compared with the traditional used Schaubert-Wilton-Glisson (SWG) basis function, the proposed one permits the use of non-conformal meshes. Details for the calculation of impedance matrix elements are developed. The high order singularity of the Green’s function caused by the gradient-divergence operator has been decreased to the order of 1/R. Therefore, it is much easier to be implemented than other non-conformal solution schemes presented in literatures. To validate the proposed scheme, numerical results for electromagnetic scattering from several inhomogeneous dielectric objects are presented. It is shown that the proposed scheme gives accurate results for electromagnetics scattering analysis from dielectric bodies. Particularly, the use of the non-conformal meshes greatly improves the solution efficiency of volume integral equation for high-contrast permittivity or multiscale cases.","['Liming Zhang', 'Ali Deng', 'Minghong Wang', 'Xianzhu Meng']",6e4721a0-ce12-4e2e-b7a5-294c037d496a,0,"['26cc097d-a938-4d66-987f-9bf1c0da20c5', '6ec6ed9d-e2d6-465c-8e6e-420f46782d62', 'e8ba9d9b-fcfd-4aaf-8ac5-6bd776e548ca']",The use of the edge basis function for non-conformal solution of electric current volume integral equation,Computer Physics Communications,2017

The distributed architecture of wireless multimedia sensor networks was adopted to obtain the key frames from multi-views synchronously, which has low computational cost and memory requirements. A good strategy for distributed computing was designed to assign tasks to specific smart devices. The main contribution of this architecture was a combination of wireless sensor networks and visual sensors. Image coordinates of detected objects are encapsulated in wireless data transmission. To track 3D localization in compute vision, the collaborative synchronization mechanism was presented to realize the synchronization of the key frames and asynchronization of the packet transmission from multi-views. The received data were divided into groups by the real-time clustering algorithm for 3D localization. Experimental results showed the proposed architecture can implement reliable and efficient indoor monitoring.","['Sheng Feng', 'Chengdong Wu', 'Yunzhou Zhang']",ce9f1a3a-411d-4ec3-af14-d595db1535f2,0,"['059b9a3b-1f25-4c66-8222-7c5afef86182', '1d11c65e-d182-460b-8715-1b02b7c26d60', '2e55be47-8353-4dee-b0c1-98cf2da3c59a', '5b93fd19-ba56-427e-a831-476ff718ef22', '667db4c6-373a-4990-9e9d-b9b2d220676e', '7b1b08db-8112-4dc7-8ac0-9b83e59d1a3a', '87748c2c-d072-474e-884a-3f3cef37fc71', 'c7a8267c-ff6b-46bf-b54a-1baccd3e830e', 'c8164c08-b872-4e35-82f6-2950a7a31eaf', 'dcabd46a-13e7-4d30-a8ca-ee4e268e07ef', 'e394a27a-b9dc-4d57-ac95-3500b49c52a4', 'fc7915c8-76b5-44cc-a302-9edebe34dd4a', 'fde4a716-7c14-40c5-80c6-0717c6c394d4']",Collaborative Synchronization Mechanism in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

This paper presents an approach to design of distributed cooperative controllers for multiple stochastic high-order nonlinear systems under directed leader–followers type network topology via the so-called distributed integrator backstepping method. By using the algebraic graph theory and stochastic analysis method, it is shown that the output tracking errors between the followers and the leader can be tuned arbitrarily small while all the states of the closed-loop system remain bounded in probability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control approach is illustrated on a stochastic underactuated mechanical system.","['Wuquan Li', 'Lu Liu', 'Gang Feng']",45d77e3a-856d-46f2-a25f-d6381f5af733,0,"['01e3f504-019d-4c15-bfa4-b123953d12ea', '175fe5f2-7822-4b4f-846c-daa6082292b4', '1db66195-ad17-4e8a-a66b-96351fd0f2ec', '24bcd059-faa0-46b9-8cb8-d79a15617666', '634cde23-dd5b-4446-af1c-92ac8cd25a89', '6825a1ed-9677-4806-83b5-b1ec962731a9', '810a20a4-3975-494a-b23b-f811fceee883', '829ca90e-af14-40bd-ac62-227d7c05e1af', '96d9e197-5b0d-4edd-9ed1-9502af34418a', 'af23cc66-0f74-4d5d-b781-368eaba3263c', 'c0e7ecf7-80be-4e04-a704-0b24dccfc08b', 'd3fa3635-f240-47d2-9fd2-4afc97d23dc2', 'e35ef391-411e-4b67-a7ba-5caf41325a44', 'eee3a44e-ae2b-4382-8a4a-62a55d458cca', 'f27a9370-64fd-4b83-ab8a-3a48a1d8aa19']",Cooperative control of multiple stochastic high-order nonlinear systems,Automatica,2017
1486,"Entity matching is to map the records in a database to their corresponding entities. It is a well-known problem in the field of database and artificial intelligence. In digital libraries such as DBLP, ArnetMiner, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, AllMusic, IMDB, etc., some of the attributes may evolve over time, i.e., they change their values at different instants of time. For example, affiliation and email-id of an author in bibliographic databases which maintain publication details of various authors like DBLP, ArnetMiner, etc. may change their values. A taxpayer can change his or her address over time. Sometimes people change their surnames due to marriage. When a database contains records of these natures and the number of records grows beyond a limit, then it becomes really challenging to identify which records belong to which entity due to the lack of a proper key. In the current paper, the problem of automatic partitioning of records is posed as an optimization problem. Thereafter, a genetic algorithm based automatic technique is proposed to solve the entity matching problem. The proposed approach is able to automatically determine the number of partitions available in a bibliographic dataset. A comparative analysis with the two existing systems – DBLP and ArnetMiner, over sixteen bibliographic datasets proves the efficacy of the proposed approach.","['Sumit Mishra', 'Sriparna Saha', 'Samrat Mondal']",4bfda64d-483a-424e-9418-8b4e3c545d68,0,"['00c300b2-0e6d-4f9e-bd62-08ff954915b1', '028911d1-8a8d-46d6-8a4c-06276e9aabe3', '17b17b59-78bf-493b-a5ad-51831800d2ff', '1c3e50da-16c9-4068-aeb1-7dbf66303005', '23175d8d-c973-43e4-9d82-6444e691fdf3', '236ddfdc-251d-4881-a40d-5c0d0c812e8a', '247c72b9-dfce-4fdd-a465-44c45815a24f', '2a8049d1-5cba-45f8-890e-cc1265d66989', '3482a321-c9fc-4e1e-a9ba-f783e0720f46', '3ffd86aa-8c0c-42a8-ac25-b8a07946ee28', '4074838c-c163-44cd-b239-8e836c44db3c', '47f3b62f-43dc-4a17-bd5e-91e5a22298c0', '538a8104-1ec7-4515-8f5b-9a557bf73f10', '63c0e9c7-ccdc-4540-b2e0-31d842f89718', '68c72314-15e2-411a-81d5-5b5427d961f7', '699d7a6e-23f2-42b0-b661-02f859b97ff9', '6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3', '6fb8c97c-2a05-452c-b04f-4252ac70e39a', '7203b140-bfb2-4edd-ba02-e9951799f856', '76c1da70-2949-47c3-aefa-9d703c884cd3', '7bac0015-8f46-404d-84d6-4ac1107f3142', '88955d97-f7cb-494c-9ab9-45d71c202853', '9813a182-e088-4b31-9ca6-e52806bf01ae', '9ea36e2b-1368-49ba-93ab-521abd9f1983', 'a1baba25-d859-48e8-a291-822108e1c8f5', 'a7e22462-a023-4ab6-ae7b-6eb5faa1edb6', 'aa08d40f-2000-4828-bfc5-fba0fb064fc2', 'acbab9df-258f-4164-9323-9f97339445c3', 'b8e4496c-d9c5-404a-8b6a-465f4fc31769', 'c159e0f0-94e3-49c2-a92a-ce12d5e4655b', 'cb3e7db9-4fba-4b62-9581-82b339a3bc8e', 'cff1635b-c704-456c-8da0-96450c6c1e62', 'd27fefa6-875f-49f1-ac05-6dc11696105c', 'e0f3c46d-a421-4610-9867-6e643d4e6b7d', 'e4b468aa-2b23-4229-8872-f9286464a19f', 'e5d00d1a-16ff-417a-bc03-4dc6f0f3f250', 'e703f94e-ed38-492e-91d1-ce40c7a6a07a', 'f5e135c2-fd21-4f11-a1f6-72913ce5ad57', 'f874615f-2489-4ac2-9831-e074c3307b13']",GAEMTBD: Genetic algorithm based entity matching techniques for bibliographic databases,Applied Intelligence,2017

1488,"Implicitizing rational surfaces is a fundamental computational task in Algorithmic Algebraic Geometry. Although the resultant of a μ-basis for a rational surface is guaranteed to contain the implicit equation of the surface as a factor, this resultant may also contain extraneous factors. Moreover, μ-bases for rational surfaces are, in general, notoriously difficult to compute. Here we develop fast algorithms to find μ-bases for rational tensor product surfaces whose resultants are guaranteed to be the implicit equation of the corresponding rational surface with no extraneous factors. We call these μ-bases strong μ-bases. Surfaces with strong μ-bases are relatively rare. We show how these strong μ-bases are related to the number of base points counting multiplicity of the corresponding surface parametrization. In addition, when the base points are simple, we provide tables of rational tensor product surfaces with strong μ-bases based on the bidegree of the rational surface and the number of base points of the parametrization. The bidegrees of the corresponding strong μ-bases are also listed in these tables.","['Liyong Shen', 'Ron Goldman']",adca5796-9fdf-4226-9c79-0ea471b4c838,0,"['01cf42f9-a686-401d-b993-08e1c6c0ea84', '40492978-8a09-4603-9a1b-588f9cb13ebd', '53618399-2d24-43fc-8bd8-24e55b117b04', '7db97356-30ef-42b5-a712-1fe3d2eba4d9', 'b9f9b98a-c642-4bc4-b287-6993ddd896b6', 'cb064aa2-a436-4c73-8f9d-d23472624962', 'e1264425-8621-481f-95aa-930efe477a2b', 'f0aa3dfe-c4c8-4bfd-98bc-51c36ef22913']",Algorithms for computing strong μ-bases for rational tensor product surfaces,Computer Aided Geometric Design,2017
1489,"Most businesses focus on the profits. For example, supermarkets often analyze sale activities to investigate which products bring the most revenue, as well as find out customer trends based on their carts. To achieve this, a number of studies have examined high utility itemsets (HUI). Traditional association rule mining algorithms only generate a set of highly frequent rules, but these rules do not provide useful answers for what the high utility association rules are. Therefore, Sahoo et al. (2015) proposed an approach to generate utility-based non-redundant high utility association rules and a method for reconstructing all high utility association rules. This approach includes three phases: (1) mining high utility closed itemsets (HUCI) and generators; (2) generating high utility generic basic (HGB) association rules; and (3) mining all high utility association rules based on HGB. The third phase of this approach consumes more time when the HGB list is large and each rule in HGB has many items in both antecedent and consequent. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose an algorithm for mining high utility association rules using a lattice. Our approach has two phases: (1) building a high utility itemsets lattice (HUIL) from a set of high utility itemsets; and (2) mining all high utility association rules (HARs) from the HUIL. The experimental results show that mining HARs using HUIL is more efficient than mining HARs from HGB (which is generated from HUCI and generators) in terms of runtime and memory usage.","['Thang Mai', 'Bay Vo', 'Loan T.T.

1491,"ABSTRACTMotivated by the theoretical analysis of the effects of nonlinear viscous damping on vibration isolation using the output frequency response function approach, the output frequency response function approach is employed to investigate the effects of the nonlinear fractional order damping on vibration isolation based on Volterra series in the frequency domain. First, the recursive algorithm which is proposed by Billings et al. is extended to deal with the system with fractional order terms. Then, the analytical relationships are established among the force transmissibility, nonlinear characteristic coefficients and fractional order parameters for the single degree of freedom oscillator. Consequently, the effects of the nonlinear system parameters on the force transmissibility are discussed in detail. The theoretical analysis reveals that the force transmissibility of the oscillator is suppressed due to the existence of the fractional order damping, but presents different effects on suppressing the ...","['Jingfei Jiang', 'Dengqing Cao', 'Huatao Chen', 'Kun Zhao']",2b27b9a1-0fd9-430b-b0f4-eb85204bd8f8,0,"['0709bb34-9e8d-4fd2-a4b5-4c7bbe9c6390', '6b5514fd-d0ad-4ce9-ba8e-7aa0296bb048', '81c62e29-408c-408f-ad0f-c6564fa64a6d', '9817d2f1-081b-441f-8593-167008ff180f', 'b5a6ba6f-3c4a-4b3c-a076-22daa976fc45']",The vibration transmissibility of a single degree of freedom oscillator with nonlinear fractional order damping,International Journal of Systems Science,2017
1492,"Region-of-interest (ROI) detection techniques are of great importance in the analysis of remote sensing images, especially in target detection, since the size of the image to be dealt with grows substantially with the improvement of spatial resolution. Most of current studies are not aiming at the specific type of object area detection, and the processed images are rather small compared to the size of the raw data acquired by high-resolution satellite. In this letter, a hierarchical task-driven ROI detection method, based on saliency and density, is proposed to address the detection of the potential object areas in large-scale remote sensing images. The proposed saliency and density-based detection method (SDBD) integrates bottom–up and top–down strategies, where the saliency-based multilevel histogram contrast is presented in the bottom–up phase to obtain the preliminary regions, while the centroid density distribution index (CDDI) is defined in the top–down scheme to refine the previous results. Specifically, superpixel segmentation is introduced in this letter to narrow down the ROI candidates. SDBD is capable of extracting ROI of different objects by adjusting the threshold of CDDI. The experiments are conducted on two data sets to extract ROIs of storage tanks and residence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in identifying ROI in large-scale data.","['Tong Li', 'Junping Zhang', 'Xiaochen Lu', 'Ye Zhang']",0831de2f-12d2-4a21-bbf0-696fcf212362,0,"['148d4c0a-a259-40ef-af3c-9bf5a372cebd', '19cbf297-6efd-49a8-aba3-149fe149b324', '1fcf1ccb-a69c-4942-b8e0-d20b0ba57057', '59e1df83-b748-4510-b688-f8647ae64ee8', '69972c87-fed8-4075-900c-1407baec2462', '6d121e97-e351-4cf9-8c44-d7ab3ce9d9fe', '85dfd5b5-72bb-413d-9e78-74369aeb467e', '86b626a6-f948-45ea-8e92-8102e0dc5ef8', 'a895cf1c-9be1-42bf-9c06-76ed6536b356', 'f4982fb9-f45b-4b00-a768-4c0fb5a934c6', 'fc76d5ae-69a3-46eb-b011-a4fef93f375f', 'fd05d2b4-0b4e-4947-bcb3-cf89806677f0', 'fd14fab9-2ad3-4bb8-9d1b-285c62bbeeb2']",SDBD: A Hierarchical Region-of-Interest Detection Approach in Large-Scale Remote Sensing Image,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017

To improve the performance of the DR technique, two methodologies are used: a state-matching error cost function, and a continuous-time fuzzy Lyapunov function. Using these two methodologies, a novel DR technique is proposed to guarantee both the stability and state-matching conditions of the sampled-data fuzzy control system. Further, the proposed DR technique is represented as an optimal problem using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) format. Finally, some simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique in comparison with previous techniques.","['Geun Bum Koo', 'Jin Bae Park', 'Young Hoon Joo']",d36c82b6-f17c-4c5d-93e0-d9e4a6d7540f,0,"['064c66ee-f437-40ed-9bda-57522a43be9e', '0f38ed4c-8be0-4e9b-993a-53b52fbba184', '140785a7-1037-4d36-98a0-31fa72c00c2d', '1daff11b-45fa-46c4-ab89-df7e79f1901d', '1f32791c-d295-44d6-8075-2e000abe3126', '2269bb9f-f861-4173-9f7d-02306e29f034', '28024772-7b5d-4acd-aec2-00750c827354', '2bfaade6-d0e4-4a0b-abd0-e74a82313918', '32a686e5-ce12-405c-a0d9-cf647663e213', '39782dd2-8e54-4c8a-a78c-3d8bdd63f49d', '484b2441-f11b-47fa-b78c-e24cea91d808', '5a587b34-71d8-4fdb-9554-806bd4016c78', '5b2d7d37-49ab-42d6-aa76-de850457dab8', '5d9eb345-6d8b-4d4e-82a4-1945c219c4e4', '8a8e39d0-0e7d-402b-8495-f0c8f46240b3', '9eb26df5-9527-4424-bbd3-875103b38621', 'def56211-dba1-43d1-a52f-87ea200bd189', 'df2ef312-9756-4147-aa48-91cf380ea92a', 'e529a53a-789c-4b5c-9c9a-959515177776', 'f39dec61-53a7-4289-9fcf-81715461063e', 'f65f25ca-a6c0-4aca-82af-6814219b1128', 'fa7e2c5a-2d69-4def-879f-009e35b96873', 'fd656e26-1616-40e7-8be0-2f6d56b852e9']",An improved digital redesign for sampled-data fuzzy control systems: Fuzzy Lyapunov function approach,Information Sciences,2017
1494,"We investigate the connection between local and global dynamics of two N-degree of freedom Hamiltonian systems with different origins describing one-dimensional nonlinear lattices: The Fermi–Pasta–Ulam (FPU) model and a discretized version of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation related to Bose–Einstein Condensation (BEC). We study solutions starting in the vicinity of simple periodic orbits (SPOs) representing in-phase (IPM) and out-of-phase motion (OPM), which are known in closed form and whose linear stability can be analyzed exactly. Our results verify that as the energy E increases for fixed N, beyond the destabilization threshold of these orbits, all positive Lyapunov exponents Li, i = 1,…, N - 1, exhibit a transition between two power laws, Li ∝ EBk, Bk > 0, k = 1, 2, occurring at the same value of E. The destabilization energy Ec per particle goes to zero as N → ∞ following a simple power-law, Ec/N ∝ N-α, with α being 1 or 2 for the cases we studied. However, using SALI, a very efficient indicator we have recently introduced for distinguishing order from chaos, we find that the two Hamiltonians have very different dynamics near their stable SPOs: For example, in the case of the FPU system, as the energy increases for fixed N, the islands of stability around the OPM decrease in size, the orbit destabilizes through period-doubling bifurcation and its eigenvalues move steadily away from -1, while for the BEC model the OPM has islands around it which grow in size before it bifurcates through symmetry breaking, while its real eigenvalues return to +1 at very high energies. Furthermore, the IPM orbit of the BEC Hamiltonian never destabilizes, having finite-size islands around it, even for very high N and E. Still, when calculating Lyapunov spectra, we find for the OPMs of both Hamiltonians that the Lyapunov exponents decrease following an exponential law and yield extensive Kolmogorov–Sinai entropies per particle hKS/N ∝ const., in the thermodynamic limit of fixed energy density E/N with E and N arbitrarily large.","['Chris G.

1495,"Features of the data-driven approximate value iteration (AVI) algorithm, proposed in Li et al. (2014) for dealing with the optimal stabilization problem, include that only process data is required and that the estimate of the domain of attraction for the closed-loop is enlarged. However, the controller generated by the data-driven AVI algorithm is an approximate solution for the optimal control problem. In this work, a quantitative analysis result on the error bound between the optimal cost and the cost under the designed controller is given. This error bound is determined by the approximation error of the estimation for the optimal cost and the approximation error of the controller function estimator. The first one is concretely determined by the approximation error of the data-driven dynamic programming (DP) operator to the DP operator and the approximation error of the value function estimator. These three approximation errors are zeros when the data set of the plant is sufficient and infinitely complete, and the number of samples in the interested state space is infinite. This means that the cost under the designed controller equals to the optimal cost when the number of iterations is infinite.","['Yongqiang Li', 'Zhongsheng Hou', 'Yuanjing Feng', 'Ronghu Chi']",1d863a29-bb0f-4273-98fc-f162ec7d999a,0,"['15776c6e-5c11-45cd-9b78-cbcbde360e44', '28552aaf-1d2f-4814-872f-b33d38172a36', '2bbdc187-f624-4f35-957f-5644bb048a4d', '2eda7075-3184-4a80-ad45-ff6376b17248', '35775edc-ea97-4396-a9fc-385a66f0dbfe', '439479de-fea7-43fa-a53b-b249100a098c', '514bc910-30ee-4466-8f4d-74bc3dc3fb40', '51c1a700-a448-4f20-9186-dfabbf064f7a', '634caf62-1023-42dc-baa5-462b8126c034', '856fb18c-75df-4b89-bf8f-a95a31c7eab7', '95f75bdb-e021-4593-8a68-ac82e035a44e', 'a94a381d-9099-423f-883d-6c5e7f5bc872', 'caedc27e-1b5d-45a2-9beb-d6b318c5f9f9', 'd375140d-9af6-4f0b-80ab-fbb82fc107e7', 'ef615c71-5201-48e8-8bce-6c09f1fe5ab7', 'fd4e8c45-be77-49de-a6a8-a8ab1acac344']",Data-driven approximate value iteration with optimality error bound analysis ☆,Automatica,2017
1496,"Cognitive radio (CR) is a popular wireless technology for efficient utilization of spectrum. CR network senses the unused frequency bands of the primary users (PUs) and assign them to the unlicensed secondary users (SUs). One of the major challenges in cognitive network is the allocation of available spectrum which indirectly contributes to the efficient spectrum utilization. A novel intelligent dynamic spectrum allocation with bandwidth flexibility is presented in this paper. Fuzzy inference system has been used to evaluate and rate the channel (CH) quality and the SU. The quality based spectrum allocation has been carried out. As the primary CH bandwidth differ from the SU and in the case, the SU bandwidth is lower to PU, accommodation of more than one secondary CH into primary is possible. To utilize this facility, bandwidth flexibility is incorporated in the intelligent spectrum allocation. The intelligent spectrum allocation techniques are compared with the sequence based method of spectrum allocation and priority based allocation. The quality measures utilized for comparison are service rate, average packet loss and average delay. On these measures intelligent dynamic bandwidth flexible spectrum allocation method is found to be better, compared to other three methods.","['T. Veeramakali', 'S. Jayashri', 'S.

1497,"Aims. Predicting the risk of severity at an early stage in an individual patient will be invaluable in preventing morbidity and mortality caused by dengue. We hypothesized that such predictions are possible by analyzing multiple parameters using mathematical modeling. Methodology. Data from 11 adult patients with dengue fever (DF) and 25 patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were analyzed. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed to study the characteristics and interactions of parameters using dengue NS1 antigen levels, dengue IgG antibody levels, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts. Fuzzy logic fundamentals were used to map the risk of developing severe forms of dengue. The cumulative effects of the parameters were incorporated using the Hamacher and the OWA operators. Results. The operator classified the patients according to the severity level during the time period of 96 hours to 120 hours after the onset of fever. The accuracy ranged from 53% to 89%. Conclusion. The results show a robust mathematical model that explains the evolution from dengue to its serious forms in individual patients. The model allows prediction of severe cases of dengue which could be useful for optimal management of patients during a dengue outbreak. Further analysis of the model may also deepen our understanding of the pathways towards severe illness.","['M. K.

1498,"Several techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of Parallel Discrete Event Simulation platforms relying on the Time Warp (optimistic) synchronization protocol. Among them we can mention optimized approaches for state restore, as well as techniques for load balancing or (dynamically) controlling the speculation degree, the latter being specifically targeted at reducing the incidence of causality errors leading to waste of computation. However, in state-of-the-art Time Warp systems, events’ processing is not preemptable, which may prevent the possibility to promptly react to the injection of higher priority (say, lower timestamp) events. Delaying the processing of these events may, in turn, give rise to higher incidence of incorrect speculation. In this article, we present the design and realization of a fine-grain time-sharing Time Warp system, to be run on multi-core Linux machines, which makes systematic use of event preemption in order to dynamically reassign the CPU to higher priority events/tasks. Our proposal is based on a truly dual mode execution, application versus platform, which includes a timer-interrupt-based support for bringing control back to platform mode for possible CPU reassignment according to very fine grain periods. The latter facility is offered by an ad-hoc timer-interrupt management module for Linux, which we release, together with the overall time-sharing support, within the open source ROOT-Sim platform. An experimental assessment based on the classical PHOLD benchmark and two real-world models is presented, which shows how our proposal effectively leads to the reduction of the incidence of causality errors, especially when running with higher degrees of parallelism.","['Alessandro Pellegrini', 'Francesco Quaglia']",d587256c-14f3-41d7-b6a7-e0b5abf31492,0,"['0cbbd08b-5768-49b2-9c0a-90a78fc23e0b', '15b4568c-aae3-41ee-b7fb-07c4d5151e3f', '212687c8-10c6-462b-9886-a7d7c9130066', '29745eaf-e685-4483-804f-0e986c941b30', '35da04d6-c9d2-4461-9b61-83990c4c84ef', '3b514f16-998d-462f-923d-e84d8afd6c9a', '42a7e4a7-d5c6-4044-8083-c134404ece80', '42d1839a-a458-470e-8075-522c5fcdfe15', '4c911de0-a71d-4bc0-b957-4619ad7e3ff6', '5731668f-8a46-49d8-ad85-bbb911b05443', '5c106d40-92a9-4c3f-ad48-b1f97ee2a9b3', '5e5fe3c2-af37-4de4-ade0-105ae1359d65', '5e9a6909-bfe3-422b-b140-dfcd3811a927', '7e3a12d9-2bf4-4108-a21a-5d27e2a8aa87', '8708b3d7-76fb-4089-b92b-18572b2ad6d4', '87da4e79-2a5d-4d11-874f-75ce0eeeeda7', '88454e6e-801e-4587-a64d-702174b1c7c9', '96f130da-ac96-4d4f-b0cf-f5cf4c5a62f9', '9eb490c9-5e33-4189-a265-3dcb70bbead3', 'b1895c68-4deb-4288-9dba-345f08fd1d4b', 'b6747157-707c-4d98-8ec8-54f94e7e2883', 'c09bab2e-c6c7-4243-9d78-603042bb7022', 'c1edf4b3-bcae-4ac2-9a17-9237f6aa17da', 'c8433565-3309-4267-8c82-bf153aa2dddf', 'd0e49544-ef52-4878-968b-c954e98b2e53', 'd95040e4-6024-4e45-8cf7-dbbde1276750', 'db9462c0-4a26-4697-92f8-7d512d5f8082', 'ee101422-53f6-461d-86a1-b26596dfe266', 'f69a910d-16a7-4be6-a5f1-61f5edf8b74d', 'f6b8341a-0222-4ed4-a326-29d7d9edad08', 'fbde1424-0014-4f64-833e-db73f25a4997']",A Fine-Grain Time-Sharing Time Warp System,ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation,2017
1499,"We investigate the effect of location-congruent mobile messages on perceived intrusiveness, value, and relevance through a field experiment using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). We developed a mobile application for undergraduate students, featuring campus news and information concerning class schedules. This application also included daily ads for the University restaurant, which were either location-(semi)congruent or location-incongruent. Immediately after viewing the ads the app presented a short questionnaire to the participants for a period of four weeks, thereby measuring their perceived intrusiveness, relevance and value of these ads. During these four weeks daily ads were sent to 40 students, resulting in 107 responses from 23 participants. The results show that our participants perceived location-(semi)congruent ads as significantly more valuable and relevant, whereas no significant results were found for perceived intrusiveness. By investigating LBA in a field-study based on ESM utilizing participants’ own smartphone devices this study corroborates the presumed effects of location-(semi)congruency on marketing relevant ad perceptions.","['Arief Ernst Hühn', 'Vassilis-Javed Khan', 'P.E.

1500,"This paper proposes a new factorized  f -step radial basis function network (FS-RBF) model for model predictive control (MPC). The strategy is to develop a  f -step predictor for nonlinear dynamic systems and implement it with a RBF network. In contrast to the popular NARX-RBF model, the developed FS-RBF model is capable of making a designated sequence of future output prediction without requiring the unknown future process measurements. Furthermore, the developed FS-RBF model is factorized into two parts, with one part including past plant input/output and the other part including the future input/output. When this model is used as the internal model in the MPC, the factorization enables an explicit objective function for the on-line optimization in the MPC. Thus, the computing load in solving the optimization problem is greatly reduced. The developed model is used in MPC and applied to a continuous-stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The simulation results are compared with that of MPCs with other two models. The comparison confirms that the developed model make more accurate prediction so that the MPC performance is better, it also uses much less computing time than the other two models based MPC.","['D.

First, we show theoretically and empirically that taking the within-subject correlation into account can improve the estimation efficiency for the bivariate link function. Second, we propose a novel method involving a shrinkage estimation technique to identify consistently whether the effect of covariates is time-varying. Simulation studies are conducted to assess the finite-sample performance and a real data example is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods.","['Shu Liu', 'Jinhong You', 'Heng Lian']",ee4629bf-1e6d-4d47-83a8-c42cafa482e6,0,[],Estimation and model identification of longitudinal data time-varying nonparametric models,Journal of Multivariate Analysis,2017

1506,"Pulse shaping is used in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based systems to reduce inter-carrier interference (ICI) power and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which are considered the major weaknesses in OFDM-based systems. A novel family of Nyquist-I pulses called sinc exponential pulse (SEP) is proposed, and it is characterized by two new design parameters that provide extra degrees of freedom for a certain roll-off factor, α. SEP effectively decreases the relative magnitude of the two largest side lobes of the SEP frequency function, which minimizes the ICI power and reduces the PAPR in OFDM systems. Furthermore, the SEP possesses a broader main lobe, which provides sufficient improvement in bit-error-rate (BER). The behavior of the SEP is examined in the time and frequency domain by tuning its design parameters to obtain the sub-optimum SEP. Theoretical and simulation results show that the sub-optimum SEP performs better than other existing pulses in terms of ICI power, signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) power, BER, and PAPR in OFDM-based systems.","['Shaharyar Kamal', 'Cesar A.

1509,"This paper investigates optimal coordination tracking control for nonlinear multi-agent systems (NMASs) with unknown internal states by using an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method. Actually, the optimal coordination control for MASs depends on the solutions to the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations which are almost impossible to be solved analytically. And what’s worse is that the accurate system models are either infeasible or difficult to obtain in practical applications. To surmount these deficiencies, a neural network (NN) based observer is designed for each agent to reconstruct its internal states by utilizing the measurable input-output data rather than accurate system models. Based on the observed states and Bellman optimality principle, we derive optimal coordination control policies from the coupled HJB equations. In order to implement the proposed ADP method, a critic network framework is proposed for each agent to approximate its value function and help calculate the optimal coordination control policy. Then we prove the local coordination tracking errors and weight estimation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) while the approximated control policies converge to their target values. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed ADP method.","['Wei Zhao', 'Renfu Li', 'Huaipin Zhang']",db018641-e1b8-42e3-b515-e2437db15b03,0,"['00cbcce8-848d-4862-bf4d-8058664dbfcc', '023c4dd9-889c-4aaf-9faa-a39e8c3bce8c', '0d448c18-afcd-46d3-9345-642233cc1d26', '163d38aa-b245-4170-92a1-8d889b7cb6bb', '1dec6dc4-5470-4b89-8d60-949fb6a9ac8b', '1edba8b1-3af3-4333-8f1c-eee37a2b39a6', '2768199c-b9d6-4001-94d3-e6429c93bc5f', '2ab349d7-a5df-4007-86e5-b305889b50e5', '2fb50443-a823-43a9-941a-972ba9b995e4', '53973789-e531-4ced-86aa-3cc11229021b', '57aa5e5a-2ec2-4864-be44-b4dd48c0f0ed', '5f95fd5c-58e9-4ff6-b15c-ccc6a295a910', '653b547f-3f0e-49bf-88de-18ab06bca3ae', '9cf5dda8-859a-4087-86bb-b26bae52b1c8', '9f161d8f-62cd-4ef3-bbb8-0a2bf9379849', 'b060cf7c-204e-4443-84f5-ce9288f66115', 'c5f331e4-1be0-4e04-8854-e75c3734bfcc', 'd9162547-fd7f-4605-855d-0a3173c4b08e', 'dcd2baef-7403-40ee-b71c-824c80aba092', 'e2c419a9-aeab-4262-bc5f-edadeda4494e', 'e40a647e-bbd5-424e-9c2c-670aec9fe290', 'ef40f736-8e7c-4e2a-9129-53e0eb9e6c92', 'f271f395-bd87-4113-97ac-80d7dd6c7ac6', 'f2fb4f4c-bb88-4716-b0e1-9e4b0ad8e7d3']",Leader-follower Optimal Coordination Tracking Control for Multi-agent Systems with Unknown Internal States,Neurocomputing,2017
1510,"Canonical finger postures, as used in counting, activate number knowledge, but the exact mechanism for this priming effect is unclear. Here we dissociated effects of visual versus motor priming of number concepts. In Experiment 1, participants were exposed either to pictures of canonical finger postures (visual priming) or actively produced the same finger postures (motor priming) and then used foot responses to rapidly classify auditory numbers (targets) as smaller or larger than 5. Classification times revealed that manually adopted but not visually perceived postures primed magnitude classifications. Experiment 2 obtained motor priming of number processing through finger postures also with vocal responses. Priming only occurred through canonical and not through non-canonical finger postures. Together, these results provide clear evidence for motor priming of number knowledge. Relative contributions of vision and action for embodied numerical cognition and the importance of canonicity of postures are discussed.","['Elena Sixtus', 'Martin H.

1511,"In recent years, China’s urbanization has developed very quickly. Many scholars have conducted China’s urbanization research (CUR) and have published a large number of articles. With CUR as a case, we construct the dynamic co-word network to analyze the characteristics of development about the knowledge system (KS). We draw several conclusions from this research. (1) The development of CUR possesses small-world characteristics and scale-free effects. The co-word network of CUR increases significantly to a large-scale network. (2) Betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality of the dynamic co-word networks positively correlate with node degree. The popular nodes connecting with a large number of topics are also the nodes that occur in the critical paths. The popular keywords in CUR also bridge distant clusters of the related topics. (3) The clustering coefficients indicate that a number of topics with low degrees tend to relate to the adjacent topics more directly to form “conglobation” clusters. The network is a hierarchical clustered structure. The hub keywords play a crucial role in bridging distinct clusters of highly associated keywords and make them form an integrated network. (4) Since 2003, the CUR has begun to develop systematically. From 1998 to 2015, the hotspots in CUR varied diversely, which are highly correlated with social issues and public concerns. (5) We proposed several practical implications on the development of CUR from the dynamic co-word network measures. Beyond the case of CUR’s KS, we hope the versatility of methods in this research also provides enlightenment for other KS studies.","['Qian-Ru Zhang', 'Yue Li', 'Jia-Shu Liu', 'Yidan Chen', 'Lihe Chai']",c27067b7-775f-4824-a078-f8c3f003a87b,0,"['19f41ae2-0bb0-4da9-9fc4-4bf97c9efc76', '60ef3852-fa16-44bf-9434-9909268ba5d8', '7f2025b6-cba9-4d66-8610-47765df320b0', '8665ed8a-dafb-4a71-b2c5-fd46d2e2f98b', 'b8ec2fae-6365-4e5a-94ac-abf8e735c60a']",A dynamic co-word network-related approach on the evolution of China’s urbanization research,Scientometrics,2017
1512,"Quaternion orthogonal designs (QODs) provide an efficient way of constructing orthogonal space time polarization block codes to achieve larger transmit diversity gains without substantial increase in antenna dimensions. However, their optimal decoding remains a big challenge. This letter introduces an important constraint, which has not been emphasized before, for decoupled decoding of QODs and proposes a generalized low complexity maximum-likelihood decoder for QODs based on symmetric-paired designs. The main contribution of this letter is to explore the benefits of QODs for smaller as well as higher order designs without compromising system performance. Results show that the proposed decoder yields optimal decoupled decoding with remarkably low complexity. This letter also compares the performance of quaternion coordinate interleaved orthogonal designs (QCIODs), which provide full diversity, with proposed symmetric-paired designs and shows that proposed designs significantly outperform QCIODs.","['Erum Mushtaq', 'Sajid Ali', 'Syed Ali Hassan']",31c17819-9316-4a60-bff5-8c82ea986aca,0,"['48b385b6-62ad-4278-9325-0d47c0b789af', '549cfcd4-96fd-4e3f-a03f-54cbd88672e6', '9827d620-908e-4b6b-9e74-eac161e32d39', 'ba3106c1-82a8-44bf-9e59-ce9b1a0da898', 'f276a905-987f-4ee3-a682-01730dbf01ab', 'f5562e73-c923-427a-a988-f5ec63060249']",On Low Complexity ML Decoder for Quaternion Orthogonal Designs,IEEE Communications Letters,2017

1514,"We propose density independent hydrodynamics model (DIHM) which is a novel and automatic method for coherency detection in crowded scenes. One of the major advantages of the DIHM is its capability to handle changing density over time. Moreover, the DIHM avoids oversegmentation and thus achieves refined coherency detection. In the proposed DIHM, we first extract a motion flow field from the input video through particle initialization and dense optical flow. The particles of interest are then collected to retain only the most motile and informative particles. To represent each particle, we accumulate the contribution of each particle in a weighted form, based on a kernel function. Next, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is adopted to detect coherent regions. Finally, the detected coherent regions are refined to remove the effects of oversegmentation. We perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and compare the results with 10 state-of-the-art coherency detection methods. Our results show that DIHM achieves superior coherency detection and outperforms the compared methods in both pixel level and coherent region level average particle error rates (PERs), average coherent number error (CNE) and F-score.","['Habib Ullah', 'Muhammad Uzair', 'Mohib Ullah', 'Asif Khan', 'Ayaz Ahmad', 'Wilayat Khan']",bcec88d6-b750-4c5c-9e13-7684fc9f7bfd,0,"['07b5b87f-bffe-4bb6-9703-d7a4ebe7151e', '0e75b913-603d-4ea0-acdd-31c1e417aaf7', '126cd145-6060-4335-a92f-628c40f85708', '1b7ee959-a97d-42f2-a07c-f941dd7de8a8', '212a68f7-1b48-4e95-9497-f8292743f246', '2ac57180-0d2b-49a7-b978-35959742195f', '2f5ff7e1-4fe2-4dd1-8d82-98db6d5e40d0', '315fcfe6-a452-45d1-8bed-44184f7fa723', '4c17d65d-df2e-4c63-a5c5-8fc809fde11a', '4c1c11cc-678d-4844-8b86-f9f223c766f6', '4d1b121c-c88c-4d50-88f2-10901bf26df6', '4e4345b3-e739-4452-ac99-21dc6f74a766', '5956d866-680a-4191-adf0-f19fe0f443fe', '5af754d5-d27f-472d-b539-31f3d0cbba49', '608736f8-c1c5-4e29-b1ad-113c98b87d29', '64e082ab-cfd9-44e2-b17c-edc0e5b200b3', '656f7935-fca3-4921-999c-98241602b1dc', '66007927-813c-4f45-8cbd-08f6d10a7c7f', '6bb8cabf-42e2-4ad3-b93b-478878098e46', '8846403b-1c85-4aa7-86ce-a2e16637cedb', '8dd8f01c-8e4e-4ae7-828c-5d8b7fc4a4d3', 'a011d570-2b7f-4e0f-b41b-f53471a2940c', 'a81a9805-634f-4d7f-b413-732ef679b13d', 'accae0c7-263a-4631-b724-d58b93dd6d7d', 'b5c85bd6-27db-4b2c-8fdf-4a19f101040f', 'b7ff6aeb-b4e1-434d-8709-e11db188047c', 'bd1498bd-791c-4875-90fa-0acbb5e7baa3', 'bdd92977-d25e-4542-9ab8-aa92676559a5', 'c3facab0-4062-463e-9f33-8a120887c84a', 'c6b5fd35-7e10-4370-bf05-388ed3e21a05', 'cbc10fa6-bceb-44b0-b5f6-0fc158391c93', 'cd372b01-f370-43f5-9331-5a97bf553a35', 'd0a1b523-1228-4563-a7ea-0d14677dd361', 'dfacbf82-7e5d-4646-a2ff-f38d264f9324', 'e5ec4732-9a6b-4ad8-9fe6-95580f57498a', 'e70bc592-7392-48ab-9ed4-b63743448b0b', 'e9652a9b-7e3c-4595-a8e4-f0055c4f8ec4', 'fc0cbdf2-be2f-4ee5-9f0f-7eb230561929', 'fc66047f-eded-4172-a59d-4a4226b0800c', 'fd06d0a0-837a-4ed0-b2a4-47692928f912', 'fd4a25c7-0479-4895-be09-4e8eccf5d9e8']",Density independent hydrodynamics model for crowd coherency detection,Neurocomputing,2017
1515,"Continuous top-  $k$       query over streaming data is a fundamental problem in database. In this paper, we focus on the sliding window scenario, where a continuous top-   $k$       query returns the top-   $k$       objects within each query window on the data stream. Existing algorithms support this type of queries via incrementally maintaining a subset of objects in the window and try to retrieve the answer from this subset as much as possible whenever the window slides. However, since all the existing algorithms are sensitive to query parameters and data distribution, they all suffer from expensive incremental maintenance cost. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive partition framework to support continuous top-  $k$       query. It partitions the window into sub-windows and only maintains a small number of candidates with highest scores in each sub-window. Based on this framework, we have developed several partition algorithms to cater for different object distributions and query parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the first algorithm that achieves logarithmic complexity w.r.t.   $k$       for incrementally maintaining the candidate set even in the  worst  case scenarios.","['Rui Zhu', 'Bin Wang', 'Xiaochun Yang', 'Baihua Zheng', 'Guoren Wang']",28eda842-826a-456c-a67d-7f0d36bb6166,0,"['0c7aee54-b37d-4d8e-83a5-750cf8fb82f7', '2538706d-a08b-4e05-b488-999bc4467a97', '2cda9636-f572-4eb6-b3db-a7ca7f81b286', '2f7e8f6c-38da-4184-8657-6b5c7ed0aa6d', '3778ca73-6596-4bca-9063-099cfd3f37e3', '38e036cf-a4bc-472a-add3-12afddcfce35', '3ad0dce9-9aeb-4086-ad76-8874077f11f1', '472f0601-888d-4651-b2a7-6009d78b2246', '5c367265-4f41-4d99-925e-556d792ce1da', '68d41615-bea8-4d65-a190-74ecbf99f873', '6f0f6ca5-9b50-423f-8eba-18670f9a6ae2', '7085f7fa-237e-478b-bf2c-ba0fed0193f9', '7d3cb95d-6edf-4a2c-9078-ab95d008426a', '96ad7a58-3bfd-4ad5-88b2-188624b80819', 'a5cd0a60-052e-484b-ac64-23812bae9e41', 'a720fde8-eeb8-42c7-99dc-a2e61deccd9b', 'be2da4f9-87d9-4aa8-93ba-ad8ea461eea4', 'c63f9d80-1d81-4406-a467-ccc5a018588d', 'cc8fe80a-8c70-4da7-a2e4-bb1a38f3cfeb', 'e8911fdb-a50b-490f-80b9-f2ceb851ca79', 'ed01f07d-8e91-42d4-bd43-9e183aca26b3', 'eeeac708-c301-4294-850b-3e2fdb2becab', 'fff38bea-1203-4b1d-9c06-d6df9b5dbc8e']",SAP: Improving Continuous Top-K Queries Over Streaming Data,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017
1516,"Special attention is required for generation of computational grids in highly deforming working chambers of twin screw machines for 3D CFD calculations. Two approaches for customised grid generation are practically available. The first is an algebraic grid generation and the second is a differential decomposition method. This paper reports on new developments in the algebraic approach that has the advantages associated with both algebraic and differential methods. Two control functions are introduced for regularisation of the initial algebraic distribution. One is based on an analytical control function in transformed coordinate system while the other uses background blocking structure in order to guide the initial algebraic distribution towards a single computational mesh. This paper presents implementation and grid characteristics of these new functions. Developed grids have been tested and results from flow calculations on a dry air compressor have been validated in part II of the paper [29].#R##N##R##N#It was possible to achieve two distinct characteristics desirable in a twin screw rotor domain mesh. Firstly, it is possible to independently control grid refinement in the interlobe region thereby providing better accuracy in representation of the leakage gaps. Secondly and most importantly, it is possible now to eliminate the non-conformal interface between the two rotor domains thereby producing a single domain structured grid for the rotors, while still maintaining the fully hexahedral cell topology. An improvement in the global orthogonality of the cells was achieved. Despite of a decrement in the Face warp quality, aspect ratio of cells retained similar scale.","['Ahmed Kovacevic', 'Sham Rane']",cc55f1d1-0978-43ee-b0cd-f6f04853be1a,0,['056f2413-9baf-457f-8f17-389f1af38c93'],Algebraic generation of single domain computational grid for twin screw machines.

1517,"We consider the solution of large linear systems of equations that arise from the discretization of ill-posed problems. The matrix has a Kronecker product structure and the right-hand side is contaminated by measurement error. Problems of this kind arise, for instance, from the discretization of Fredholm integral equations of the first kind in two space-dimensions with a separable kernel and in image restoration problems. Regularization methods, such as Tikhonov regularization, have to be employed to reduce the propagation of the error in the right-hand side into the computed solution. We investigate the use of the global Golub–Kahan bidiagonalization method to reduce the given large problem to a small one. The small problem is solved by employing Tikhonov regularization. A regularization parameter determines the amount of regularization. The connection between global Golub–Kahan bidiagonalization and Gauss-type quadrature rules is exploited to inexpensively compute bounds that are useful for determining the regularization parameter by the discrepancy principle.","['A.

1519,"Studies have shown that regular video game use might improve cognitive and social skills. In contrast, other studies have documented the negative outcomes of excessive gaming vis-a-vis health and socioprofessional spheres. Both positive and negative outcomes of video game use were linked to their structural characteristics (i.e., features that make the game appealing or are inducements for all gamers to keep playing regularly). The current study tested whether active video gamers from main genres (massively multiplayer online role-playing games, online first person shooter, multiplayer online battle arena) differed in a laboratory task that measured inhibitory control. Eighty-one gamers performed the Hybrid-Stop Task, assessing restraint (go/no-go trials) and cancellation (stop-signal trials) processes of a prepotent response. They completed additional self-reported questionnaires measuring demographics, problematic video game use, impulsivity traits, and depressive symptoms. Results showed that when confounding variables were controlled for, participants who favored online first person shooter were characterized by accelerated motor responses yet reduced abilities to cancel a prepotent response. No differences between groups were identified regarding the restraint process. The findings of this pilot study might have clear implications for video gaming research by supporting the critical importance of distinguishing between video game genres when considering their specific potential benefits and detrimental effects.","['Jory Deleuze', 'Maxime Christiaens', 'Filip Nuyens', 'Joël Billieux']",ac9ce5c4-9cd3-4a9b-b7dc-52d97b6d41fc,0,"['16b763b3-ff20-4545-883d-7311fd8d8582', '66186e15-9061-492b-8590-7e8177bdfa99', '88ec62ec-1119-47df-aca9-f768a2e95938', '8a47a6eb-b298-47fa-9f26-69c089faba48', 'b89ebbb7-4f45-43db-b91d-95210eb9e622', 'd4d13250-a021-4d6d-87e7-0e3be67767c6', 'e8a35ebf-e0f2-49a8-a50b-1c5c18d0b0fd']",Shoot at First Sight!

1520,"The “integrality” question for dynamic optimization models of inventory control asks if there exists an integral optimal policy, given integral initial inventory levels, capacities, and demand realizations. One practical implication of this question lies in whether or not full-truckload (FTL) shipping is optimal if customer demand is in integral number of truckloads. In this paper, we investigate the integrality question in single-product, multiechelon distribution systems and show that integrality holds under deterministic demand but fails to hold under stochastic demand. In distribution systems with stochastic demand, less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping can be significantly cheaper than the cost of the optimal FTL shipping policy, even in the presence of economies of scale. For instance, this occurs in settings where shipping costs are expected to increase in the future and/or inventories are more expensive to hold upstream than downstream. In such situations, our results highlight the importance of stra...","['Yang Bo', 'Milind Dawande', 'Ganesh Janakiraman', 'S.

1523,"Electronic health record (EHR) systems are promising in the management of individual’s health. However, before widely deployed in practical applications, EHR systems have to tackle the privacy and efficiency challenges. Most of existing EHR sharing schemes suffer from severe efficiency drawbacks, resulting in inapplicability in mobile EHR system. Furthermore, the security assumptions in the previous schemes are usually based on non-static assumptions. In this paper, we propose a flexible EHR sharing scheme supporting offline encryption of EHR and outsourced decryption of EHR ciphertexts in mobile cloud computing. The proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model under the static decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption. In our EHR sharing system, an EHR owner only need one multiplication in bilinear groups to generate the final EHR ciphertexts based on the offline ciphertexts computation, and an EHR user can easily decrypt the EHR cipheretext without requiring bilinear pairing operations based on the transformed ciphertexts from the EHR cloud. Our EHR sharing scheme allows access structures encoded in linear secret sharing schemes. Performance comparisons indicate that our scheme is very suitable for mobile health clouds.","['Zhaoquan Cai', 'Hongyang Yan', 'Ping Li', 'Zhengan Huang', 'Chongzhi Gao']",da6541a1-1987-405c-ad5b-b53b11e3e932,0,"['1f07eed9-eee0-4ae1-ac1a-4dfb98c5631e', '29aa3b11-e863-4642-beac-f96a8fb0da94', '36d10943-4740-4eff-bfa8-bb66789fdc14', '560610fd-6f93-47ec-b335-ffbba6979afd', '5f78e031-544e-4208-a22f-22a6bc6b3b92', '700e9a72-5ada-47f8-b0a2-33c8d10e470d', '9894388e-0bab-4cce-8dc5-16014e26ca92', '9d87865c-cb45-4f8a-b056-952e9415ee4d', 'a45d70ae-20a0-4288-be51-dd4113c48298', 'b485ce0f-a3af-4e64-aaf0-2191b0477296', 'c0a96063-563a-405e-89d3-6be9595576aa', 'd3dec473-526b-4860-bd50-486d60650fdc', 'd8f8bfb0-e685-42f7-bc15-c4ecede39766', 'da219328-1f16-4430-893f-fcfc9461a50c', 'ed804c0f-dad5-4ce5-9da3-f69da43f137a', 'f7ad28e9-66b6-4902-b031-1a423cdd1139']",Towards secure and flexible EHR sharing in mobile health cloud under static assumptions,Cluster Computing,2017
1524,"This study investigates the success of a multiobjective genetic algorithm (GA) combined with state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques for the feature subset selection (FSS) in binary classification problem (BCP). Recent studies have focused on improving the accuracy of BCP by including all of the features, neglecting to determine the best performing subset of features. However, for some problems, the number of features may reach thousands, which will cause too much computation power to be consumed during the feature evaluation and classification phases, also possibly reducing the accuracy of the results. Therefore, selecting the minimum number of features while preserving and/or increasing the accuracy of the results at a high level becomes an important issue for achieving fast and accurate binary classification. Our multiobjective evolutionary algorithm includes two phases, FSS using a GA and applying ML techniques for the BCP. Since exhaustively investigating all of the feature subsets is intractable, a GA is preferred for the first phase of the algorithm for intelligently detecting the most appropriate feature subset. The GA uses multiobjective crossover and mutation operators to improve a population of individuals (each representing a selected feature subset) and obtain (near-) optimal solutions through generations. In the second phase of the algorithms, the fitness of the selected subset is decided by using state-of-the-art ML techniques; Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Extreme Learning Machine, K-means, and Affinity Propagation. The performance of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (and the ML techniques) is evaluated with comprehensive experiments and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, Greedy Search, Particle Swarm Optimization, Tabu Search, and Scatter Search. The proposed algorithm was observed to be robust and it performed better than the existing methods on most of the datasets.","['Ayça Deniz', 'Hakan Ezgi Kiziloz', 'Tansel Dokeroglu', 'Ahmet Cosar']",8e1fceed-9123-4f29-ac61-5e4741aecb1a,0,"['09b12578-d93c-40ba-9a5c-d904cb272c89', '0e215ecb-40c7-4dde-8a3e-470d5c627bb5', '0ebc55c5-1489-4c47-8554-a1bf3cacd21d', '182b6988-6b10-48cc-aacf-69ccc96e30a8', '245e4043-ccdb-457a-9be1-e120c7a94753', '30b3642a-f297-4e1f-a099-55aca7bd9894', '32a199d4-7606-4a4d-89e4-04e6eb9a2dfc', '3a95bc5d-058a-4f2d-a003-c2dcf47acef7', '408336b1-f295-4558-a68b-d864efa2e2c4', '4443ce8d-df57-4099-bdd8-15cc0cc6f9a8', '4bab8dc6-2cbd-4a38-89f0-d73e0d6be2e8', '4fb87930-7f6c-4f03-ae22-32445138ec83', '50dd56db-151d-4d62-8576-65f0ef6f381b', '530da889-2930-466c-9e7e-eb72bca4035b', '5a68f960-ad00-4121-bf1e-6d30af8490cc', '607d7016-5b73-46c9-ac97-8f50aedfbd22', '61a9f882-7438-4d5f-b077-4e1affae9fc0', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '685b313d-8a77-481e-9456-e405a1d29549', '6e338fa6-1163-497e-991e-14ad8e4ff34c', '74eb5e4e-c241-4c7e-8969-699b105d4baa', '7e6468e2-485c-4716-8d23-83ba572504de', '95fdc823-57bc-4e49-8e5b-8fac0c4cfb7f', '9ee176a3-ea9d-4025-994b-a27b9253802c', '9f4995af-e704-48ab-8717-6972a3d4455b', 'a69c537e-b314-4d17-8d46-92bbb9948e4c', 'a86fd610-724c-4764-879a-b677bb3659aa', 'a8853e43-6df1-450f-8fb9-a05db0853eab', 'bf9b9520-24ae-4c77-ab37-8ae1d53e574f', 'd32b3d87-3ccf-4070-879f-e02083477a67', 'dd9e740b-b3e4-4b6e-8f44-8c4adf3294d8', 'e001b7c6-52d3-40dc-b077-e9f80f3c309b', 'e3f27652-688a-457b-ad96-07a7e3c05543', 'eea4b8a6-c38c-40e6-b66e-ac64481dbcb3', 'effcdc42-c90f-4802-84c7-c465d332fb86', 'fd772716-e214-4caf-bc10-5ae8bd08642b']",Robust multiobjective evolutionary feature subset selection algorithm for binary classification using machine learning techniques,Neurocomputing,2017
1525,"The reconstruction of an object’s shape or surface from a set of 3D points plays an important role in medical image analysis, e.g. in anatomy reconstruction from tomographic measurements or in the process of aligning intra-operative navigation and preoperative planning data. In such scenarios, one usually has to deal with sparse data, which significantly aggravates the problem of reconstruction. However, medical applications often provide contextual information about the 3D point data that allow to incorporate prior knowledge about the shape that is to be reconstructed. To this end, we propose the use of a statistical shape model (SSM) as a prior for surface reconstruction. The SSM is represented by a point distribution model (PDM), which is associated with a surface mesh. Using the shape distribution that is modelled by the PDM, we formulate the problem of surface reconstruction from a probabilistic perspective based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In order to do so, the given points are interpreted as samples of the GMM. By using mixture components with anisotropic covariances that are “oriented” according to the surface normals at the PDM points, a surface-based fitting is accomplished. Estimating the parameters of the GMM in a maximum a posteriori manner yields the reconstruction of the surface from the given data points. We compare our method to the extensively used Iterative Closest Points method on several different anatomical datasets/SSMs (brain, femur, tibia, hip, liver) and demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness on sparse data.","['Florian Bernard', 'Luis Salamanca', 'Johan Thunberg', 'Alexander Tack', 'Dennis Jentsch', 'Hans Lamecker', 'Stefan Zachow', 'Frank Hertel', 'Jorge Goncalves', 'Peter Gemmar']",e25ba2c3-0de8-46f9-96a2-0844b11a3c61,0,"['07601de8-a596-4ad9-9718-eb2a24d60099', '07706cd0-d7dd-4460-901f-e11aaa75f9be', '11719559-b7a7-40ed-a660-c391cd154c6e', '1cfdecea-6f67-41b7-ab2a-b495044a294a', '1da7da8e-32a4-4e89-874f-c343c572c6ed', '21c687ae-f66b-4ca6-8167-9c206913a1d1', '233ecfea-ff52-4e93-b08e-a49dfbe3e7a6', '27d80fa7-6ece-4534-9da5-bd7a34db10aa', '296a4485-314c-4180-aed0-b8b525fe9223', '29be2e6b-44d1-471c-b794-a0d03bc4b524', '2a7836a2-6c93-443d-87e7-dbafa4269b3d', '2c27e0e6-dcb0-4e67-b645-6bd7be2c9472', '3198d315-bb06-421f-b979-01f48ea17b6b', '31a44b19-f4c7-447e-93be-76032623fe4e', '31d3dcad-0122-42dd-845d-01c7a44c22a0', '320770fc-dfdf-42e8-92ce-991796c3cc95', '3e7334f4-4d31-4916-9bcf-b9a61888aee6', '3e9ef9cd-5168-47c9-82f8-7b2841234252', '41c667a6-01e8-45e7-86d5-0b3cc8f46492', '50f67f82-42e0-42cf-a595-edb2242abd32', '52e6593a-0c00-4e0a-8eda-e7d703a062f5', '56674341-5cc5-4a5d-a909-dcbc40f161a6', '56954957-3eb0-4bce-b536-ee55d1f52c9a', '58e2aa7a-4ae6-4a6a-8f4c-2affafa349aa', '6141a17f-5fc6-4ca4-abf1-30451c5d108d', '6591ed89-b54f-40fd-bfad-715b7705200e', '69a51f6a-b311-40a2-8caa-4f8426fd6974', '6fafd310-33aa-4967-b42f-e216f83e0dd5', '708863d1-e781-4809-ae6d-19eca692617a', '7187cac3-ffa8-45fb-858f-ad23e669833b', '796560ab-1085-4986-9afa-5991b37fba9d', '7a5f8efb-25e8-46ab-b16e-d7a6f04df267', '80f98543-85a6-4e74-8a91-d930bd543a4f', '848bf2d0-fd4e-43a6-b40f-0be674988865', '86a3a349-5367-439c-81c9-150fd97e4452', '917f5d33-0877-4069-8f0c-b4976ddf276a', '98a0f381-f2d3-4ae6-b760-43a3cc300a3d', '9ef11d97-8bc6-43db-8bd7-27066ef829ff', 'a2b9ad86-1d5c-4ba4-a306-afb09101d572', 'a7a01782-8e14-4dd6-9336-60718abbfc0b', 'b156dfb5-1b83-4f78-9c7b-29d6fb55306d', 'c24b709d-7a19-4361-8aec-419d1a3073de', 'c3ae87dc-0f01-47b9-9de6-6ad4ec23ee29', 'cb30d336-0b66-4d0c-bb4e-5c0be85aff25', 'cfe4a69d-1174-432d-977b-346a9999e922', 'd34aaaff-477d-4733-bd50-cfbaec28f968', 'd36b5b73-1021-4564-8db0-5d364d3a0fd7', 'd44e71a4-553f-4aba-a0fb-dbc022d152fa', 'd4f37b7f-d0db-4a1e-8049-337c642328d6', 'd8babeb2-5f74-4d54-a85e-947704f9e28d', 'de7a27d9-2d29-4860-9e73-d93095e27cd4', 'e46bb6ea-7b67-4edf-8cd4-a51ce64cff19', 'e98c845f-07a2-4279-8d22-c5ee35874f49', 'eaa4a024-c254-4f5b-b249-6a989e81fb78', 'eb66fe05-5b65-4f9f-a8c6-4acdb9f95fdf', 'ebfca554-7a3c-4597-954b-07336a2e3030', 'ed2bdeaa-8014-4738-a18a-a58de8e0201e', 'ede7ae50-4f62-4fc2-b1b1-a8dcc759e5fb']",Shape-aware Surface Reconstruction from Sparse 3D Point-Clouds,Medical Image Analysis,2017
1526,"This study presents an alternative way to perform large eddy simulation based on a targeted numerical dissipation introduced by the discretization of the viscous term. It is shown that this regularisation technique is equivalent to the use of spectral vanishing viscosity. The flexibility of the method ensures high-order accuracy while controlling the level and spectral features of this purely numerical viscosity. A Pao-like spectral closure based on physical arguments is used to scale this numerical viscosity  a priori . It is shown that this way of approaching large eddy simulation is more efficient and accurate than the use of the very popular Smagorinsky model in standard as well as in dynamic version. The main strength of being able to correctly calibrate numerical dissipation is the possibility to regularise the solution at the mesh scale. Thanks to this property, it is shown that the solution can be seen as numerically converged. Conversely, the two versions of the Smagorinsky model are found unable to ensure regularisation while showing a strong sensitivity to numerical errors. The originality of the present approach is that it can be viewed as implicit large eddy simulation, in the sense that the numerical error is the source of artificial dissipation, but also as explicit subgrid-scale modelling, because of the equivalence with spectral viscosity prescribed on a physical basis.","['Thibault Dairay', 'Eric Lamballais', 'Sylvain Laizet', 'J.

The most general logic includes (i) atomic formulas for representing the truth of a given fact or the presence of a given agent at a certain position of the plane, (ii) atomic programs corresponding to the four basic orientations in the plane (up, down, left, right) as well as the four program constructs of propositional dynamic logic (sequential composition, nondeterministic composition, iteration and test). As this logic is not computably enumerable, we study some interesting decidable and axiomatizable fragments of it.

1531,"Often one would like to allocate shared resources in a fair way. A common and well-studied notion of fairness is  Max-Min Fairness , where we first maximize the smallest allocation, and subject to that the second smallest, and so on. We consider a networking application where multiple commodities compete over the capacity of a network. In our setting, each commodity has multiple possible paths to route its demand (for example, a network using Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) tunneling). In this setting, the only known way of finding a max-min fair allocation requires an iterative solution of multiple linear programs. Such an approach, although polynomial time, scales badly with the size of the network, the number of demands, and the number of paths, and is hard to implement in a distributed environment. More importantly, a network operator has limited control and understanding of the inner working of the algorithm.   In this article we introduce Upward Max-Min Fairness, a novel relaxation of Max-Min Fairness, and present a family of simple dynamics that converge to it. These dynamics can be implemented in a distributed manner. Moreover, we present an efficient combinatorial algorithm for finding an upward max-min fair allocation. This algorithm is a natural extension of the well-known Water Filling Algorithm for a multiple path setting.   We test the expected behavior of this new algorithm and show that on realistic networks upward max-min fair allocations are comparable to the max-min fair allocations both in fairness and in network utilization.","['Emilie Danna', 'Avinatan Hassidim', 'Haim Kaplan', 'Alok Kumar', 'Yishay Mansour', 'Danny Raz', 'Michal Segalov']",58fd5296-abb3-4023-8f30-e6f26eb539e3,50,"['07152e3a-261c-4815-be22-807a0308fffc', '221a51ba-b64d-4bf4-b9b9-968b9d7bd99e', '33f8696d-3238-4c89-b176-b48fba51c3b4', '496f167a-6b15-4ac2-afac-e53dc358cd31', '4d0f2c57-7f08-416a-9721-eb333c88433e', '65f5cab0-e300-4eea-9016-95d1adeeb0c5', '683a2948-2d37-4166-a0e4-546e716b7403', '91f2b7a2-0d1f-40a8-8287-cfa311e09647', 'c8771a57-de9c-44b7-966c-1ff156d3091f']",Upward Max-Min Fairness,Journal of the ACM,2017
1532,"Bayesian networks, and especially their structures, are powerful tools for representing conditional independencies and dependencies between random variables. In applications where related variables form a priori known groups, chosen to represent different ""views"" to or aspects of the same entities, one may be more interested in modeling dependencies between groups of variables rather than between individual variables. Motivated by this, we study prospects of representing relationships between variable groups using Bayesian network structures. We show that for dependency structures between groups to be expressible exactly, the data have to satisfy the so-called groupwise faithfulness assumption. We also show that one cannot learn causal relations between groups using only groupwise conditional independencies, but also variable-wise relations are needed. Additionally, we present algorithms for finding the groupwise dependency structures.","['Pekka Parviainen', 'Samuel Kaski']",f0c91552-bc84-401f-9dcf-94f67699eaac,0,"['0b3ed18c-50ac-4907-b6c2-855302e5c529', '31e9ae1e-b720-43b5-ba66-80e9760bcd8a', '58047a6e-ba25-4e8d-b713-9c401387853a', '5da0d888-a04d-4a56-8a87-2210b82805ec', '6593b662-df37-4795-b578-6876f0e45cfb', '6d676520-bf7f-454a-920d-743be22ff59b', '72437a62-d49e-4c11-adc9-3bb27a3e00cd', '7d27e111-6484-45d3-83ab-fe71e453b5cb', '7e89f44f-a211-44e2-89fa-8fdeb5a361d6', '952af55b-76d5-4bb4-97b1-58116e9d5bcb', '9dbfe116-0b5d-400b-8758-5fc5ebc62320', 'afd2ef8f-3966-4519-9306-ee504b14847a', 'b00445b2-74f9-49de-a228-16ed2a4eb9b7', 'c9f070c0-7896-4c2c-8552-5e8be792d0ad', 'e412529d-0700-41ea-92c3-52fba72bcb17', 'f8b2045f-195e-420f-9516-df72eeb7df74', 'ffe5621a-4cc5-47ac-b68b-1e089302d278']",Learning Structures of Bayesian Networks for Variable Groups,International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,2017
1533,"Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) may be successfully treated pharmacologically and surgically to preserve and even improve their life quality and health conditions. Although the progress of the disease cannot be stopped, at least mitigation of the most handicapping symptoms can be achieved. But both pharmacological and surgical treatments require the adequate monitoring of the disease stage of progress and the effects of treatment. Several techniques have been proposed for PD evolution monitoring, ranging from subjective auto-evaluation by questionnaires, or from gait and handwriting examination by specialists. Nevertheless, these techniques present certain difficulties, which make frequent evaluation impractical. On the other hand, it is known that speech acoustic analysis may estimate indicators of patient's conditions, and can be implemented for a frequent evaluation protocol; and under minimal help, it can be carried out at distance using communication technologies. The acoustic analysis, may be based on mel-cepstral coefficients, distortion features as  jitter, shimmer , harmonic-to-noise contents, or pitch-perturbation estimates, among others. Phonation biomechanical parameter and tremor estimates are also good markers of PD. The present work proposes a combination of biomechanical features to predict PD progress using Bayesian likelihood estimation. This methodology proves to be very sensitive and allows a three-band based comparison: pre-treatment versus post-treatment in reference to a control subject or a normative population. Results from a study are presented, including eight patients recorded on a 4-week separation interval, meanwhile they were treated with medication, physical exercising and speech therapy. The conclusions show that certain distortion, biomechanical and tremor features are of special relevance to monitor PD phonation, and that they can be used as evolution markers.","['Pedro Gómez-Vilda', 'D.

1534,"In this letter, a novel anomaly detection framework with transferred deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. The framework is designed by considering the following facts: 1) a reference data with labeled samples are utilized, because no prior information is available about the image scene for anomaly detection and 2) pixel pairs are generated to enlarge the sample size, since the advantage of CNN can be realized only if the number of training samples is sufficient. A multilayer CNN is trained by using difference between pixel pairs generated from the reference image scene. Then, for each pixel in the image for anomaly detection, difference between pixel pairs, constructed by combining the center pixel and its surrounding pixels, is classified by the trained CNN with the result of similarity measurement. The detection output is simply generated by averaging these similarity scores. Experimental performance demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the classic Reed-Xiaoli and the state-of-the-art representation-based detectors, such as sparse representation-based detector (SRD) and collaborative representation-based detector.","['Wei Li', 'Guodong Wu', 'Qian Du']",b544b617-1cab-4812-978f-db05088992f4,0,"['1c3e336c-a4e4-4fea-be91-04effd9d7806', '29f662dc-3c0a-473f-a21d-a5f753e264e4', '4f76ab2f-75ab-4b68-a0d8-684252893206', '52b7c594-8f6a-40a5-9366-f50c209965d3', '72e7d4a8-f1d3-432a-9028-6845a12738cd', '8e86af93-a1fd-47b4-bfe3-f4e7cd78d80e', '8ebc7bc7-f36d-4957-b146-d4c6d0c83cc6', '955ab573-2d2e-40ce-b553-06783de77a2b', '9cbbb590-5d64-4afd-99e5-9ca6e3bc6a61', '9e96fa44-2ecb-4e1d-9027-7d27cff00f64', 'a388d5dd-ac66-41b3-a4f1-02089cc1b793', 'a840e1a0-f049-4119-88cc-e6f26b25c842', 'b55ff3e5-4a6f-411b-8176-e8030f8ca3ed', 'c6eebb73-d48b-42ab-a8d2-bb511aef275b', 'fc3b6043-ec7d-4eaf-827b-bbcb2a04a124']",Transferred Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
1535,"Healthcare payers are exploring cost-containing policies to steer patients, through qualified information and financial incentives, towards providers offering the best value. With Reference Pricing (RP), a payer determines a maximum amount paid for a procedure, and patients selecting a provider charging more pay the difference. In a Tiered Network (TN), providers are stratified according to criteria such as quality and cost, each tier having a different out-of-pocket price. Motivated by a program recently implemented in California, we design an optimization model for payers combining both RP and TN, filling the gap of quantitative research on these novel payment policies. The main decision is to select which providers to exempt from RP, whose patients will face no out-of-pocket costs. Patients’ choice of a provider is modeled with a Multinomial Logit model. The objective is to minimize the payer’s cost, while constraints provide decision makers with levers for a trade-off between cost reduction and providers quality. We build a robust counterpart of our model to account for parameter uncertainty. Numerical experiments provide insights into how tiers are scattered on a price/quality plane. We argue that this system has strong potential in terms of costs reduction, quality increase for patients and visibility for high-value providers.","['Victoire Denoyel', 'Laurent Alfandari', 'Aurélie Thiele']",6fc260ee-507a-4dd9-890d-00fbee4e913a,0,"['33ecf14d-7b4c-42a7-a981-c602522c264f', '3d9ef755-d0b7-41c0-931f-96e1330bfc6d', '4cb6be25-d292-4026-8070-a6a1769666b2', '4cb73b73-17bb-45fa-8b94-90cf9d50b5f9', '4d311c1b-4544-43c8-97a0-f336d175e204', '529223f0-ca13-4559-964d-2f4acfece380', '7b21a6aa-1faa-474f-9b59-3d8a26d29c1e', '95e074e4-45e4-4f63-81bc-fd69bd5c4e05', 'c843984b-0fc4-46dd-a778-f651a8f66adf', 'f04cd250-f78d-46c5-9808-d32041024c21']",Optimizing Healthcare Network Design under Reference Pricing and Parameter Uncertainty,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
1536,"A new family of one-factor distributions for modeling high-dimensional binary data is introduced. The model provides an explicit probability for each event, thus avoiding the numeric approximations often made by existing methods. Model interpretation is easy, because each variable is described by two continuous parameters (corresponding to the marginal probability and to the strength of dependency with the other variables) and by one binary parameter (defining if the dependencies are positive or negative). This model is extended by splitting the variables into independent blocks, where each block follows the new one-factor distribution. Finally, a parsimonious version of the model, forcing some equality constraints between the dependency parameters, is proposed. Parameter estimation is carried out by an inference margin procedure, where the second step is achieved by an expectation-maximization algorithm. Model selection is performed by a deterministic approach, which strongly reduces the number of competing models. This consistent approach uses a hierarchical ascendant classification of the variables which selects a narrow subset of models. This selection is based on the empirical version of Cramer’s V. The new model is evaluated on numerical experiments and on a real data set. The procedure is implemented in the R package MvBinary.","['Matthieu Marbac', 'Mohammed Sedki']",3901ee91-a18b-4f7a-a9ef-ed698b5d5d6e,0,"['07992d3b-c3fc-4a2a-866c-546fd3d1fd4a', '0d86dd10-edf2-4a99-aa03-eb36fd147d8c', '56c0599e-570b-4710-8926-5833921156ce', '590941d1-3c76-4314-924c-5bbbe3a33bb6', 'afc0f8c3-3c3d-4303-9f6f-8a2d30d221d2', 'e9ca9330-20cb-4835-8692-0042299d9340']",A family of block-wise one-factor distributions for modeling high-dimensional binary data,Computational Statistics & Data Analysis,2017
1537,"With the rapid development of computer and the Internet techniques, the amount of data in all walks of life increases sharply, especially accumulating numerous high-dimensional big data such as the network transactions data, the user reviews data and the multimedia data. High-dimensional big data mixes the typical features of both high-dimensional data and big data, which has also brought new problems and great challenges for processing and optimizing the high-dimensional big data. In this case, the storage structure of high-dimensional big data is a critical factor that can affect the processing performance in a fundamental way. However, due to the huge dimensionality feature of high-dimensional data, the existing data storage techniques, such as row-store and column-store, are not very suitable for high-dimensional and large scale data.

However, real-time grasp planning for complex robotic hands is a challenging task. In this paper, we present real-time grasping planning algorithms that utilize two simple yet effective dimension reduction strategies. The first strategy is the “intersected volume” computation which places the robotic palm relative to the object as well as its environment. The second strategy is the “finger curling planes” which decomposes a grasp contact computation problem in high-dimensional configuration space into several independent grasp contact computation problems in low-dimensional configuration space.

1540,"Dynamic ensemble selection (DES) techniques work by estimating the competence level of each classifier from a pool of classifiers, and selecting only the most competent ones for the classification of a specific test sample. The key issue in DES is defining a suitable criterion for calculating the classifiers’ competence. There are several criteria available to measure the level of competence of base classifiers, such as local accuracy estimates and ranking. However, using only one criterion may lead to a poor estimation of the classifier’s competence. In order to deal with this issue, we have proposed a novel dynamic ensemble selection framework using meta-learning, called META-DES. A meta-classifier is trained, based on the meta-features extracted from the training data, to estimate the level of competence of a classifier for the classification of a given query sample. An important aspect of the META-DES framework is that multiple criteria can be embedded in the system encoded as different sets of meta-features. However, some DES criteria are not suitable for every classification problem. For instance, local accuracy estimates may produce poor results when there is a high degree of overlap between the classes. Moreover, a higher classification accuracy can be obtained if the performance of the meta-classifier is optimized for the corresponding data. In this paper, we propose a novel version of the META-DES framework based on the formal definition of the Oracle, called META-DES.Oracle. The Oracle is an abstract method that represents an ideal classifier selection scheme. A meta-feature selection scheme using an overfitting cautious Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) is proposed for improving the performance of the meta-classifier. The difference between the outputs obtained by the meta-classifier and those presented by the Oracle is minimized. Thus, the meta-classifier is expected to obtain results that are similar to the Oracle. Experiments carried out using 30 classification problems demonstrate that the optimization procedure based on the Oracle definition leads to a significant improvement in classification accuracy when compared to previous versions of the META-DES framework and other state-of-the-art DES techniques.","['Rafael M.

1541,"In the context of security analysis for information flow properties, where a potentially malicious observer (intruder) tracks the observed behavior of a given system, infinite-step opacity (respectively,   K     K       -step opacity) holds if the intruder can never determine for sure that the system was in a secret state for any instant within infinite steps (respectively,   K     K        steps) prior to that particular instant. We present new algorithms for the verification of the properties of infinite-step opacity and   K     K       -step opacity for partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as finite-state automata. Our new algorithms are based on a novel separation principle for state estimates that characterizes the information dependence in opacity verification problems, and they have lower computational complexity than previously-proposed ones in the literature. Specifically, we propose a new information structure, called the  two-way observer   , that is used for the verification of infinite-step and   K     K       -step opacity. Based on the two-way observer, a new upper bound for the delay in   K     K       -step opacity is derived, which also improves previously-known results.","['Xiang Yin', 'Stéphane Lafortune']",fdad5596-f93e-4d22-844a-425f7a2f319f,0,"['18a85f73-4947-44b4-bd02-00bab1ef38fc', '1bc2fc0d-f992-4f22-a97d-04fa5476f010', '33c3ade6-35ec-4854-aa7e-8fc307008a49', '381591eb-162a-435e-8bfb-394d69137677', '38ff7329-2c65-45a5-a875-98a5d55d5d5d', '39c5ee38-769a-406b-aa65-e4d33d362587', '49f5dadc-9971-4fc9-bb3f-9d50e080cec2', '4f48650e-be32-4a75-8a82-f4f93deb0235', '8f58769f-92f3-4bba-8090-d7c968d5111e', '9572a9e5-4986-4c23-b05c-56531eb7cf26', '9c0f6e1e-b1c5-46ee-8f0e-16242fe0fa0f', '9c1d981f-fbb2-4c9f-9397-f91d16ee50ee', 'abf99ff9-0e48-4edf-9cf3-0637f689d8de', 'af4b85f4-e8b2-4d55-a741-2a23cd9ea54c', 'b4ca9e3f-d878-430d-a354-aa1731291b73', 'b519fdf6-312d-4ac5-b732-921424ad89f4', 'b6d592a4-f3c6-4c22-921b-9737a0a48d91', 'be227ea3-2c7e-4f7e-9f79-3e8b6a687b13', 'c4817068-40d7-44c9-bf2d-93b80c35df5e', 'dd9e6dd7-d09f-4397-b5ef-e4fb2569fba1', 'e56d6030-6f62-42f4-bacf-18f33c43a598', 'ed4e9837-b0d6-4735-9c9f-4da7eb113d3f', 'ed93828f-d8b8-4ca9-988c-ac81a15d3502', 'f6fa37f9-f6d1-43b3-9994-c0f9b50ce63a']",A new approach for the verification of infinite-step and K-step opacity using two-way observers,Automatica,2017
1542,"The selection window of selection algorithm used in traditional automatic focus window concentrates mainly on the center of image, so the randomly distributed cells would always be out of focus. To address this problem, on the basis of analyzing the performance of selection algorithm of different focusing windows, a modified auto-focus window algorithm upon traditional fish swarm algorithm has been proposed: fish swarm window selection algorithm. After comparatively analyzing the images in focus window that are obtained by traditional and improved fish swarm algorithm, a conclude can be drawn that the focus window of modified algorithm can contain more cells and target bodies. To be specific, owing to fish-swarm window selection algorithm, in the selection window the quantity of the high frequency of images greatly increases, the optimal solution converges to 0.999, and the estimated value of sharpness of the obtained microscopic cell images also improves with high precision and high accuracy of focus of the improved algorithm.","['Fengshou Zhang', 'Siwen Li', 'Zhigang Hu', 'Zhe Du']",06d082da-03fd-4d91-9979-73906f7007a4,0,"['151a19c9-ab43-48ba-8fdf-d87aa98c1365', '6e5ea7c3-ad9d-4e25-8071-f58bae7405fc', 'b3f680e3-ab94-4c40-b38e-b5f5044b6a4d', 'e8b437e1-6ef6-4c92-8a7a-15170a012685']",Fish swarm window selection algorithm based on cell microscopic automatic focus,Cluster Computing,2017
1543,"This paper presents a novel control circuit that eliminates signal overshoot inherent to digital step attenuators (DSA) during state transitions. With the addition of digital delay elements, transitions from attenuation state to insertion loss state is delayed with respect to the transition from the insertion loss state to the attenuation state. This prevents unintended signal leakage to the output, eliminating possible signal overshoot. Since this novel technique achieves signal overshoot suppression with a simple addition to the digital control circuit, it is area efficient, and can be applied to any digital attenuator without degrading its RF performance. To present its effectiveness, the proposed technique is employed in a 6-bit DSA. The resulting reduced-overshoot DSA is manufactured in a commercial 0.18 µm Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) process. Measurement results show that this technique successfully suppresses the signal overshoot to less than 0.2 dB.",['Fatih Kocer'],b0e6bf48-1391-422f-ae23-5944a0191464,0,[],A signal overshoot suppression circuit for digital step attenuators,Microelectronics Journal,2017

1545,"Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) has continuously proven effective for multi-objective optimization. So far, the effect of weight vectors and scalarizing methods in MOEA/D has been intensively studied. However, the reference point which serves as the starting point of reference lines (determined by weight vectors) is yet to be well studied. This study aims to fill in this research gap. Ideally, the  ideal  point of a multi-objective problem could serve as the reference point, however, since the  ideal  point is often unknown beforehand, the reference point has to be estimated (or specified). In this study, the effect of the reference point specified in three representative manners, i.e., pessimistic, optimistic and dynamic (from optimistic to pessimistic), is examined on three sets of benchmark problems. Each set of the problems has different degrees of difficulty in convergence and spread. Experimental results show that (i) the reference point implicitly impacts the convergence and spread performance of MOEA/D; (ii) the pessimistic specification emphasizes more of exploiting existing regions and the optimistic specification emphasizes more of exploring new regions; (iii) the dynamic specification can strike a good balance between exploitation and exploration, exhibiting good performance for most of the test problems, and thus, is commended to use for new problems.","['Rui Wang', 'Jian Xiong', 'Hisao Ishibuchi', 'Guohua Wu', 'Tao Zhang']",797899a0-2cd9-44e9-a0f2-267f0064935a,50,"['092fe763-1d40-4fb9-bab8-07d964e797c7', '0cc8a4bb-8bb1-4526-ab1e-ae8ff4eccc6d', '0f7a7cc4-6789-4c84-a8f0-d5e00f2f39ed', '117cf926-944b-497f-8dcf-05485d6b7a75', '177be610-7b6a-49dc-b0bf-88d6990835c1', '1f5b4b74-9c6f-43c8-b490-447ae33d6157', '23dc6e53-9579-4198-bb00-dedfd3e6071b', '28767fe0-38b7-480e-b74b-1cf10682a4b8', '33815adb-d142-4201-8ee0-7a0ee39f4329', '341b1440-7f20-48f6-ade2-befa2ae1f5cd', '3ceb860d-d7b3-44f8-985b-837ac3000e5e', '6472707c-676a-4078-8292-6cba05ee4b68', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '6a39d964-73c0-4458-8262-3f60ee1a06aa', '6a4e1048-4969-40c4-9909-3a1d17c1ef98', '6a5b18f9-61fa-4e8c-8b1d-28ea4458d29c', '72545d7f-fb07-4eb5-902d-bff4a0e42980', '74a75746-6201-418f-adb8-209803f2e655', '7547bdf7-f19e-415d-af43-0fdb6d7c1c44', '7f79c785-d89d-41e8-b7d5-c71248a34603', '867c9845-475e-4093-8f9f-d6e7a57ab70a', '8a7eff37-35ab-4a44-967c-abce7e6e832b', '8adac520-8fd7-41e0-9806-40fe9c7fb0d3', '9786a3f5-f882-4511-9e84-7a70eb075e5e', '97cb83ee-78a0-41e8-bf56-6899af98fbe6', '9cf177c9-48f2-4743-823d-950b096f0008', '9e149784-9b00-44db-bb4d-127cc0e425cb', '9ed7f67d-071f-4468-a376-e96ff52c71dd', '9f7f87c1-326d-42ea-9cc3-77ceae210259', '9f8942c4-d439-4903-be2f-44722010796f', 'a1511ee3-c1b8-44a6-b483-e4f264310564', 'a4552778-773c-4894-abbe-b185adf1f943', 'a764f8e5-e8f8-4756-bd81-7d2c5dc0d31f', 'b0f785ad-91e0-4377-8b2b-812eeb6b687f', 'b5bdaccd-d49b-4be6-82d3-c1cfce8b8d2b', 'bb4023bd-7807-470a-bc74-0138d4b208bf', 'becc81b2-f66d-4db8-afc1-12029413c1c7', 'c90281f1-2b7c-4cc5-b1df-faaa5faec376', 'c95bb807-61ee-4ba6-8835-b6820aa676ac', 'c9a7280d-a2c6-48c4-8a3a-0d1ef5b3679d', 'd4b4c7be-2e71-40d6-a421-d74b80bdf4c2', 'da763e77-162f-4d3f-a172-10ec6f7bb599', 'dd0d3259-bad8-4914-9f12-0a70eb9aed1a', 'e78d0f4a-7948-49dd-86f3-33bd07bc0614', 'eac6f3cc-5f18-4dcd-9ccf-cb7a0b85fa1f']",On the effect of reference point in MOEA/D for multi-objective optimization,Applied Soft Computing,2017
1546,"Symmetry is a useful concept in physics and chemistry. It can be used to find out some simple properties of a molecule or simplify complex calculations. In this paper a simple vector algebraic method is described to determine all symmetry elements of an arbitrary molecule. To carry out the symmetry analysis, a program has been written, which is also capable of generating the framework group of the molecule, revealing the symmetry properties of normal modes of vibration and symmetrizing the structure. To demonstrate the capabilities of the program, it is compared to other common widely used stand-alone symmetry analyzer (SYMMOL, Symmetrizer) and molecular modeling (NWChem, ORCA, MRCC) software. SYVA can generate input files for molecular modeling programs, e.g. Gaussian, using precisely symmetrized molecular structures.

1547,"When contributing to groups on social networking sites (SNS), not all group members necessarily adhere to the group’s norms (i.e., its explicit or implicit rules); in other words, they show norm-deviant behavior. Despite the popularity of groups on SNS and the frequency of norm-deviant behavior within them, research has to date rarely investigated how members of online groups react to those behaviors. This article introduces a model based on the social identity approach regarding the responses to norm-deviations in Facebook groups and reports an experiment testing this model. In this experiment, deviant members were perceived as questioning what the group stands for (i.e., as subverting the group’s identity). Perceptions of identity subversion, in turn, motivated group members to derogate and exclude the deviate. Furthermore, participants were found to ignore the deviate’s contributions (i.e., not to recall them after reading the group’s timeline). Taken together, the results suggest that group members perceive a deviate’s behavior as questioning their group’s image. This, however, does not seem to lead to a group’s decay, but rather promotes a “natural purification” within the group through elimination of negative influences.","['Lara Ditrich', 'Kai Sassenberg']",b6e809f4-8cd7-45ea-a491-601359188127,0,"['1315f07d-d0b6-41ac-b106-5eef37165ae6', '2c4c42fc-a7cb-44ca-837f-caa93540e44b', '8d77ac95-5c5e-4e46-a7ea-88461d06c2a8', '90c768e9-2bd3-44d1-90c8-df6001116bd8', '9509afe6-6ad0-402a-a9f5-2cdeb65f3dda', '9863230f-23ac-4b2a-9c28-27c1e97b5140', 'ce69c9e1-f455-4623-b76e-cf93452e3d46', 'f172bcd3-1990-48f6-8252-bbc30213b1cb', 'f7fb89fc-d03d-49fd-a7a3-c3b7e0f440c4']",Kicking out the trolls – Antecedents of social exclusion intentions in Facebook groups,Computers in Human Behavior,2017

1549,"A novel discriminative graph-based fusion (DGF) method is proposed for urban area classification to fuse heterogeneous features from two data sources, i.e., hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) data. The features include spectral characteristics in HSI, height in LiDAR data, and geometry in image processing technologies like morphological profiles (MPs). Our proposed DGF method couples dimension reduction and heterogeneous feature fusion. The core idea of the proposed method is to search for a projection matrix by minimizing the similarity term that preserves the local geometry of each class and maximizing the dissimilarity term that contains the relation of between-class distance. As a result, the proposed method can pull close together samples of the same class while pushing those of different classes apart in the projected space by fusing graphs constructed by different groups of heterogeneous features. The edges of the graphs are measured by kernel. Furthermore, the multiscale DGF (MS-DGF) is introduced to utilize the capability of similarity measure of different scales of kernel and avoid finding the optimal scale simultaneously. Experiments are conducted on real HSI along with LiDAR data. The corresponding results demonstrate that the proposed method can make an effective fusion of heterogeneous features to make full use of the complementary information of HSI and LiDAR, which facilitates fine classification task of urban area, compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms.","['Yanfeng Gu', 'Qingwang Wang']",a99efd15-3daa-4d71-b909-9dde2bc95f8f,0,"['164ab5ba-ba3c-451f-9ae6-8796d36b0e0e', '174cfb62-53dd-4dce-96fe-3ca1b8c53d88', '1912d0e4-ba37-4e74-893f-5c1f88f37b8e', '9668f123-8b76-4379-bf4c-7e312840f426', '96e0f4fe-e231-43d3-afef-e7487f51c462', '9c3a4a07-0301-4e56-9004-ddc5f8b10d52', 'b0bf035d-499e-47fc-84df-05b60078f0e8', 'bd1099b0-4002-42c9-b592-eb5da3a3e375', 'be156054-2e06-4b02-a578-018dcbad9f73', 'c10c3ce3-fb60-4a7c-895b-632de8ee5552', 'ccd572cc-3269-456d-bdcd-727bce3bfdc7', 'd3d80082-b9db-41af-ad3f-6ca2179a7424', 'dd32cfc1-d8a9-4702-bdba-a2a9ca6075bd', 'dee05ca6-0f60-49f9-afe7-94f83e2ebca1', 'e56450ab-974b-450a-976c-c2548a1d6537', 'e9df670e-be19-4ced-98c1-3c6777203373', 'ea44f0eb-f48b-4220-8a76-12f4f7ff9142', 'eb44aa0b-df65-427c-912f-5af23d0ae006', 'f0f68bf3-b0a7-4470-a836-e7fbf415a50e']",Discriminative Graph-Based Fusion of HSI and LiDAR Data for Urban Area Classification,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
1550,"We propose a principled approach for the problem of aligning multiple partially overlapping networks. The objective is to map multiple graphs into a single graph while preserving vertex and edge similarities. The problem is inspired by the task of integrating partial views of a family tree (genealogical network) into one unified network, but it also has applications, for example, in social and biological networks. Our approach, called Flan, introduces the idea of generalizing the facility location problem by adding a non-linear term to capture edge similarities and to infer the underlying entity network. The problem is solved using an alternating optimization procedure with a Lagrangian relaxation. Flan has the advantage of being able to leverage prior information on the number of entities, so that when this information is available, Flan is shown to work robustly without the need to use any ground truth data for fine-tuning method parameters. Additionally, we present three multiple-network extensions to an existing state-of-the-art pairwise alignment method called Natalie. Extensive experiments on synthetic, as well as real-world datasets on social networks and genealogical networks, attest to the effectiveness of the proposed approaches which clearly outperform a popular multiple network alignment method called IsoRankN.","['Eric Malmi', 'Sanjay Chawla', 'Aristides Gionis']",85143e00-2900-46a7-af22-bcf9c95177ef,0,"['12f07254-13df-4149-9df4-dc837d4cbd66', '1e0528e6-f084-4a2d-ac19-534425f5d3f5', '27823359-aebc-435b-84ae-ff4fe7a05bd0', '29c4f930-b045-4498-87f4-de83df299d5f', '2ccb75da-4b09-4566-b0f0-5ac7e26774ea', '2dbd1339-2b25-492f-b7ea-091b8a1d9bbb', '3506a67f-0cae-4258-920b-2aadc2d40ca9', '515f6bad-6ef3-4fd9-a243-a35505002e17', '694b960d-d57f-4c94-8a56-192e6433f128', '772c1270-54d6-473d-93f6-1829320e7a8e', '7ae6a4e8-4466-4b50-8ed9-86cb265e034a', '868b4cf7-13c1-47da-906e-c982f3b6487b', '9216c2d6-bd10-4a9e-ae6e-0b35d1053222', '9dc7912e-1aa1-4141-a413-b019c5e928be', '9f426e20-8b8d-4bca-8a74-92cbbbaf8376', 'a0fc645f-4671-4d9f-91b0-68b159ae9d7f', 'b93e4279-1db9-491e-834a-8e26551b4ae0', 'c2b0835c-1849-408e-a9c3-e082ed799e33', 'c2f461b1-109c-47eb-8154-60ce6ce4980c', 'f61b3f15-9582-4521-b077-2debb9cc98bb', 'fd3cbd97-99bc-4ec7-b64b-aed7d8818107']",Lagrangian relaxations for multiple network alignment,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,2017

1552,"Interdisciplinary relationships between Geography and Psychotherapy are an opportunity for innovation. Indeed, scientific works found on bibliographic databases and concerning this theme are scarce. Geographical sub-fields, such as the Geography of Emotions or Psychoanalytical Geography have started to emerge, theorizing about and interpreting feelings, emotions, moods, sufferings, of the chronically ill or diversified social groups and sites. But a less theoretical and more practical approach, in the sense of proposing, predicting and intervening, is lacking; as well as research into the possibilities offered by communication technologies and mobile phones. In the present work, we present the results of a review of the most relevant scientific works published internationally; we reflect on the contributions of Geography and mobile phones to psychosocial therapies and define the orientation and questions that should be posed in future research, from the point of view of geography and regarding psychotherapy. We conclude that the production of georeferenced data via mobile phones concerning the daily lives of people opens great possibilities for cognitive behavioural therapy and mental health. They allow for the development of personalized mood maps that locate the places where a person experiences greater or lesser stress on a daily basis; they allow for a cartography of emotions, a cognitive cartography of the places we access physically or through the Internet, of our feelings and psychosocial experiences. They open the door to the possibility of offering personalized psychotherapy treatments focusing on the ecological-environmental analysis of the places frequented by the person on a daily basis.","['Carlos Ferrás', 'Yolanda Iris Disla García', 'Adrian Aguilera', 'Álvaro Rocha']",82f56e74-6c6b-4d29-86fb-5036d5f580e6,0,['c46206b9-c441-4636-ae2c-193897946154'],How Can Geography and Mobile Phones Contribute to Psychotherapy,Journal of Medical Systems,2017

1556,"The purpose of the work described herein is to design highly efficient photosensitizers (PS) for photodynamic therapy (PDT) in theory. A series of expanded Zn porphyrins have been studied as light-activated PS. Their main photophysical properties are systematically calculated by using density functional theory and its time-dependent extension. The mechanisms of PDT are discussed. All the considered candidates exhibit intense absorption in the therapeutic window (600–800 nm), efficient intersystem crossing, and sufficient energy for singlet molecular oxygen production. Accordingly, the designed Zn pentaphyrins and sapphyrins would be proposed as potential PS for PDT. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of Zn pentaphyrins and sapphyrins are better than those of the referenced Zn iso-pentaphyrin. It is expected that the results could provide a new way to design and develop PS for PDT application.","['Xin Wang', 'Fu-Quan Bai', 'Ying-Tao Liu', 'Yu Wang', 'Hong-Xing Zhang', 'Zhenyang Lin']",de528590-b9ec-4b74-b9fe-05b9c5d0000f,0,"['35fa5bcb-e08f-4bff-8392-ee89d6883718', '455bfaa7-6d27-4e38-9b19-792c876b4ea2', '59619555-353f-4316-934a-beffa1203c07', 'b6bcf728-c2ae-44a6-9c57-79f761ea03d6']",A Computational Way To Achieve More Effective Candidates for Photodynamic Therapy,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,2017
1557,"Abrupt motions commonly cause conventional tracking methods to fail because they violate the motion smoothness constraint. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel SIFT flow tracker (SFT) and integrate it into a sparse representation-based tracking framework. In this method, we first introduce the SIFT flow method to address the tracking problem. The method can avoid the local-trap modes and cope with abrupt motion without any prior knowledge. Then, for obtaining the effective samples, we design a new hybrid sampling mechanism, which can sample the local and global predicted location according to confidence map. Finally, to adapt the target appearance variations, especially to partial occlusion, we embed SFT to L1 tracker and construct a unified framework to track both smooth and abrupt motion in time. Compared with several state-of-art tracking algorithms, experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves favorable performance in handling abrupt motion, even under target appearance variations including illumination changes, partial occlusion and pose changes.","['Huanlong Zhang', 'Yanfeng Wang', 'Lingkun Luo', 'Xiankai Lu', 'Miaohui Zhang']",f9edc248-79cc-471a-811f-d4b0e14be052,0,"['050c56f0-4365-475b-863b-2f2338b1c7a8', '0ae61c32-f756-46b3-8932-b40313e48939', '17a589a6-c71d-4c8b-af69-f5c68784c238', '2e99ea9f-74f5-4062-b11a-af109fe9a8f7', '3247158b-f949-4da4-b52c-53583ee8a347', '3c064b44-6fe1-49d0-a0d2-89c7ee180da2', '5552d6e2-7216-442d-b6c8-f1406b9c6713', '58ab7a68-7e48-4ac7-8296-a644b5b2f933', '5f838641-f367-4b45-b577-8a533a0e5405', '65e7fc6f-b3c5-4399-a08b-dea4117c5d4c', '6b5a8073-3e19-4651-9ede-f73f86a5438d', '6bcba636-4c71-4a8b-840a-ce9a5905cb20', '7689b706-c426-4ae7-a14f-cf73bae72603', '7b1d7666-6312-49f1-8297-d44af4e3cef1', '83c737b8-e084-4766-ba6e-131e6a1c017c', '8532451f-46ac-443d-8157-ae53a4c88a0d', '8fde5313-15de-4ac7-8439-91150b4330e3', '910a223b-1f53-4100-a600-6cce47c85f1d', '935e93a5-fb44-4542-b7ba-b9e9d6cd295b', '9a281963-feb8-44a4-94e7-a378e29f6632', 'a4c45847-d621-46b0-8c08-534e468721f7', 'b3f342d0-a82c-45d6-b9f8-33b6a7cb88fa', 'b8bcdab9-753d-40a5-93aa-864d43d28ec5', 'bbe9d7f7-6a0f-4a40-a5db-cfe90b5124ee', 'bc9d9aee-be96-44a1-b36e-4c4421f06d9d', 'bd65a046-d3af-4efc-be44-ea060923a86e', 'd35531f1-ddde-4b9f-ad5c-9af2613433a9', 'dee52dac-0991-40b3-89b5-d4269b993980', 'e9bb42e0-73c6-47d3-99a7-6a88c5d188f0', 'eacc9572-d663-457e-ae19-b32fc324fbb4', 'f51869d5-2777-4539-863b-6828684cf5b5']",SIFT flow for abrupt motion tracking via adaptive samples selection with sparse representation,Neurocomputing,2017
1558,"Target detection has occupied a pivotal position in distributed system. Scan statistics, as one of the most efficient detection methods, has been applied to a variety of anomaly detection problems and significantly improves the probability of detection. However, scan statistics cannot achieve the expected performance when the noise intensity is strong, or the signal emitted by the target is weak. The local vote algorithm can also achieve higher target detection rate. After the local vote, the counting rule is always adopted for decision fusion. The counting rule does not use the information about the contiguity of sensors but takes all sensors’ data into consideration, which makes the result undesirable. In this paper, we propose a scan statistics with local vote (SSLV) method. This method combines scan statistics with local vote decision. Before scan statistics, each sensor executes local vote decision according to the data of its neighbors and its own. By combining the advantages of both, our method can obtain higher detection rate in low signal-to-noise ratio environment than the scan statistics. After the local vote decision, the distribution of sensors which have detected the target becomes more intensive. To make full use of local vote decision, we introduce a variable-step-parameter for the SSLV. It significantly shortens the scan period especially when the target is absent. Analysis and simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of our method.","['Junhai Luo', 'Qi Wu']",7845acb2-766c-40e5-9144-556d2a93c2cc,0,"['336c61dc-586b-47b4-891d-441b4a1ac71c', '615edb9b-fb52-4093-be34-4bf9d0480444', '6bbce7f1-1305-4255-b3ff-a3a9b086ea61', '70e1f30d-a8b9-40e1-8023-53cfef2bd161', '78ccfa07-ea40-4b25-8343-2be1c72aa4da', 'a4b12597-140c-4d79-96ee-5dc94e880d71', 'e8840fa2-d9f8-4afd-87c1-af86227cfbda', 'f34e2678-1953-44a8-961b-4c38a58d42a8']",Scan statistics with local vote for target detection in distributed system,EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,2017
1559,"This work devises a maximum-margin sparse coding algorithm, jointly considering reconstruction loss and hinge loss in the model. The sparse representation along with maximum-margin constraint is analogous to kernel trick and maximum-margin properties of support vector machine (SVM), giving a base for the proposed algorithm to perform well in classification tasks. The key idea behind the proposed method is to use labeled and unlabeled data to learn discriminative representations and model parameters simultaneously, making it easier to classify data in the new space. We propose to use block coordinate descent to learn all the components of the proposed model and give detailed derivation for the update rules of the model variables. Theoretical analysis on the convergence of the proposed MMSC algorithm is provided based on Zangwill’s global convergence theorem. Additionally, most previous research studies on dictionary learning suggest to use an overcomplete dictionary to improve classification performance, but it is computationally intensive when the dimension of the input data is huge. We conduct experiments on several real data sets, including Extended YaleB, AR face, and Caltech101 data sets. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other comparison algorithms without an overcomplete dictionary, providing flexibility to deal with high-dimensional data sets.","['Chien-Liang Liu', 'Wen-Hoar Hsaio', 'Bin Xiao', 'Chun-Yu Chen', 'Wei-Liang Wu']",5c15a31d-cd65-4463-8abb-253955b4e0f4,0,"['0049e75f-b463-46cc-af9f-53826ef46b90', '00e17dcb-6e2a-4a45-b89b-00fa7e1ef77e', '08a4f425-a9ad-4f6d-9dc0-04864515cf30', '090f9668-06d3-44eb-89b5-63a22d4fb7b5', '12b49210-6efe-4f01-ad21-c3e025dfe6bf', '1552565f-cf4d-42ea-a8c2-dd9a3a25b32d', '22e95610-f65d-42e2-a9d9-3b0eeab7a234', '274ba5bd-3c0b-4b23-80f7-a3578034f96f', '380c9c81-58cf-4ca6-ad04-f56e299ca5a3', '3c1f9893-1a32-4afb-9f40-5d4856b7f886', '3f960ccb-9267-419d-b179-13ae9a05d964', '425a9231-03db-48f9-aa15-688987d7ea8d', '5e8b0e8a-d687-4333-bfe9-73b4c1bebde5', '5f8f7c01-a1b8-4f84-b75f-e06768f1ddce', '6ded8970-1ba8-4422-bcab-9e7c291d85f4', '6e4a6bd8-16c8-4523-9f12-d64fd8ff00fe', '7236dbb7-f0b2-4e28-bb7c-6de187c32d64', '7490c152-6ff1-4d69-a39e-81a639e0fd93', '75fee600-0778-4e48-a836-eed11a378965', '7ca35a30-f496-490d-bf55-c3f1abf99178', '7dcfd7cd-68c0-4df3-83f1-0983eeccf91f', '86f63d7c-124d-4d98-9645-54cba1e85bd6', '895a17d7-c502-4fe6-82aa-9515d71d5689', '89f46bf4-3f26-45e2-b1d2-7698ae5b9673', '8ca5fab4-665b-44c3-8fdd-477bf134d67b', '8d28e5c3-29cb-46b7-af5a-ab5bd9fd06ef', '95e314d8-096a-4130-b34e-0454dcdf9147', '99dc6a88-265a-48e9-9a3b-80f19b8c3b97', 'a3518cf2-430f-4f42-8d58-4b172b55d345', 'a6c062f9-94c1-4c99-abff-7265d9fc0508', 'ae91d4b9-5de0-4e90-aad1-9ad99415d40c', 'b4c33364-d849-4e81-8e4d-8033d0619c71', 'b7850d71-2cee-4c3b-9d53-216d63ca0515', 'b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b', 'bd6926cc-6b52-4c2b-bca6-6c4959666419', 'c1255f60-5013-48aa-8b16-d4d2fe913941', 'c9482f1f-6600-44a7-a69a-e63ef13cdff8', 'cf8ede63-496b-4335-a910-e95dbd0aa70b', 'd3bf0f57-99f8-485c-8e4f-b63d86b0ea1e', 'e0933e9c-d7e8-49e6-804e-c0e2d370805b', 'e0ac4812-7729-4a2d-8a1f-74b1b7c8eb5d', 'e592e6c7-d7ca-401f-ade8-ff9a53607eef', 'e984d25c-0f8f-45c7-90c8-1e39ea5ccbbb', 'eed11afc-536b-4a91-a055-d3b89b71a525', 'f2cbd0c1-6d0c-4aec-852c-2bf59642ae40', 'f2ed6d4c-f027-4042-a7eb-eb66c5b31402']",Maximum-margin sparse coding,Neurocomputing,2017
1560,"Color image restoration is an important problem in image processing. Using the structured total least squares (STLS) for fidelity term of the restoration process gives better results in comparison with the least squares (LS) approach. The main drawback of the STLS approach is its complexity. To overcome this issue, in this paper by an appropriate transformation the color image restoration is substituted with two smaller subproblems corresponding to smooth and oscillatory parts of the image. The first and second subproblems are modeled via STLS and LS approaches, respectively. We show that the proposed method is faster than STLS and gives competitive solutions with it. Also, we demonstrate that Haar wavelet perseveres the structure of the blurring operator, which causes a considerable reduction in computational and storage complexity of the proposed method.","['Raheleh Feiz', 'Mansoor Rezghi']",806a38d2-bebb-4a86-b5f9-cc2ee6cf4fab,0,"['0626a974-e6f4-4224-a3a2-22e20040ce75', '0912b874-d87f-41fe-a445-37c57fb1d298', '2aaae7ce-929c-4aba-970f-1cf1150de202', '3060518a-2301-417d-9c36-e68add239d58', '38feae8a-914b-4957-8e21-662a4f156d39', '3dd913b8-e22d-434e-9015-bf68fbbb7bef', '443f5e21-32d4-488f-9203-3e9e40bde6f6', '51149150-1271-49e3-8711-36bb930a124b', '6b67ced9-eb47-4e38-b718-17c26f7d4e66', '7cabf034-8f07-4739-913e-efe51829c10c', '942961b6-acd3-405b-8fb4-f43643ed3788', '9e416d52-6bbc-45a0-a686-0c61ffecce5e', 'a730b7d0-d339-4827-bae2-8ea1a132b671', 'ee941f02-3395-405b-835b-9e382e4c7d80', 'fa343164-45ad-43d5-abcf-ec94eda1400a']",A Splitting Method for Total Least Squares Color Image Restoration Problem,Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation,2017

1562,"The shifting of image mean brightness and the domination of high-frequency bins during histogram equalization (HE) often result in the deteriorating quality of enhanced images and a considerable amount of information loss. This study proposes a novel approach based on bi-histogram equalization to improve its abilities in preserving information entropy and mean brightness. The proposed technique, named Bi-histogram Equalization using Modified Histogram Bins (BHEMHB), segments the input histogram based on the median brightness of an image and alters the histogram bins before HE is applied. Histogram segmentation enables mean brightness preservation, whereas the modification of histogram bins restricts the enhancement rate, thus minimizing the domination effects of high-frequency histogram bins. Simulation results show that BHEMHB significantly outperforms its peers in preserving the details and mean brightness of an image.

1563,"Social networking services have been prevalent at many online communities such as Twitter.com and Weibo.com, where millions of users keep interacting with each other every day. One interesting and important problem in the social networking services is to rank users based on their vitality in a timely fashion. An accurate ranking list of user vitality could benefit many parties in social network services such as the ads providers and site operators. Although it is very promising to obtain a vitality-based ranking list of users, there are many technical challenges due to the large scale and dynamics of social networking data. In this paper, we propose a unique perspective to achieve this goal, which is quantifying user vitality by analyzing the dynamic interactions among users on social networks. Examples of social network include but are not limited to social networks in microblog sites and academical collaboration networks. Intuitively, if a user has many interactions with his friends within a time period and most of his friends do not have many interactions with their friends simultaneously, it is very likely that this user has high vitality. Based on this idea, we develop quantitative measurements for user vitality and propose our first algorithm for ranking users based vitality. Also, we further consider the mutual influence between users while computing the vitality measurements and propose the second ranking algorithm, which computes user vitality in an iterative way. Other than user vitality ranking, we also introduce a vitality prediction problem, which is also of great importance for many applications in social networking services. Along this line, we develop a customized prediction model to solve the vitality prediction problem. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we collect two dynamic social network data sets. The experimental results with both data sets clearly demonstrate the advantage of our ranking and prediction methods.","['Richang Hong', 'Chuan He', 'Yong Ge', 'Meng Wang', 'Xindong Wu']",30a7ca9f-00ac-48f3-9d80-6269c7814000,0,"['07f2d996-17b3-47c8-8833-4ea888d6a0e7', '265c67e5-bb41-4110-a74b-c7d3195c973e', '305d65bc-fc71-47d4-b4e4-c122d44c6d7c', '38d1329b-e9bc-483a-94a8-d5dc1ac9ff33', '3e2f1f5c-f93f-42d0-95ec-5eb1a003ea1a', '4c111a68-ea8a-4cff-a51e-ad312c981563', '7113c82a-1b2d-4582-9cc4-1ba5aef60994', '739661da-f0e5-49a9-afc2-59595f6ed785', '7f573edf-aacb-4e87-9169-d26ab6408bbf', '8cc13968-4e56-47c7-a43b-639eb732291a', '8f9e92cf-f266-4e51-807f-c098a260a0dc', '90c3515b-ec94-43b3-a051-d45da298590c', '9452431c-0092-4833-b8cd-350c5dafc49f', '9863baf6-d69f-495a-8d5a-71442adea84e', 'da630a25-f822-4e83-96ce-c8e7b4fdcc30', 'da773e14-5247-4600-8da8-2452699899d9', 'edc9ac42-597c-425f-aa22-54012cd32d7d', 'f7260813-5d63-421c-bfbf-4569baa104f7', 'fdf2873b-b5cf-4b3e-93d6-5537cdba354f']",User Vitality Ranking and Prediction in Social Networking Services: A Dynamic Network Perspective,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,2017
1564,"A flow table in an OpenFlow based switch is used to not only operate the switch, but also carry out the control function of the Software Defined Network (SDN) controller. However, as a core participant of network management, its limited storage has been a significant roadblock for the industrialization of SDN. It is a significant problem to reduce the number of flow entries needed in the almost full-filled flow tables, and at the same time, to retain the original QoS as much as possible — or known as the  “Flow Table Congestion Problem” (FTCP) . We propose a mechanism called  “Flow Table Reduction Scheme” (FTRS)  to efficiently solve FTCP and evaluate the performance of FTRS both via simulation and experiment. The results show that FTRS is able to reduce the number of flow entries by 98% at most of the size of flow table with no influence on network’s normal functions.","['Bing Leng', 'Liusheng Huang', 'Chunming Qiao', 'Hongli Xu', 'Xinglong Wang']",d593ed1d-861d-40f7-b1d9-0319b9fdc769,0,"['1661a60e-6145-4d4b-8bf8-32cfcea7d7ff', '25a00df6-3011-460b-a108-d7e31ccd5af5', '42998412-ea6d-4c68-8b4b-a511f8d7d249', '480d0735-2aa8-4662-ab3b-9706517d0ea9', '6404a5d5-cac4-48d0-88a3-a02e67ff28d1', '74b3c660-0a37-454b-bab6-0d8ad066a5ea', '7af5d072-1608-45d6-87cb-0070c11e4926', '8cff219f-138d-419d-9abb-7f6f9425896b', '948d73eb-f55f-4219-b378-cea550415323', '963ba378-cd7b-4135-93d7-89ab418310a6', 'abf7f290-5b74-4b9a-9661-a1af46b0083a', 'ba65da46-5421-4f2e-8872-1ecc92dd8c9a', 'bf9bb61d-c363-4216-ad8f-8d530788aa72', 'c11379d6-0520-4049-a12f-f2d330571ba9', 'd6ffd0e7-61aa-4dea-9fe0-4345e2382e96', 'ddcdc8aa-282a-4ad9-b380-5243b9cab164']",FTRS: A mechanism for reducing flow table entries in software defined networks,Computer Networks,2017
1565,"This paper presents the design and data-driven overhead analysis of PrefiSec, a distributed framework that helps collaborating organizations to effectively maintain and share network information in the fight against miscreants. PrefiSec is a novel distributed IP-prefix-based solution, which maintains information about the activities associated with IP prefixes (blocks of IP addresses) and autonomous systems (AS) and enables efficient sharing of this information between participants. Within PrefiSec, we design and evaluate simple and scalable mechanisms that help to protect against prefix/subprefix attacks and interception attacks, and enable sharing of prefix related information related to a wide range of edge-based attacks, such as spamming and scanning. We also include an evaluation of which ASes need to collaborate, to what extent the size and locality of ASes matter, and how many ASes are needed to achieve good efficiency in detecting anomalous route announcements. Public wide-area BGP-announcements, traceroutes, and simulations are used to estimate the overhead, scalability, and alert rates. Our results show that PrefiSec helps improve system security, and can scale to large systems.","['Rahul Hiran', 'Niklas Carlsson', 'Nahid Shahmehri']",8cd7baa5-ed5b-40b0-8df8-42dcf73e5e67,0,"['21f6bf6e-63de-4ace-b599-30f6816d4a54', '2bab04c8-e9b8-4da1-88eb-abd2e99aa4d5', '30153af0-7eae-43e8-9f70-e87913959619', '331609ab-10ba-4d93-b1e8-23405744b39a', '3456195b-30c8-475f-a7a5-5ce4a7b1ca3d', '3b3fa1a6-e33f-4345-98ae-2794994c5a80', '3e1e5706-3f13-4885-94f4-b65853684be7', '422c2308-865e-4f36-8ec0-9a484e1d8623', '4c36f482-1f7d-4a6c-a6f9-2e0a5b7056a4', '4f371409-dff6-4fab-b8eb-7b38984aff21', '53fa965b-0a24-4050-9cf6-36d1cfeb63f3', '58af04d7-3863-40e7-8fa0-b54413bc9574', '5bdf486d-2f53-4d33-a02a-bf8e921695c8', '5d1c1331-1509-416a-81a3-a325998a2fbf', '6129b8e3-c5fe-4ee0-b42b-3542f31d4ded', '6bd7df0b-9f3f-4f7b-829d-37f4c71b37bc', '7b99f97a-df71-4a30-b7a4-1e4a64ac7722', '7e2c4c31-9227-47c0-aec1-99b86292d243', '88683398-3052-45ff-a9cb-8813f8df92be', '892094f6-190a-47a1-8b2d-7bad51fe3afb', '8cbea21f-382a-46c2-9892-bef16d0434e4', '90606d59-edf2-45d3-92dd-d215f1de8b69', '959efb27-3c98-47c4-a06c-784c3cb67286', '9c153d86-3cc8-4e70-9bab-b659d12c2cbe', '9cc6d6bf-5606-44e9-8792-add81042aebd', '9d797635-9cbd-4e28-98b2-f6a37a939b0f', 'a5945816-688b-4848-884e-391f5e8daf38', 'a811b066-87a0-4cff-89c9-0b1f780dc4c1', 'aa344af6-0730-433b-86ee-4f9f7a246b03', 'b946b248-63e4-48cc-b18e-e49efab45a48', 'bafec431-634e-428e-a023-da8b14ee29b7', 'beab2d0f-7b44-484f-859a-f2aaa50c2ccc', 'ddf467f4-2311-4f22-9718-654920eb0676', 'ddf54b7e-b106-4837-9780-9d09f3ea5737', 'dff02519-1d01-4570-bd2c-4bba6234290c', 'e5f2de3d-debc-4ab4-89ea-ac8a719c71e8', 'e5feebef-a3c7-450c-8d37-23fad13e2aff', 'ef6de9d7-d674-4fec-be59-c2e39e8745c9']",Collaborative Framework for Protection Against Attacks Targeting BGP and Edge Networks,Computer Networks,2017

Most of the multi-objective optimization algorithms use different search techniques inspired by different optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms, differential evolutions, particle swarm optimization, cuckoo search etc., but search techniques of recently developed metaheuristics have hardly been investigated. Non-dominated moth-flame optimization algorithm (NS-MFO) is based on the search technique of moth-flame optimization algorithm (MFO) algorithm and utilizes the elitist non-dominated sorting and crowding distance approach for obtaining different non domination levels and to preserve the diversity among the optimal set of solutions respectively. The effectiveness of the method is measured by implementing it on multi-objective benchmark problems and multi-objective engineering design problems with distinctive features. It is shown in this paper that this method effectively generates the Pareto front and also, this method is easy to implement and algorithmically simple.","['Vimal Savsani', 'Mohamed A.

1567,"This study investigated the effects of the BYOD (bring your own device) approach on student language learning. In the research scenario, junior high school students brought their Android-based smart phones to class in order to engage in language evaluation activities, where an application (app) called Socrative was used as a learning assessment tool. A quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test control group design was used to answer the research question. 46 eighth-grade students from two classes at a public junior high school in Taiwan participated in the four-week educational experiment. Student participants received 6 quizzes as a formative evaluation during the experiment. A learning achievement test (summative evaluation) was developed to measure the students' understanding of English vocabulary and grammar. One month after the completion of the summative evaluation, the same achievement test (delayed summative evaluation) with different item numbers was administered to assess the long-term transfer of learning in the students. A self-report questionnaire and an informal interview were used to ascertain the students' learning experiences. The formative evaluation results showed that students in the traditional instruction class outperformed those in the BYOD instruction class because several BYOD students were not familiar with the BYOD approach. Although the BYOD and the traditional instruction approaches yielded similar summative evaluation and delayed summative evaluation results, the BYOD approach demonstrated a valuable benefit on the students' long-term transfer of learning. Students in the BYOD instruction class exhibited a steady growth on learning outcomes and subsequently scored higher on the learning retention segment of the study. In addition, the BYOD teaching practice advanced the students’ second language learning experiences, particularly regarding learning motivation and interest.

1568,"Flow velocity measurement is important in hydrology. Recently, owing to the popularity of sensors and processors, image-based flow velocity measurement methods have become an important research direction. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a key example. However, due to the uncertainty of the features, PIV sometimes provides very inaccurate results and always requires customized setups. In this research, we take advantage of the human perception system, that is, the strong abilities related to feature identification and tracking, in order to estimate the surface flow velocity of a river. We developed a method called crowd-based velocimetry (CBV) to incorporate the human perception capacity in the estimation of the flow velocity. CBV includes three main steps: (1) video processing, (2) crowd processing, and (3) statistical processing. We validated CBV by measuring a fast, steady, and uniform river surface flow in an artificial canal. The results show that compared to radar measurements from the center of the flow, CBV measured the surface flow velocity with a deviation ranging between +12.1% and +17.3% from the radar measurement, while PIV resulted in a −1.7% to −24.3% deviation. With rapidly improving mobile devices, CBV allows enormous numbers of people to engage in flow measurement, making CBV more reliable, more efficient, and more economical.","['Yao-Yu Yang', 'Shih-Chung Kang']",dd931be2-d1c4-4d24-9731-fc5d231ed604,0,"['112fe544-122e-451b-9b87-b9c6243b0a5d', 'a5bf101d-3d92-4263-9658-cc32444dd169']",Crowd-based velocimetry for surface flows,Advanced Engineering Informatics,2017

We discuss three basic issues inherent in using tweets for research evaluation: whose tweets can be used to assess a paper, what objects can be evaluated, and how to score the paper according to each tweet. We suggest that tweets written by those involved in publication of the paper in question should not be included in the paper’s evaluation. Tweets unrelated to the content of the paper should also be excluded. Because controversies in research are inevitable and difficult to resolve, we suggest omitting somewhat supportive and negative tweets in research evaluation. Logically, neutral tweets (such as those linking to, and excerpts from, papers) express a degree of compliment, agreement, interest, or surprise, albeit less so than the tweets explicitly expressing these sentiments. Recommendation tweets also reflect one or more of these sentiments. Expansion tweets, which are inspired by the papers, reflect the function of research. Therefore, we suggest giving a higher weight to praise, agreement, interest, surprise, recommendation and expansion tweets linking to an academic paper than neutral tweets when scoring a paper.

1570,"The single-stranded transfer DNA from the Ti plasmid of the soil bacteria Agrobacterium nonspecifically integrates into the plant chromosome and is inherited at subsequent cell divisions. How it is transferred across host membranes is unknown, but it is believed that VirE2 proteins form a membrane-spanning pore or channel in a lipid bilayer and possibly mediate the delivery of the single-stranded transfer DNA–VirD2–VirE2 complex to the plant cell chromosomes. The aim of this work was to perform a computer simulation of VirE2′s pore-forming capacity and an evaluation of constructed VirE2 complexes. The oscillating motions of complexes consisting of two and four VirE2 subunits were estimated by the molecular dynamics and normal modes methods. We did not predict any large changes in domain orientation for two and four-subunit VirE2 complexes within simulation times of 1 ns. A possible gating mechanism similar to that seen in the ion channels of the complex formed from two VirE2 proteins was proposed, whereas no conformational changes were predicted inside the pore in the complex formed from four VirE2 proteins.","['I.

Previous research claims that a paper’s citations are related to the node attributes of its authors in collaboration networks. We further propose that a paper’s citations can also be affected by the node attributes of its knowledge elements in knowledge networks. In this study, we develop a new method to construct the knowledge network using article keywords. Further, we explore the antecedents of paper citations from both the collaboration and knowledge network perspectives. Using wind energy paper data (16,351 records) collected from WoS (Web of Science) and JCR (Journal Citation Reports) database, we construct two distinct networks and empirically examine the hypotheses of the relationships between node attributes of two networks and the paper’s citations, which fill the gap in prior studies and will inspire related studies. We have the following key findings: in the collaboration network, the structural holes of authors have positive but non-significant effects on the paper’s citations, while the authors’ centrality has inverted U effects on the paper’s citations; in the knowledge network, the structural holes of knowledge elements are positively related to the paper’s citations, and the knowledge elements centrality has an inverted U relationship with the paper’s citations.","['Jiancheng Guan', 'Yan Yan', 'Jing Jing Zhang']",1d10691f-4653-4028-ae82-39dcd1a1c66f,0,"['0e1792fa-cbe4-4cb2-b25c-51363f148f4d', '2421ac87-d5af-4575-be50-1896045ab570', '25fbfdfe-bde7-49c9-96ba-29d5bb94f148', '2d3f1660-cc5a-48d7-85c2-9f5113bb14c1', '2d940c85-7c75-4972-81aa-ca6da9ee9450', '38d1329b-e9bc-483a-94a8-d5dc1ac9ff33', '460d9e17-6c70-4f16-83fe-889f8c02e302', '49f32121-bd13-434f-a2f9-baa78bf04c5f', '4f5f693f-0f20-4d20-929f-23f1f6b9c49c', '636713fb-d6ab-44b2-9b1d-dfbb0eb3aac8', '6b6a33fe-043b-42ba-85e2-8856f88d5ac4', '6d0959e0-384d-4cdc-a3a9-dac4fde27756', '7c49c79e-48cb-4778-9321-e751397cc630', '850a4966-5494-4c6d-8b7f-e21f4a891615', '8665ed8a-dafb-4a71-b2c5-fd46d2e2f98b', '8a92a58f-7073-46a0-a787-451b49ea4dd3', '8ba5d569-a5cc-46a1-a3fd-a1c416d45c0c', '8e085357-0600-4725-ab3f-c9a5e4e20516', '910fb23d-e01c-4d7d-8abd-3cff7033a507', '91275b8d-a875-4d69-8c6f-aa35f26c9da6', 'ace8977b-3f4e-4098-8f55-563fe41194aa', 'b65188eb-2434-4c19-8d1e-0a0b1bf303f2', 'b8ec2fae-6365-4e5a-94ac-abf8e735c60a', 'b9e1b534-94ab-451d-b3d2-2df36ce133ac', 'c5c7d289-8dbc-48c6-9e7c-f0883c860d79', 'c782d586-6e03-4415-a123-88487f6986a2', 'd01485a1-f024-4a12-b1a7-2fb580041134', 'd0bcaf70-7f9d-450c-b3e5-9d07ddadbf00', 'd19abffc-8223-465d-9041-cf1408698eb1', 'd206721d-1329-4edc-a68b-9906589620ec', 'd3685815-a99c-4dbf-852b-72560b0309d5', 'd4a0b3d9-0355-4740-95fd-1193cac90243', 'dd2e7f88-a2fc-408f-9b3f-bb63ca5ab28b', 'dda8a6b3-8131-459b-8f9d-a8a54383024e', 'e0e143ad-dffd-4187-824c-d7cbd02196cd', 'ec4a2e64-93a1-4d36-b30e-48aaccdf5ed3', 'edcf8922-93c3-4136-92df-0435cf98ec70', 'f0cb0cc3-40dc-42a7-9eb5-6d54d18a0f83', 'f4ee2efd-c592-4e8b-85e7-a796382e115c', 'ff1556b4-bb52-4430-9933-6698b4dc3b7a']",The impact of collaboration and knowledge networks on citations,Journal of Informetrics,2017
1572,"The benefits of self-tracking have been thoroughly investigated in private areas of life, like health or sustainable living, but less attention has been given to the impact and benefits of self-tracking in work-related settings. Through two field studies, we introduced and evaluated a mood self-tracking application in two call centers to investigate the role of mood self-tracking at work, as well as its impact on individuals and teams. Our studies indicate that mood self-tracking is accepted and can improve performance if the application is well integrated into the work processes and matches the management style. The results show that (i) capturing moods and explicitly relating them to work tasks facilitated reflection, (ii) mood self-tracking increased emotional awareness and this improved cohesion within teams, and (iii) proactive reactions by managers to trends and changes in team members’ mood were key for acceptance of reflection and correlated with measured improvements in work performance. These findings help to better understand the role and potential of self-tracking at the workplace, and further provide insights that guide future researchers and practitioners to design and introduce these tools in a work setting.","['Verónica Rivera-Pelayo', 'Angela Fessl', 'Lars Müller', 'Viktoria Pammer']",dfee23ec-d27f-41eb-908d-ba45462c7907,0,"['0c493a7f-80a4-4227-a9fd-18943c96a06a', '15d070bf-6e0b-4e89-ae06-d6775be3a58e', '3505efde-ddbc-4244-b555-f83f735175e2', '3542f665-0663-479d-b7e4-aaae522995fe', '369f7c06-6a6a-4312-9c9c-9d35533b6f13', '49523958-2707-4388-b64e-ad3376b1caae', '51b4b051-1328-489e-9632-41b887803e0f', '56a80dbb-8061-4a58-a3c3-eeef495db3c7', '5dae21a8-5b75-4569-b4e7-e7b071f53f0d', '6f13fab8-7c03-4b5c-b269-74da9e6532e1', '781449cf-3500-4e90-9da6-90562c904d41', '7ba32a78-d5dc-4b6f-8fd5-18c25edb83a8', '849b3a0b-072e-4fd2-a511-7aef7cd5d77c', '8536ccab-edbf-46db-9f87-b55849a645c9', '91999ffb-89f1-4fc0-8b41-ffda2845d0e7', '96caeda2-f4bb-4e9a-9ee7-10e92591f48b', '9b154f3d-5a47-43c2-9aab-190d44b09eba', '9beb3dcf-f4ad-4d66-9f4b-96f9ebdd88d3', '9ff01a14-ef58-4c15-8ac9-919f251a0de7', 'b8c48926-dbe7-4342-adf7-700494933b07', 'bae08c53-37c5-4e9c-bd19-bce67a6f4b04', 'c413136a-35b5-439b-be19-f30033912762', 'c8b7c2a7-b810-4cf4-a615-b15ad9bd0522', 'c96100f7-9e47-4c9f-b85f-725f94e3d700', 'd4d001f5-ec30-40d8-bd15-f84d83ddc419', 'e496c6bd-b6fa-47d1-9ba4-e63c0002baec', 'e834b292-0191-411b-9707-a433542b6753', 'eb1d0311-33ec-4df4-8ea4-56026261a5ae', 'f42b2290-226d-4163-897c-7329c1d0d575', 'f7748473-47e6-4e3e-94ff-e2ad24a6e0b9']",Introducing Mood Self-Tracking at Work: Empirical Insights from Call Centers,ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction,2017

1574,"In some applications, one needs not only to determine the relevant features but also provide a preferential ordering among the set of relevant features by weights. This paper presents a novel Hybrid Genetic Local Search Algorithm (HGA) in combination with the k-nearest neighbor classifier for simultaneous feature subset selection and feature weighting, particularly for medium-sized data sets. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the performance of alternative feature subset selection algorithms and classifiers through experimental analyses in the various benchmark data sets publicly available on the UCI database. The developed HGA is then applied to a data set gathered from 184 manufacturing firms in the context of innovation management. The data set consists of scores of manufacturing firms in terms of various factors that are known to influence the innovation performance of manufacturing firms and referred to as innovation determinants, and their innovation performances. HGA is used to determine the relative significance of the innovation determinants. Our results demonstrated that the developed HGA is capable of eliminating the irrelevant features and successfully assess feature weights. Moreover, our work is an example how data mining can play a role in the context of strategic management decision making.","['Duygu Yilmaz Eroglu', 'Kemal Kilic']",ca92014e-64e2-4556-98f3-7e56a7fb6f6b,0,"['06e2b3a3-7fba-4204-b9f8-8c00c710d9ac', '0d00997e-509c-47e3-a38b-ebb47f1dc449', '169fb4ba-9f09-4132-9cb2-a5d98bd3df7d', '23ab821b-841e-4e01-ae3a-b42c551a8522', '2e48e027-92ea-4b34-ad59-2a68b5bb8088', '4935259d-fca4-454d-9128-6dfed1c72357', '497f310a-4186-472c-b934-5cb7a03e4bba', '4b50d67b-6294-45df-a2f8-b20ef6d3b2d3', '4ca8e090-50cf-407c-ba4f-59dd300b484b', '4f6a3669-4523-4c14-bc31-4ac53ea63d3d', '4fb87930-7f6c-4f03-ae22-32445138ec83', '51674447-7a57-4923-a277-0d18e7b531c2', '5831cf7a-b6f3-45e9-8707-7e510ac4dcc5', '62549bc2-e0b3-46e8-8d32-390dded105d5', '685b313d-8a77-481e-9456-e405a1d29549', '6f8a39a0-5721-444c-b9b1-8ac02bea0771', '7471796e-6109-465f-ab42-44d5346a4844', '7a10be82-6113-4f60-9e37-f35f2d9423c5', '7d47fb58-9fa9-4f45-ae99-22bb1419ce52', '8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498', '96f11cdc-0225-481a-ab0f-8114c418d336', '9cdfd13e-c5c8-4550-8bc8-d683afefcfea', '9fa61eb1-0984-4492-955a-4f7aedbdc368', 'ac237969-3fd5-4303-83b7-a67e02afe976', 'c69022d0-5fc9-4612-886e-0458a887feec', 'd32b3d87-3ccf-4070-879f-e02083477a67', 'd5398b5b-4cc1-46ec-9f71-d01310c445c6', 'd674742a-2f40-456b-acd2-9de0eb0f73e5', 'da9219cb-fa1c-4241-a9eb-108c6699a80f', 'f1c6775d-a5b3-4da0-b512-a600a4b1485a']",A novel Hybrid Genetic Local Search Algorithm for feature selection and weighting with an application in strategic decision making in innovation management,Information Sciences,2017
1575,"Identifying Internet traffic applications is essential for network security and management. The steady emergence of new Internet applications, together with the use of encryption and obfuscation techniques, ensures that traffic classification remains a hot research topic. Much research has been devoted to this topic by the research community in the last decade. However, an optimal traffic classification model has yet to be defined. Many techniques and formats have been described, with the current literature therefore lacking appropriate benchmarks expressed in a consistent terminology. Moreover, existing surveys are outdated and do not include many recent advances in the field. In this article, we present a systematic multilevel taxonomy that covers a broad range of existing and recently proposed methods, together with examples of vendor classification techniques. Our taxonomy assists in defining a consistent terminology. It could be useful in future benchmarking contexts by characterizing and comparing methods at three different levels. From this perspective, we describe key features and provide design hints for future classification models, while emphasizing the main requirements for promoting future research efforts. To motivate researchers and other interested parties, we collect and share data captured from real traffic, using two models to protect data privacy.

1577,"The big-data cloud services accessed through 4G LTE-A and 5G WiFi networks need extremely high-speed and highly reliable transmission. However, it exhibits a critical issue that of inconsistently executing congestion control for the global end-to-end connection and contention control for the local wired/wireless links. For instance, in the transport layer (Layer 4 or L4), the reliable TCP adopts ACK-based congestion control to determine the congestion window (denoted by L4_CWND) for the global E2E connection; but, the link layer (Layer 2 or L2) adopts the Truncated Binary Exponential-based (TBE) access control to determine the contention window (denoted by L2_CW) for the local wireless link. Clearly, the congestion and contention control mechanisms for the global end-to-end connection and the local wireless link should cooperate tightly and consistently, but the existing congestion control and contention control are separately operated at different layers. This paper thus proposes a Cross-layer-based Adaptive Congestion Control (namely CACC) for the connection-based transport layer and the link-based media access layer. CACC aims to determine L4_CWND for the end-to-end congestion control, and then sends the cross-layer L4 congestion state to L2 to determine L2_CW_Max and L2_CW consistently.

In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving high-order neuro-fuzzy c-means algorithm for clustering heterogeneous data (PPHOFCM) on cloud computing. PPHOFCM clusters the heterogeneous data set by representing each heterogeneous data object as a tensor and uses the tensor distance to capture the correlations in the high-order tensor space. Furthermore, the cloud computing is employed to improve the clustering efficiency for massive heterogeneous data from IoT. The BGV encryption scheme is used to protect the private data when performing the high-order neuro-fuzzy c-means algorithm on cloud computing.

We will show that a Julia based MPM code, which is short, compact and readable and uses only Julia built in features, performs much better (with speed up of up to 8) than a similar Matlab based MPM code for large strain solid mechanics simulations.

Currently, underwater acoustic sensor networks have obtained high transmission distance, but with low date rate, high power consumption, high cost and damage to marine mammals. Meanwhile, underwater optical communications can achieve high date rate, but with difficult networking and short communication distance. This paper proposed a kind of novel Optical-Acoustic hybrid Underwater Wireless Sensor Network (OA-UWSN) which employed optical communication for high-speed transmission at close range and employed acoustic communication for transmitting control commands and node localization. OA-UWSN accomplished long-distance optical transmission through directional optical communication and multi-hop transmission mechanism. The problem of difficult networking in optical communication was solved by designing the whole space optical repeater. With the characteristics of directional optical transmission, the Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) technology was employed in Data Link Layer (DLL) to improve the data transmission efficiency. A routing protocol based on reverse route search was designed to improve the network life cycle and adapt to network topology which changed frequently.

1586,"A new statistical method is introduced for dose finding in phase IB/IIA trials, which, along with efficacy and toxicity as endpoints, also considers pharmacokinetic information in the dose-selection procedure. Following the assignment of a current best dose to a cohort of patients, the concentration of a drug in the blood is measured at the locally   D     D       -optimal time points. The dose–response outcomes are also observed for each patient. Based on the updated information, a new dose is selected for the next cohort so that the estimated probability of efficacy is maximum, subject to the condition that the estimated probability of toxicity is not more than a chosen constant. Another condition for the dose selection is related to the total exposure of the drug in the body, expressed by the area under the concentration curve over time, so that the curative purpose is likely to be achieved in the population without overdosing. Simultaneously to the maximisation of the estimated probability of efficacy, the mean area under the concentration curve for a chosen dose is not allowed to be more than a target value taking into account its inter-patient variability. The purpose is to investigate the gain in efficiency of using pharmacokinetic measures in the dose escalation.

One well-known approach to engineer adaptive software systems and fulfill QAs of the system is architecture-based self-adaptation. In order to develop models that capture the required knowledge of the QAs of interest, and to investigate how these models can be employed at runtime to handle multiple quality attributes, we need to first examine current architecture-based self-adaptive methods.#R##N#Objective#R##N#In this paper we review the state-of-the-art of architecture-based methods for handling multiple QAs in self-adaptive systems. We also provide a descriptive analysis of the collected data from the literature.#R##N#Method#R##N#We conducted a systematic literature review by performing an automatic search on 28 selected venues and books in the domain of self-adaptive systems. As a result, we selected 54 primary studies which we used for data extraction and analysis.#R##N#Results#R##N#Performance and cost are the most frequently addressed set of QAs. Current self-adaptive systems dealing with multiple QAs mostly belong to the domain of robotics and web-based systems paradigm. The most widely used mechanisms/models to measure and quantify QAs sets are QA data variables. After QA data variables, utility functions and Markov chain models are the most common models which are also used for decision making process and selection of the best solution in presence of many alternatives. The most widely used tools to deal with multiple QAs are PRISM and IBM's autonomic computing toolkit. KLAPER is the only language that has been specifically developed to deal with quality properties analysis.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#Our results help researchers to understand the current state of research regarding architecture-based methods for handling multiple QAs in self-adaptive systems, and to identity areas for improvement in the future. To summarize, further research is required to improve existing methods performing tradeoff analysis and preemption, and in particular, new methods may be proposed to make use of models to handle multiple QAs and to enhance and facilitate the tradeoffs analysis and decision making mechanism at runtime.","['Sara Mahdavi-Hezavehi', 'Vinicius H.

In this paper, we study the application of cooperation for interference management in the weak interference (WI) regime, focusing on the Z-interference channel with a causal relay (Z-ICR), in which the channel coefficients are subject to ergodic phase fading, all transmission powers are finite, and the relay is full-duplex. The phase fading model represents many practical communications systems in which the transmission path impairments mainly affect the phase of the signal, such as non-coherent wireless communications and fiber optic channels. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the benefits of cooperation in the WI regime, we characterize, for the first time, two major performance measures for the ergodic phase fading Z-ICR in the WI regime: the sum-rate capacity and the maximal generalized degrees-of-freedom (GDoF). In the capacity analysis, we obtain conditions on the channel coefficients, subject to which the sum-rate capacity of the ergodic phase fading Z-ICR is achieved by treating interference as noise at each receiver, and explicitly state the corresponding sum-rate capacity. In the GDoF analysis, we derive conditions on the exponents of the magnitudes of the channel coefficients, under which treating interference as noise achieves the maximal GDoF, which is explicitly characterized as well. It is shown that under certain conditions on the channel coefficients,  relaying strictly increases  both the sum-rate capacity and the maximal GDoF of the ergodic phase fading Z-interference channel in the WI regime. Our results demonstrate  for the first time  the gains from relaying in the presence of interference,  when interference is weak and the relay power is finite , both in increasing the sum-rate capacity and in increasing the maximal GDoF, compared with the channel without a relay.","['Daniel Zahavi', 'Ron Dabora']",fe2a88b2-ad81-4e17-981f-5c3b22fb0941,0,"['0b1cb7eb-85b4-434c-b2b6-859505b0da93', '151bd7ae-e93c-4eb7-a28a-ff30492c828f', '1e0b7dda-458f-46db-adef-c7c9c842aa57', '2997a4f1-1484-49f0-8283-05a1bde46c74', '307a1739-c232-44cb-af85-695dd925cc10', '3542d01b-b048-4dbd-8131-d330f3930cfa', '517ea141-e3ac-45da-bbd0-595fd4c5a647', '55dc3cef-4bc9-4f77-b3c9-9063d7e70617', '6b8121bf-443d-4a23-8761-279aeaa5d27f', '75728c7b-5878-4201-ad14-24390d818f0c', '801f1b1e-e8c0-472d-a2b1-a66f118a2307', '9a0b3239-eada-4b17-b44a-b15c5eea5b22', 'ac8fef31-1313-437e-ba52-260e1da2c447', 'b35262e0-8810-4eef-8f49-0892fbedb391', 'c0182f5d-8299-4bef-996e-8d563f77124e', 'cac3fc3f-ffc3-4b8f-a77d-078358ea6e4c', 'ceef9a86-36e8-409e-acba-7685d82e3eff', 'cef3e491-8eac-4f2a-8d6d-ec28bc7c5360', 'd03c481d-ce53-415b-b250-d4f745ecbf6d', 'd481afb7-3806-42ab-b97f-e6cc7f106c6e']",On Cooperation and Interference in the Weak Interference Regime,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,2017
1591,"In neuroscience research, mouse models are valuable tools to understand the genetic mechanisms that advance evidence-based discovery. In this context, large-scale studies emphasize the need for automated high-throughput systems providing a reproducible behavioral assessment of mutant mice with only a minimum level of manual intervention. Basic element of such systems is a robust tracking algorithm. However, common tracking algorithms are either limited by too specific model assumptions or have to be trained in an elaborate preprocessing step, which drastically limits their applicability for behavioral analysis. We present an unsupervised learning procedure that is basically built as a two-stage process to track mice in an enclosed area using shape matching and deformable segmentation models. The system is validated by comparing the tracking results with previously manually labeled landmarks in three setups with different environment, contrast and lighting conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system is able to automatically detect non-social and social behavior of interacting mice. The system demonstrates a high level of tracking accuracy and clearly outperforms the MiceProfiler, a recently proposed tracking software, which serves as benchmark for our experiments. The proposed method shows promising potential to automate behavioral screening of mice and other animals. Therefore, it could substantially increase the experimental throughput in behavioral assessment automation.","['Jakob Unger', 'Mike Mansour', 'Marcin Kopaczka', 'Nina Gronloh', 'Marc Spehr', 'Dorit Merhof']",a4bf9fa2-b858-4be5-acbc-47370667c8ab,0,"['02cbf02b-3448-44c9-979c-35a47fc8f93b', '0be756c3-95f2-422c-8a44-3a368d887001', '13916e83-8451-47cf-9055-7e8e13eb8575', '1c63e1d5-b963-455b-829d-e4f3eb63a36a', '2eb05030-f1cd-46e6-9a12-50002839f809', '51094e1c-0304-4ff5-b282-b1ca6ecc0452', '61701436-3ca4-4611-a268-20f0c6d3663c', '75bc71e0-8b97-46c4-a952-56b03736e88f', '923f5d0a-23a3-4fb1-bee7-ec72122709a4', 'b592576f-ff29-4a68-9b2f-8a8ad02e9c70', 'e902a2a2-ab00-4ea8-ad34-06fd140e510a']",An unsupervised learning approach for tracking mice in an enclosed area,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
1592,"We apply a network complexity measure to the gap junction network of the somatic nervous system of C. elegans and find that it possesses a much higher complexity than we might expect from its degree distribution alone. This “excess” complexity is seen to be caused by a relatively small set of connections involving command interneurons. We describe a method which progressively deletes these “complexity-causing” connections, and find that when these are eliminated, the network becomes significantly less complex than a random network. Furthermore, this result implicates the previously-identified set of neurons from the synaptic network’s “rich club” as the structural components encoding the network’s excess complexity. This study and our method thus support a view of the gap junction Connectome as consisting of a rather low-complexity network component whose symmetry is broken by the unique connectivities of singularly important rich club neurons, sharply increasing the complexity of the network.","['James Kunert-Graf', 'Nikita A.

1593,"In this letter, we propose a change detection method based on Gabor wavelet features for very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. First, Gabor wavelet features are extracted from two temporal VHR images to obtain spatial and contextual information. Then, the Gabor-wavelet-based difference measure (GWDM) is designed to generate the difference image. In GWDM, a new local similarity measure is defined, in which the Markov random field neighborhood system is incorporated to obtain a local relationship, and the coefficient of variation method is applied to discriminate contributions from different features. Finally, the fuzzy c-means cluster algorithm is employed to obtain the final change map. Experiments employing QuickBird and SPOT5 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","['Zhenxuan Li', 'Wenzhong Shi', 'Hua Zhang', 'Ming Hao']",6c758898-981c-4ef1-924e-30316abcedd9,0,"['01f86542-0f2d-4964-b67f-c9e506a9cb69', '0efd7136-8a18-4563-9fba-6796bd8d82e5', '5147226a-9f85-4006-ac06-86c4e3e68e04', '5cc0d11f-c427-4426-a701-dcee800f538b', '9a5c3c8c-9990-4935-8909-a283980352d5', 'a5d769f0-53ac-45f3-bb16-d3b3139e02a8', 'b687494e-77f2-4452-911a-6c07fcbf8b17', 'd47d8a54-252f-498f-b733-723a6cd54c0e', 'd8c20333-e0c2-40b8-b6ad-a3ee1e1af33c']",Change Detection Based on Gabor Wavelet Features for Very High Resolution Remote Sensing Images,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,2017
1594,"In modern physics it has become common to find the solution of a problem by solving numerically a set of PDEs. Whether solving them on a finite difference grid or by a finite element approach, the main calculations are often applied to a stencil structure. In the last decade it has become usual to work with so called big data problems where calculations are very heavy and accelerators and modern architectures are widely used. Although CPU and GPU clusters are often used to solve such problems, parallelisation of any calculation ideally starts from a single processor optimisation. Unfortunately, it is impossible to vectorise a stencil structured loop with high level instructions. In this paper we suggest a new approach to rearranging the data structure which makes it possible to apply high level vectorisation instructions to a stencil loop and which results in significant acceleration. The suggested method allows further acceleration if shared memory APIs are used. We show the effectiveness of the method by applying it to an elastic wave propagation problem on a finite difference grid. We have chosen Intel architecture for the test problem and OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) since they are extensively used in many applications.","['Sofya Titarenko', 'M. W.

1595,"Gaussian process (GP) is a popular non-parametric model for Bayesian inference. However, the performance of GP is often limited in temporal applications, where the input–output pairs are sequentially-ordered, and often exhibit time-varying non-stationarity and heteroscedasticity. In this work, we propose two particle-based GP approaches to capture these distinct temporal characteristics. Firstly, we make use of GP to design two novel state space models which take the temporal order of input–output pairs into account. Secondly, we develop two sequential-Monte-Carlo-inspired particle mechanisms to learn the latent function values and model parameters in a recursive Bayesian framework. Since the model parameters are time-varying, our approaches can model non-stationarity and heteroscedasticity of temporal data. Finally, we evaluate our proposed approaches on a number of challenging time-varying data sets to show effectiveness. By comparing with several related GP approaches, we show that our particle-based GP approaches can efficiently and accurately capture temporal characteristics in time-varying applications.","['Yali Wang', 'Brahim Chaib-draa']",9cd832a9-e74e-41bd-b240-9c9c9adc2711,0,"['00b58f05-1df7-4d88-82c6-a05d11ee7e6b', '0b371950-cc00-4ce6-ae18-d0209ab318c8', '0df33660-1849-4adf-9af3-5d3d8ebee840', '130d329c-60d3-4dcd-9618-43a3b25b630e', '1dd9b2a2-4d21-4247-b9a3-0c289562023b', '35b5158c-0925-4de7-b809-380c6c6a9e0d', '55aa4b82-fa4e-4a4b-8f32-c7135832f155', '57f0934d-5f23-465e-a054-9f4451ad71f8', '60d77233-a7f3-4bb1-8c68-d5dc388f2ec5', '67304803-c22f-4fb1-925d-38fbeba5d904', '7013d935-e516-49c9-9a4d-1cd10a91c179', '71624dc6-974a-4583-b270-4def6f3ec983', '78edf41f-bd08-4ba7-912b-1fe77a19605d', '81c7329d-7b28-4ace-9eb7-f8ba77a5f71b', '873a56c8-2030-4205-9842-4f8c81ab3060', '8fe3b8fd-f6c2-4187-aeb7-006868bf3da0', '9cba595a-1b35-4f3c-97f2-c2716a37158f', 'a66c42eb-c498-45d0-8868-3cac0fd8e4b5', 'b0f5b9fd-3b9d-40cc-be3d-d74e8d1bff8c', 'b2519a48-2dc6-41a0-b5cf-c03b2ed3e45c', 'b32ad27a-e741-4360-91f2-b0caacd7848c', 'b4cd1efb-b3d1-475b-a191-d6d0d0dc19a6', 'bdbe441f-81e8-44da-95cf-093ec68a227f', 'bf110f52-4ab3-4260-8385-cb76b6a52aa7', 'c0c12213-d7d2-40f2-9540-cc57bd814c74', 'cc826b5b-de85-4582-a417-be70a0467734', 'ce68625e-78e7-44c6-b3e1-5e9d00e96915', 'd7f08117-cd3c-4923-a818-827492423a7f', 'e9083e03-930e-4fda-b036-8cde9bff7049', 'f895453e-0aca-490d-988b-38315c03a853', 'fcae229e-3d6d-4715-97ae-25a1ab805039']",Bayesian inference for time-varying applications: Particle-based Gaussian process approaches,Neurocomputing,2017

First, motivations related to identity and opinion management are more likely to be activated when news choices are public. Second, further analysis shows that liberals were more likely to activate motivations related to identity and opinion management in the public condition. Third, our findings suggest that, among conservative respondents, the public condition elicited more politically motivated information selectivity, while for liberal respondents the private condition was more likely to lead to politically motivated choices.","['David Coppini', 'Megan A.

1597,"Possibility distribution provides an alternative explanation of linguistic terms in an hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS). It is generated from a given HFLTS based on the assumption that all linguistic terms in an HFLTS follow a uniform distribution. In decision making contexts, linguistic terms in each HFLTS are assumed to exhibit the same possibility to represent the decision-maker(DM)’s assessment rating. However, DMs may give ratings based on different assessing attitudes because of individual differences in cognitive styles. In practice, comparative linguistic expressions are generally converted into HFLTSs through the transformation process as DMs usually use comparative linguistic expressions instead of HFLTSs when giving ratings. The transformed HFLTSs likewise exclude the DMs’ assessing attitudes. To enhance the interpretability of generated possibility distributions, this paper relaxes the original assumption of uniform distribution and incorporates an attitudinal dimension into the transformation process that converts comparative linguistic expressions to HFLTSs. With these modified conditions for possibility distribution generation, an assessing attitude-driven approach is proposed based on probability density functions (PDFs) to generate HFLTS possibility distributions. The proposed PDF-based HFLTS possibility distributions personalize individual semantics and further facilitate the process of computing with words to obtain assessing attitude-embedded accurate linguistic results that are easy for individuals to interpret and understand.","['Zhen-Song Chen', 'Kwai-Sang Chin', 'Nengye Mu', 'Shenghua Xiong', 'Jian-Peng Chang', 'Yi Yang']",f8d62160-de43-40db-a716-2f1ab19299cb,0,"['0364d34c-630f-484d-bd64-dad4d25bbc45', '061ddabc-d70e-4b68-b74d-1cd668a70ad5', '12fd847e-7cf6-4612-abaa-c2cdd301570b', '13989add-7a8c-42d1-b62f-6ea42a4eca04', '18c7f02d-fa79-4a02-92e5-10a33e481a6d', '1c427c28-fe9a-490f-9613-06debb759067', '20ec3b54-251e-4121-9c78-f980cf75677f', '273b3a19-fce7-4b06-a021-e9341d7a3b61', '34225846-e01e-43d8-9cd2-850049ccf865', '389e3acc-46da-49fe-87b6-b037a0fee50b', '4881e530-b863-4cac-85c1-c7e04415ec6e', '49ce57d8-11b7-48fb-8c3b-da627892753e', '4accf67d-5246-4dae-8112-8404a5b82453', '5fcc408a-deda-4af7-8429-a8fa97750c4e', '68c0fe5a-3387-4c74-b783-2303dcee1362', '6ed47f3b-0215-4197-b7f4-bf7cf1191981', '743473da-6f4e-4e2e-98a7-c3bf3d0ad739', '777aa07b-9c1a-49d6-8da5-288d48f6f189', '7cbada72-fac4-4495-9e5c-7186109c4e7c', '7e73b6ee-7f20-44bd-9c9f-de99bfaa4f67', '9aecb6ee-eb69-495f-b7e5-26315fe84d62', '9bd8dfe8-6c74-43be-905d-393d23fd1859', 'a291aa4b-d4c1-4eaf-921e-81171fd64c2a', 'a2fdb071-627c-4fc3-a0ca-3ca240ee5c98', 'aae27086-afae-47f1-b421-4b990851f2a9', 'ae30b0b0-2710-4136-9bba-8316b9dfb88d', 'b04e0a5c-0d48-4d61-b348-bfa4cc0b2bbe', 'bccbac77-22e8-49d7-a03f-9eb037104605', 'c1e9e7d9-480d-4ded-b839-25c3dc6a9c5f', 'd1a1dc79-3887-46c3-80b1-6a546724138a', 'e1748d8e-33c6-4dbe-a398-7b05144919a7', 'ec559a3d-03ae-492a-b121-597e7d72c56f', 'f14666f8-df72-4d4f-bbe3-687f4d88cd15', 'f7d27ec4-c934-44ed-b4af-21c6a3e6c448']",Generating HFLTS possibility distribution with an embedded assessing attitude,Information Sciences,2017
1598,"In this paper, the problem of extracting a narrow-band signal in strong chaotic background is considered. A method which in simulation can extract narrow-band signal well is put forward. The proposed method is a mixed model which combines the local linear (LL) model and varying-coefficient regression model (LLVCR). We first use LL model to predict the short-term chaotic signal. Since the varying-coefficient model can fit the narrow-band signal well. We mix them and establish a mixed model to estimate the narrow-band signal in strong chaotic background. For estimating simply and effectively, we develop an efficient algorithm to select and optimize the parameters of LLVCR model those are hard to be exhaustively searched for. In the proposed algorithm, based on the short-term predictability and sensitivity to initial conditions of chaos motion, the minimum fitting error criterion is used as the objective function to get the estimation of parameters of the presented LLVCR model. In addition, the center frequencies can be detected from the fitting error of LL model by using periodogram at first. The simulation results show that LLVCR model and its estimation algorithm have appreciable flexibility to extract the narrow-band signal in different chaotic background [Lorenz, Henon and Mackey-Glass (M-G) equations].","['Liyun Su', 'Chenlong Li']",c7dc621b-bd33-4879-9109-73e5fe265fcc,0,"['2c694ce1-959f-46cc-b1a9-55bc78445c12', '68692be3-2bc1-4662-98b8-ae6e166c8c77', 'bc6fbb95-b716-4d6a-bfdd-5cd955e162dd', 'bd0a74ab-776a-439c-917f-d84879178684']",Extracting Narrow-Band Signal from a Chaotic Background with LLVCR,Wireless Personal Communications,2017

The internal model principle is shown to hold in a more general formulation than the original one, adapted to the hybrid systems considered. A numerical example is worked out with the aim of illustrating how to implement the devised technique. The geometric approach is the key methodology in attaining these results.","['Elena Zattoni', 'Anna Maria Perdon', 'Giuseppe Conte']",cb300fbe-f722-4938-8328-8c9cffd46ce4,0,"['0a510864-2391-4e6d-a73e-fbdd5f440a5b', '116c6618-4af2-4b93-9431-65d4cb8f586a', '3e8acfb4-3f91-487d-934a-11ac847a4a49', '56a56bf5-172e-46c3-82c7-388c9a3ad6ab', '80a7354e-6943-4d43-aa46-5e74ee72fb5d', '9c194344-49d8-4a8a-8171-a4abffd304ce', 'a7cfc6fc-097c-41fc-9809-b82367eba38b', 'b6f22514-127a-4f91-94bd-fd39edabe9d1', 'b88b3a4f-3b7b-469e-bfbf-5b3a4c4aba61', 'fed98734-3896-4aac-add6-0a2514448668']",Output regulation by error dynamic feedback in hybrid systems with periodic state jumps,Automatica,2017
1600,"Fourth generation networks and beyond (5G) have recently emerged to satisfy the increasing demand for high data bit rates. Cost-effective means such as small cells have been designed in 3GPP LTE-Advanced standard since the Release 10 to significantly enhance coverage and capacity. The deployment of small cells over Macrocells layer introduces a new type of networks called Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). Another cost saving concept is Self-Organizing Networks (SON) which aims at minimizing human efforts in management and operating processes. The last emerging trend for cost effectiveness is to save energy especially in access networks by turning off the unused stations. In this context, we propose a new green procedure that aims at minimizing the energy consumption in LTE-Advanced/5G access networks using Handover self-optimization SON function. We also introduce a new mathematical model for energy cost calculations. Performance evaluation results show that our proposed algorithm considerably reduces the energy consumption in the network for all scenarios related to user speed.","['Maissa Boujelben', 'Sonia Ben Rejeb', 'Sami Tabbane']",396626e9-c3f8-4056-a29e-dd3b51543ce8,0,"['116c5a62-c92e-4d6e-b5f1-607872fe6646', '9e36d99e-e3c6-4f93-9f75-ccea7ee86450', 'a25e2534-56f1-4ec7-b6de-610a785d89c3', 'b719c0c5-0661-4ed4-88f6-fd9928bf59e3', 'b921d20e-68f7-4cb0-8f88-4a1d11c865e1', 'bcb480c3-a1ed-4b1e-9288-2992016e5405', 'cc692e02-d309-4af8-9740-0b4b3d593dcb', 'f5853aa1-d2ff-4f91-845d-1707d69e357c']",SON Handover Algorithm for Green LTE-A/5G HetNets,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
1601,"A productive research in the emerging field of disaster management plays a quite important role in relaxing this disastrous advanced society. The planning problem of saving affected areas and normalizing the situation after any kind of disasters is very challenging. For the optimal use of available road network, the contraflow technique increases the outward road capacities from the disastrous areas by reversing the arcs. Number of efficient algorithms and heuristics handle this issue with contraflow reconfiguration on particular networks but the problem with multiple sources and multiple sinks is NP-hard. This paper concentrates on analytical solutions of continuous time contraflow problem. We consider the value approximation earliest arrival transshipment contraflow for the arbitrary and zero transit times on each arcs. These problems are solved with pseudo-polynomial and polynomial time complexity, respectively. We extend the concept of dynamic contraflow to the more general setting where the given network is replaced by an abstract contraflow with a system of linearly ordered sets, called paths satisfying the switching property. We introduce the continuous maximum abstract contraflow problem and present polynomial time algorithms to solve its static and dynamic versions by reversing the direction of paths. Abstract contraflow approach not only increases the flow value but also eliminates the crossing at intersections. The flow value can be increased up to double with contraflow reconfiguration.","['Urmila Pyakurel', 'Tanka Nath Dhamala', 'Stephan Dempe']",d76387a4-bcb6-488a-82c9-b359b6e5cfe5,0,"['14c61235-bbc8-4401-a5cb-091eced5b2d7', '2396f643-6810-4c1f-859a-7247962ad4e4', '5610ff3b-2c2c-455c-a2c0-f19621ef9f59', '5d7c7cf4-f5d1-4f59-b203-b316ac10f4f7', '5dc9bb51-7011-4b21-8939-16c363a86548', '67aaa842-cce9-460c-a80f-28fe1baf25be', '6cfc836e-2883-4d3c-be9a-bc35a0078bf6', '7f5b04dc-e332-46d7-b307-d928c7152174', '939cf47e-a99a-418c-802d-ead267a34d9e', 'a7c31c7f-9b97-43f4-9776-060118d9e25a', 'b482d99b-72c2-48b2-8f5d-fa6f1f9b63ec', 'c5349214-e971-4b91-9dfc-617eb8f7e412', 'e6afb65c-1b8c-4347-9468-34451f9410ee', 'e6c57be8-e712-46a4-9142-16c0b8c223e6', 'e98a9909-6308-4483-904d-85664fe4eb4a', 'ee57ec14-a428-48a4-9cef-c6d5e4d87b1d']",Efficient continuous contraflow algorithms for evacuation planning problems,Annals of Operations Research,2017
1602,"Abstract In this paper, which is a continuation of the discrete-time paper (Bjork and Murgoci in Finance Stoch. 18:545–592, 2004), we study a class of continuous-time stochastic control problems which, in various ways, are time-inconsistent in the sense that they do not admit a Bellman optimality principle. We study these problems within a game-theoretic framework, and we look for Nash subgame perfect equilibrium points. For a general controlled continuous-time Markov process and a fairly general objective functional, we derive an extension of the standard Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, in the form of a system of nonlinear equations, for the determination of the equilibrium strategy as well as the equilibrium value function. The main theoretical result is a verification theorem. As an application of the general theory, we study a time-inconsistent linear-quadratic regulator. We also present a study of time-inconsistency within the framework of a general equilibrium production economy of Cox–Ingersoll–Ross type (Cox et al. in Econometrica 53:363–384, 1985).","['Tomas Björk', 'Mariana Khapko', 'Agatha Murgoci']",0c59707b-1102-4f03-a536-49d63619bf5c,0,"['1d6bef8b-78c3-42cf-b793-3c389916f18a', '70e58fdf-0ef2-49f5-8417-b04b1a71e904', 'ac76904e-00a5-4c5a-b2be-0ffdca5ea88f', 'd8470574-922b-4cc7-b5a5-1955f4595543']",On time-inconsistent stochastic control in continuous time,Finance and Stochastics,2017

First, the sample is classified into two classes of process industries: the adopters of lean and those who have not yet adopted the lean practices in their manufacturing operations. Then statistical tests are conducted to measure the differences in the level of performance between the two classes of Indian process industries with respect to nine performance measures.

1604,"Recent studies have shown that the crosstalk between microRNA (miRNA) sponges plays an important role in human cancers. However, the co-regulation roles of miRNA sponges in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are still unknown. In this study, we propose a multi-step method called miRSCoPPI to infer miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs. We focus on investigating breast cancer (BRCA) related miRNA sponge co-regulation, by integrating heterogeneous data, including miRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data, experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions, PPIs and lncRNA-target interactions, and the list of breast cancer genes. We find that the inferred BRCA-related miRSCoPPI network is highly connected and scale free. The top 10% hub genes in the BRCA-related miRSCoPPI network have potential biological implications in breast cancer. By utilizing a graph clustering method, we discover 17 BRCA-related miRSCoPPI modules. Through pathway enrichment analysis of the modules, we find that several modules are significantly enriched in pathways associated with breast cancer. Moreover, 10 modules have good performance in classifying breast tumor and normal samples, and can act as module signatures for prognostication. By using putative computationally predicted miRNA-target interactions, we have consistent results with those obtained using experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions, indicating that miRSCoPPI is robust in inferring miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs in human breast cancer. Taken together, the results demonstrate that miRSCoPPI is a promising tool for inferring BRCA-related miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs and it can help with the understanding of the co-regulation roles of miRNA sponges on the PPIs.","['Junpeng Zhang', 'Thuc Duy Le', 'Lin Liu', 'Jiuyong Li']",aa3f94a1-14f2-4790-ba41-b9340af3b765,0,"['1dc4a8dc-bee8-4769-bf0e-7a5850201b22', '297bb60e-3ecc-45dd-86c3-63d7233b7ba4', '2a363ddf-b147-4388-b4e5-7acce203bd6b', '3cff3e59-38ce-44d1-afa8-92730e95ff2a', '454dbaf3-def9-4de5-ad91-616ba31db729', '4ab6c0ff-2d1a-4cb0-acdc-8ca7517cb14a', '4f8012fa-44a5-45d2-bf21-b00bc8dcece6', '50de87d8-93dd-4493-acbf-70862ebb0047', '6f719406-8041-4ff0-9c0c-5e0c4f323c4c', '7f0c0eb4-7517-4c36-a2a6-067cd48e8ec5', '7fd69e44-dbda-4713-bf48-2ffb767a8965', '80705d99-286e-4351-9f4c-621118d10739', '9d0dfc61-273e-425c-bba8-7df51ee02023', 'b6fd50d0-434d-4c75-bbd9-3f28946df5e3', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'd536f87d-bbda-42a1-b55f-63f83bfd85da', 'f75d4063-9f24-4d1f-a638-6849e04681a3']",Inferring miRNA sponge co-regulation of protein-protein interactions in human breast cancer,BMC Bioinformatics,2017
1605,"This paper proposes to estimate parametric nonlinear transformations of i-vectors for speaker recognition systems based on Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) classification. The Gaussian PLDA model assumes that the i-vectors are distributed according to the standard normal distribution. However it has been shown that the i-vectors are better modeled, for example, by Heavy-Tailed distributions, and that significant improvement of the classification performance can be obtained by whitening and length normalizing the i-vectors. In this work we propose to transform the i-vectors so that their distribution becomes more suitable to discriminate speakers using the PLDA model. This is performed by means of a sequence of affine and non-linear transformations whose parameters are obtained by Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation on the development set. Another contribution of this work is the reduction of the mismatch between the development and evaluation i-vector length distributions by means of a scaling factor tuned for the estimated i-vector distribution, rather than by means of a blind length normalization. Relative improvement between 7% and 14% of the Detection Cost Function was obtained with the proposed technique on the NIST SRE-2010 and SRE-2012 evaluation datasets, using both the traditional GMM/UBM and the hybrid DNN/GMM based systems.","['Sandro Cumani', 'Pietro Laface']",3fe8db64-2f17-40bf-a304-6ae20c6b0108,0,"['0a84abdd-74bf-4027-9ec7-ca615909b8dc', '100b17ba-ff14-4970-9d45-16dc5ee670e5', '1690f002-7d30-4de5-b643-652b7de3e2e0', '16b82cfb-8029-4733-9ddd-4ca759abe0e4', '20e4b723-b541-45ef-8353-b31da9ac18b9', '3f2f93e5-8e34-4eb0-9623-0bbf40ea63f1', '61977e71-d7c2-44f0-8eed-8d912f948fb9', '7553c3b9-fd69-44b0-b26f-bb342965b8cd', '7c1c25ec-df2d-4918-b410-52ab17f388d8', '92738be5-920e-4596-8fc8-99cc2f3bcfc2', '97cf7f10-646e-48d0-b408-c7339aa514fc', 'a7478a4b-8f31-4ed7-8ea0-c3240aafb6bd', 'b8269cfc-76b9-40ea-8a61-a4d52c91493d', 'c5ed206f-6f74-421a-b149-31ae1ef4baf6', 'efdc43ad-7029-4199-bfb0-e28168311089']",Nonlinear I-Vector Transformations for PLDA-Based Speaker Recognition,"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing",2017
1606,"The explosive growth of cloud computing had resulted in the growth of fields such as ubiquitous computing, mobile cloud computing, Big Data Analytics and Cyber Physical Systems etc., Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is the integration of Mobile computing and Cloud computing and has gained tremendous popularity in recent years. In MCC, mobile users access the cloud services with the mobile device. Generally, the users of mobile cloud can select their services from the broker using an agent. There is an agreement between the users and service provider called SLA. Data are of varying types and they require different security levels based on their requirement. Classification of Mobile user’s data is a time-consuming process. A superior naive classifier for secure data classification in agent based mobile cloud computing is proposed in this paper. The agent classifies the user’s data into three different groups namely, low, medium, high. Then, the data are encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standards (AES). Encrypted data is transferred to the broker for selecting for suitable service agent.But the broker has many to one relationship with service agents. Then the data is sent to the cloud service provider for storage. The stored data is then homomorphically encrypted which enables the cloud provider and cloud user to process the data without the need for decryption. Performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed method reduces classification time and provides better security and integrity on mobile cloud data.","['K. S. Arvind', 'R.

1608,"Artisanal gold mining (galamsey) and cocoa farming are essential sources of income for local populations in Ghana. Unfortunately the former poses serious threats to the environment and human health, and conflicts with cocoa farming and other livelihoods. Timely and spatially referenced information on the extent of galamsey is needed to understand and limit the negative impacts of mining. To address this, we use multi-date UK-DMC2 satellite images to map the extent and expansion of galamsey from 2011 to 2015. We map the total area of galamsey in 2013 over the cocoa growing area, using k-means clustering on a cloud-free 2013 image with strong spectral contrast between galamsey and the surrounding vegetation. We also process a pair of hazy images from 2011 and 2015 with Multivariate Alteration Detection to map the 2011–2015 galamsey expansion in a subset, labelled the change area. We use a set of visually interpreted random sample points to compute bias-corrected area estimates. We also delineate an indicative impact zone of pollution proportional to the density of galamsey, assuming a maximum radius of 10 km. In the cocoa growing area of Ghana, the estimated total area of galamsey in 2013 is 27,839 ha with an impact zone of 551,496 ha. In the change area, galamsey has more than tripled between 2011 and 2015, resulting in 603 ha of direct encroachment into protected forest reserves. Assuming the same growth rate for the rest of the cocoa growing area, the total area of galamsey in 2015 is estimated at 43,879 ha.

1610,"Magnetically suspended rotor has the characteristics of no friction and active vibration control. The mass unbalance and sensor runout of the rotor induce harmonic current, which will cause harmonic vibration. The ratio of the sampling rate to the fundamental frequency of harmonic current is often not an integer. The existing repetitive control (RC) for the suppression of harmonic current in magnetic bearing is applicable for the integer case. Harmonic current suppression performance is degraded drastically if the ratio is fractional. In this paper, combined finite-impulse response (FIR) and fractional-order RC is proposed. FIR filter and fractional-order RC are combined to perform harmonic current suppression at arbitrary frequency. Phase compensator is designed to enhance the stability of magnetically suspended rotor system. Experimental results are given to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","['Peiling Cui', 'Qirui Wang', 'Sheng Li', 'Qian Gao']",616d2179-65eb-4764-8482-67582f482841,0,"['185172ac-40da-4748-9ab1-2d25fad024ca', '4099182a-9cfc-466d-9f13-aa808dd79b79', '4736a032-5b29-49a7-8b2f-605b56cf8f3f', 'ac28edfa-1dca-49c5-94be-5d5b37da9c88', 'b0412ac8-b692-43d9-981c-44545ef556cb', 'd45a8a20-f505-46f3-a270-e15d2c308f63', 'da1ec2e4-3437-4978-910d-87681d568042']",Combined FIR and Fractional-Order Repetitive Control for Harmonic Current Suppression of Magnetically Suspended Rotor System,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2017
1611,"We consider the problem of robust compressed sensing where the objective is to recover a high-dimensional sparse signal from compressed measurements partially corrupted by outliers. A new sparse Bayesian learning method is developed for this purpose. The basic idea of the proposed method is to identify the outliers and exclude them from sparse signal recovery. To automatically identify the outliers, we employ a set of binary indicator variables to indicate which observations are outliers. These indicator variables are assigned a beta-Bernoulli hierarchical prior such that their values are confined to be binary. In addition, a Gaussian-inverse Gamma prior is imposed on the sparse signal to promote sparsity. Based on this hierarchical prior model, we develop a variational Bayesian method to estimate the indicator variables as well as the sparse signal. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves a substantial performance improvement over existing robust compressed sensing techniques.","['Q.

We investigate the impact of the additive quantization model on the proposed two-stage averaging based algorithm. Existing works on the effect of the additive model show that convergence can be guaranteed only if the quantization error variances form a convergent series. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves the performance of the optimal centralized estimate even if the quantization error variances are not vanishing. This is guaranteed by establishing a law of the iterated logarithm for weighted sums of independent random vectors. Moreover, an explicit bound of the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is given to quantify its almost sure performance.","['Shanying Zhu', 'Shuai Liu', 'Yeng Chai Soh', 'Lihua Xie']",e1b9800b-c6ca-4fb6-b42c-1b59d1a36d13,0,"['0aed8a11-15e1-4915-9563-f672e773dac6', '0dbd2735-2753-4936-80e3-bd8648451ee6', '1ad64563-9773-4d7c-921e-9135b919b18b', '274afee7-f070-45ec-bd4b-09bd4424bb85', '28db9157-9c95-4204-9ee1-848c3a587a2e', '2a71c985-5219-419d-8d7c-6113f50701f7', '364a4923-876a-41e2-9510-990610ae8b7d', '46ca91ae-6649-4fae-89e7-da95071b2906', '522ae812-d85e-42c3-8dab-34082fb99e7d', '57885602-3894-4326-8005-31a8ca7f0f67', '6160e692-87fa-424d-ac9d-1ca39decd801', '6a46a34e-b801-4a3f-ab61-a9ddf3bf8643', '6d80eae4-5a33-4bc2-8f9c-3db5ec836183', '70a55c7e-cf9c-4408-ba96-ffc00ffe8771', '7d6848ec-719d-4d8f-b0f2-7eef4c7f6a5c', '8be2b2e1-d945-4e32-87b0-8f84fce3b648', '949ed5e7-e1bb-4c33-85cb-6505cfefd31a', '9dce4d0d-5534-4957-9ac5-5ed43e51049e', 'b81e4d7e-ad2b-4837-8e5d-f394c79c4cb5', 'bb352f7c-946c-4518-9e58-820cbc146657', 'c0d3973e-09e1-4a97-8d11-ca5fb03df9c7', 'c5b14c63-099c-44bc-a8f7-da9585d473f7', 'd643861b-1fb0-4f7e-9485-0a5c3330b482', 'dd32638e-29f9-48ef-a2da-8ab31a54d387', 'eb1fdec2-f1ff-494e-a6f6-4bfe71c6d005', 'f888914d-eb86-48c9-a267-0cdd4b6991d9']",Performance analysis of averaging based distributed estimation algorithm with additive quantization model,Automatica,2017

Under a mild assumption on the high-frequency gain matrix and strongly minimum-phase assumption, a robust regulator is proposed with the combination of nonlinear internal model and a new extended high-gain observer. More explicitly, the robust output regulation is achieved by employing a novel extended high-gain observer-based stabilizer such that the regulated system, augmented with the nonlinear internal model, is asymptotically stabilized. The novelty of this approach consists in the use of an extended observer to estimate, under mild assumptions, all unmeasured terms.","['Lei Wang', 'Alberto Isidori', 'Zhitao Liu', 'Hongye Su']",a4ccae4e-256d-40ca-b8b1-94aee36e5de1,0,"['1c46fac6-69e0-419e-b676-5ba949c680c9', '29c25b35-a415-4ca8-a568-0a6c1c6028f9', '488638dd-9762-47b1-90af-ac065c9286cb', '4fd3dc90-4cf6-432a-a1ff-32a814624677', '5fd63f9b-7380-4bb3-852d-6e63ea01c966', '70b8db60-eb5f-41f8-9aef-5c0a1556f89d', '710b4db0-9963-47bf-9d92-bb38141d1e11', 'ce6e6618-6006-49b3-81e5-3e5eb5245890', 'e0eca1af-fcd4-4bbd-8ea2-944ca4b26df1', 'e491fd19-ca7e-493e-b940-c285a4508f64', 'f5bc90df-c50f-4e5d-b2ac-cceb0a5e9e0c']",Robust output regulation for invertible nonlinear MIMO systems,Automatica,2017

Using international survey data from 412 young adults aged between 18-25 years of age (M = 21.20 years, SD = 2.31 years), this study demonstrates that there is a relationship between exposure to online content depicting risky behavior and users’ own offline risky behavior. This relationship was found for six behaviors: drug use, excessive alcohol use, disordered eating, self-harm, violence to others, and dangerous pranks. A borderline effect was found for two further behaviors: unprotected sex and sex with a stranger. The relationship between content depicting disordered eating and offline behavior was only significant for females; suggesting that female users may be more vulnerable to effects of viewing content depicting disordered eating habits, and/or use social media content to find material related to their existing behavior. No other gender moderation effects were found.

Failing to correct this misreporting introduces biases and it may lead to misinformed decision making. Our work provides methods of correcting for this bias, by reinterpreting it as a missing data problem, and particularly learning from positive and unlabelled data. Focusing on information theoretic approaches we have three key contributions: (1) we provide a method to perform valid independence tests with known power by incorporating prior knowledge over misreporting; (2) we derive corrections for point/interval estimates of the mutual information that capture both relevance and redundancy; and finally, (3) we derive different ways for ranking under-reported risk factors. Furthermore, we show how to use our results in real-world problems and machine learning tasks.","['Konstantinos Sechidis', 'Matthew Sperrin', 'Emily S Petherick', 'Mikel Luján', 'G.

1619,"The reinforced concrete beams is a structural member that is widely used in all types of building and civil constructions. These beams are subjected to different external loads that, above a critical value, may cause the collapse of the whole structure, having devastating consequences for civilians. Therefore, the a priori simulation of the internal forces developed within a reinforced concrete beam, when it is subjected to external loads, is mandatory to figure out its progressive structural response, to provide integrated risk assessment for a wide range of constructions such as buildings, bridges, etc. In this paper, we provide a simulation framework to estimate the behavior of reinforced concrete beams when they are subjected to external loads. Of particular interest to us is the simulation of the particularly damaging internal force, called  Shear force . Several techniques are under study such as regression analysis, Little Genetic Algorithm (LGA) and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), along with different objective functions (lineal, polynomial and rational functions) to provide a solution that satisfies both the physical and computational constraints of the targeted problem. These techniques are empirically optimized by using different parameters and genetic operators such as elitism, penalization for unfeasible individuals, crossing by one point or by linear combination of two individuals, mutation by gen or by individual. Numerical results reveal that CMA-ES algorithm together with a proper objective function, elitism and penalization allows predicting, under a relative error less than 5% (compared to experimental data taken from a tested beam), the shear response of a reinforced concrete beam in the stages near to the structural collapse.","['Raquel Martínez España', 'A.M.

1620,"Reliability evaluation of multi-state systems gives a reasonable demonstration of system performance, and thus is of great importance to their planning, designing and operation. One of the common methods for reliability evaluation is using d-minimal cuts (d-MCs). This paper proposes a new method to solve the d-MC problem. Specifically, several efforts have been devoted to searching for all d-MCs from two aspects: (i) A new technique is developed to calculate lower capacity bounds of edges which are appropriately used to determine some real d-MCs without any verification, and further to reduce the number of d-MC candidates; (ii) A new approach is put forward to correctly and effectively detect duplicate d-MCs, and the approach brings important insights into the underlying reason why a d-MC derived from one MC can be generated from another MC once again. A simple example and a real case study of the LCD monitor delivery are provided to illustrate the solution procedure, and the utility of the proposed algorithm, respectively.

1622,"In contrast to active radar systems, in which the transmitted waveforms are carefully selected and designed in relation to the radar operational modes and requirements, passive radars (PRs) exploiting noncooperative illuminators of opportunity need to cope with waveforms that are not tailored for the radar applications. In the latter case, it is likely that target echoes are masked by echoes from other strong targets in multitarget scenarios. This fact inspired us to model the multitarget detection problem in the PRs as an M-ary hypothesis testing problem. We then employ the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) principle to derive the GLR-based detector. A parallel and recursive implementation of the detector is presented for computationally efficient implementation, in which the targets are detected sequentially and the previously detected targets are treated as interferences to be removed yielding the detection of the weakest ones. The false alarm and detection performance of the proposed sequential GLR-based detector are analytically studied using asymptotic distribution and also their accuracies are verified numerically. Simulation results show that there is a high agreement between asymptotic performance and the one obtained by simulation results. Extensive simulation results for both FM- and DVB-T-based PRs are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection algorithm. Furthermore, it can be revealed from our simulation results that the proposed detection algorithm significantly outperforms the existing methods without adding significant complexity to them.",['Amir Zaimbashi'],1f12a484-968e-46c7-8ee3-c21e61195c95,0,"['2a4446d9-906e-44b0-90f5-44b8fda516f6', '2b77f4f3-1d76-47ed-90d4-7a5ad4784456', '58429396-7c48-4f40-8478-97cc38f4effe', '7ef87bb4-185a-40e3-aa0a-2340c9a3768c', '861021fb-c4fd-4433-b578-b7e15658707e', 'cd1839ab-76e2-4bac-ba04-f4486b4ccab8', 'df217d70-0799-4816-886c-43184d742a81', 'e533f673-14d4-412a-a2d1-e7d9dbbe7dfc', 'e9cfdf36-0f3f-4612-a881-bfb400bfa8b2', 'f7dae9d3-76f0-4d39-9ecb-3f108c8a0634']",Forward M-Ary Hypothesis Testing Based Detection Approach for Passive Radar,IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2017

1626,"Manifest contracts track precise program properties by refining types with predicates—for example, l x :Intm  x  > 0r denotes the positive integers. Contracts and polymorphism make a natural combination: programmers can give strong contracts to abstract types, precisely stating pre- and post conditions while hiding implementation details— for instance, an abstract type of stacks might specify that the pop operation has input type l x :α Stack m not (empty  x )r.   This article studies a polymorphic calculus with manifest contracts and establishes fundamental properties including type soundness and relational parametricity. Indeed, this is not the first work on polymorphic manifest contracts, but existing calculi are not very satisfactory. Gronski et al. developed the S age  language, which introduces polymorphism through the Type:Type discipline, but they do not study parametricity. Some authors of this article have produced two separate works: Belo et al. [2011] and Greenberg [2013] studied polymorphic manifest contracts and parametricity, but their calculi have metatheoretical problems in the type conversion relations. Indeed, they depend on a few conjectures, which turn out to be false. Our calculus is the first polymorphic manifest calculus with parametricity, depending on no conjectures—it resolves the issues in prior calculi with delayed substitution on casts.","['Taro Sekiyama', 'Atsushi Igarashi', 'Michael Greenberg']",65bed260-ef77-4213-8ac5-60f7d0917fc8,50,"['029a1e9b-fa5e-4709-9278-6f3ea9e3a9fc', '07e7802d-3786-4249-9db8-469fea8640e2', '0a4e2903-2512-4f0f-b5cd-3772a49a0e44', '1141010e-9103-4c6a-bf9e-b518a0a222e5', '1256e162-fa80-4245-b35c-f5a22e97dbc8', '141dbeb8-fd64-41ee-a0c6-1dabeeaf7a93', '14c252ca-1a7f-4faf-abab-1a2e807e34b6', '1ccac1b8-e5fb-4158-859d-5dbce9a07390', '21d3fc3b-da3e-4b5a-9d72-ac72a15df43b', '28c349fc-eff4-4898-8623-5b1771effb20', '2b23f920-84ba-4fe2-958b-fc3a875ee5e7', '2c01de47-6df9-45e2-b81c-eb797cb784c4', '2cca1c61-cbfc-431b-add8-ebc0debf33eb', '2df9773f-2923-40a9-be29-988816fb7c0a', '2f554e64-1a46-4733-aa14-2d5204efbbc1', '35c8c06c-2ad0-46b4-9e92-2d684f3abd94', '372b19b3-ef03-47a4-b4c6-dc509bf8c7c6', '50d21f72-db9d-4a19-a8a9-274d9eccc04c', '5dff3397-0f2b-4726-8add-08120ff34919', '6cc5f62d-f446-4944-ada8-971a2c5c34b0', '6d2c4cdf-0c29-4201-bcbf-34acd93738d4', '6d3715f8-ad66-4fd4-bd2a-b282e4c9f113', '7b712b76-32a0-447f-b613-751ce0b26f33', '84990f63-9de2-49f0-ac5b-6fa6fe659f84', '86198c1a-3697-4d03-ab8d-c92dd192adb0', 'ad6b745c-9d2d-4421-b2d2-2ed407d1c596', 'b0dced3a-8ca0-4c05-826d-8dec708b35b5', 'b3a00e11-06b5-4d6d-af87-409232f1be02', 'b3d0a0c5-7978-4e96-807c-6176d46a2819', 'b5cc3906-2ac1-45cd-bbf6-de94b8a65c1b', 'b8eaf6d5-95d3-4722-99ec-82c144489cfa', 'bb17e3c8-01b3-4ebb-b609-28759c469a4c', 'bb4fdd30-53f4-4e8e-ab09-5c62b604ee59', 'bd38e624-3e3e-43a2-a432-8a524693c2e1', 'c1b2f71a-23a2-45d2-ad21-8d930c907b1e', 'c2e6d7b4-34a4-4b5c-9699-ad4483ef6580', 'c6c3413f-2c37-42dc-bef2-4ae83b60882a', 'cd6fe0f5-0956-4bb5-8d66-0b5b564dc8e3', 'cf10fdf6-e6e4-47ef-bdf1-55e5dd1cf1ff', 'd4f5860d-0fa6-4ffd-b940-b0773b27b0ad', 'd58f11f8-eefa-44b1-bfce-2622478692f2', 'd7bf7679-5a4a-413e-b72d-e46f117f148a', 'da01acd6-e9a7-49e6-99f0-0c7cbc07066f', 'da0809c9-86b3-4990-b828-39099ba99817', 'e55ab9d8-f5c5-4b09-a750-bc6d322d8f56', 'fa5a5104-cbcb-47e2-96c1-1da2e5228732']","Polymorphic Manifest Contracts, Revised and Resolved",ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems,2017
1627,"We examined relationships between individual differences in orthographic priming and a battery of measures assessing orthographic processing ability, reading history, current reading ability, and verbal intelligence in university students. Pronounceable and unpronounceable nonword primes preceded word and nonword targets. Individual differences in nonword reading skill and other measures of reading and spelling ability were associated with the degree of orthographic priming. Individuals with less phonological decoding skill benefited more from anagram primes for word targets preceded by unpronounceable primes and nonword targets preceded by pronounceable primes. Analyses of extreme groups revealed that the group with the lowest phonemic decoding efficiency scores showed a general benefit of orthographic relatedness, while the group with the highest phonemic decoding efficiency scores showed a benefit only under certain conditions. Thus, individuals with worse nonword reading skills may have less precise orthographic representations and therefore benefit more from overlapping coarse-grained orthographic information, regardless of the pronounceability of the prime or the lexical status of the target. These findings demonstrate that university students vary in their orthographic processing skill and the degree to which orthographic information is used during word recognition.","['Suzanne E.

1630,"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enables the ""softwarization"" of network functions, which are implemented on virtual machines hosted on Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers. Both the composition of the virtual network functions (VNFs) into a forwarding graph (FG) at the logical layer and the embedding of the FG on the servers need to take into account the less-than-carrier-grade reliability of COTS components. This work investigates the trade-off between end-to-end reliability and computational load per server via the joint design of VNF chain composition (CC) and FG embedding (FGE) under the assumption of a bipartite FG that consists of controller and regular VNFs. Evaluating the reliability criterion within a probabilistic model, analytical insights are first provided for a simplified disconnected FG. Then, a block coordinate descent method based on mixed-integer linear programming is proposed to tackle the joint optimization of CC and FGE. Via simulation results, it is observed that a joint design of CC and FGE leads to substantial performance gains compared to separate optimization approaches.","['Jinkyu Kang', 'Osvaldo Simeone', 'Joonhyuk Kang']",d773d66c-b471-46c4-b061-82b793dee3a8,0,"['039f7090-4377-47c0-b98c-f105e4638648', '08e7caf0-ef92-4275-a036-17d8e20c3712', '45ca2c1b-d90e-4b33-8a84-3f86c421a2b0', '4a20c680-fa40-47b3-b90d-1e920c531da5', '6638a8fa-fffc-48f5-a84d-f882c8a2a901', '8f145e1d-eb63-4cc0-9614-ba993c773ab6', 'c5751f7a-c03b-47f9-9d78-ce7bb0fc2587']",On the Trade-Off between Computational Load and Reliability for Network Function Virtualization,IEEE Communications Letters,2017

A framework for environmental portfolio decision analysis is provided that consists of steps ranging from problem framing to modelling and optimization, as well as to the analysis of results. The use of this framework is demonstrated with an illustrative case describing planning of urban water services.

1632,"This work presents the concept of Cascade Feature Selection to combine feature selection methods. Fast and weak methods, like ranking, are placed on the top of the cascade to reduce the dimensionality of the initial feature set. Thus, strong and computationally demanding methods, placed on the bottom of the cascade, have to deal with less features. Three cascade combinations are tested with the Extreme Learning Machine as the underlying classification architecture. The Tennessee Eastman chemical process simulation software and one high-dimensional data set are used as sources of the benchmark data. Experimental results suggest that the cascade arrangement can produce smaller final feature subsets, expending less time, with higher classification performances than a feature selection based on a Genetic Algorithm. Many works in the literature have proposed mixed methods with specific combination strategies. The main contribution of this work is a concept able to combine any existent method using a single strategy. Provided that the Cascade Feature Selection requirements are fulfilled, the combinations might reduce the time to select features or increase the classification performance of the classifiers trained with the selected features.","['Francisco de Assis Boldt', 'Thomas W.

In addition, we applied the method of Characteristic Scores and Scales (CSS) to analyse the distributions of citations and usage counts to further test the relation between the usage and citation impact. The results show that citations and usage counts in WoS correlate significantly, especially in the social sciences. However, higher numbers of co-authors are not associated with higher usage counts or citations. Furthermore, the stability of CSS-class distributions substantiates the applicability of CSS in characterising both usage and citation distributions. Distinctly different patterns in citations and usage are observed, but the similarities within citations and usage in these fields are somewhat unexpected.","['Pei Shan Chi', 'Wolfgang Glänzel']",585008c6-91d5-4441-82a0-7a6ad28e01dd,0,"['00e856e1-3ad9-42b0-9d00-694d51630e2d', '15dbb226-b5ee-4be9-8085-775eefa0308f', '161a0f9c-3068-44d9-8275-012b88052f67', '4ab3646e-d5ba-415f-a38e-d547f7c38f86', '6b9d985c-50ac-4182-847d-349085b13c77', '723848d8-8866-407b-abfe-6e57242e5f69', '7ebfa8db-6293-4071-96fd-ed512bcd28ff', '8a20e439-029c-48b0-822b-15a527e092ba', '9d697d65-8b98-47c8-98d5-dfcbd8051565', '9ec0be7b-1fa3-4507-90df-bedb1dffcdf6', 'ab01107a-a69d-4f8f-942e-cf284acdb953', 'c75e2101-154a-445f-97af-9f61fac68d98', 'd094058e-8858-4d5d-a23a-cf9ad64d0493', 'f250c381-2586-4229-90da-3670ed4d3576']","An empirical investigation of the associations among usage, scientific collaboration and citation impact",Scientometrics,2017

Here, we explore the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in resolving ambiguity in the identity of speech sounds using syllables that contain ambiguous phonetic segments (e.g., intermediate sounds between /b/ and /g/ as in “blade” and “glade”). We used an audio-morphing procedure to create a large set of natural sounding minimal pairs that contain phonetically ambiguous onset or offset consonants (differing in place, manner, or voicing). These ambiguous segments occurred in different lexical contexts (i.e., in words or pseudowords, such as blade–glade or blem–glem) and in different phonological environments (i.e., with neighboring syllables that differed in lexical status, such as blouse–glouse). These stimuli allowed us to explore the impact of phonetic ambiguity on the speed and accuracy of lexical decision responses (Experiment 1), semantic categorization responses (Exper...","['Jack Rogers', 'Matthew H.

1635,"Conventional Functional connectivity (FC) analysis focuses on characterizing the correlation between two brain regions, whereas the high-order FC can model the correlation between two brain region pairs. To reduce the number of brain region pairs, clustering is applied to group all the brain region pairs into a small number of clusters. Then, a high-order FC network can be constructed based on the clustering result. By varying the number of clusters, multiple high-order FC networks can be generated and the one with the best overall performance can be finally selected. However, the important information contained in other networks may be simply discarded. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to make full use of the information contained in all high-order FC networks. First, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique is applied such that the clustering result in one layer always depends on the previous layer, thus making the high-order FC networks in the two consecutive layers highly correlated. As a result, the features extracted from high-order FC network in each layer can be decomposed into two parts (blocks), i.e., one is redundant while the other might be informative or complementary, with respect to its previous layer. Then, a selective feature fusion method, which combines sequential forward selection and sparse regression, is developed to select a feature set from those informative feature blocks for classification. Experimental results confirm that our novel method outperforms the best single high-order FC network in diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects.","['Xiaobo Chen', 'Han Zhang', 'Seong-Whan Lee', 'Dinggang Shen']",92f08370-07e1-4ec2-be2c-04a0d6c0a707,0,"['13a37d0f-3ff4-47d9-8431-5b2057ae1b47', '1b874c31-771a-4df9-b388-8f4564df44bd', '1df56145-a26e-4eb1-8b97-cb3e4324d746', '34bf87b4-e693-496b-8d98-e0caec33de30', '4e59a119-55d0-4b92-9ea3-820e593e2f08', '50dd56db-151d-4d62-8576-65f0ef6f381b', '52c014b5-ac27-4d4c-9baa-4f8fd326a0a5', '58a07425-d0f8-4f3b-a24f-4aaffe5aacf3', '6779f440-f955-436f-b00a-4c32e8c29794', '685b313d-8a77-481e-9456-e405a1d29549', '686a58f7-bb3a-4ab3-8f27-8069e1301db2', '690160a5-3588-4599-99c1-52bdafc3ec5f', '7236dbb7-f0b2-4e28-bb7c-6de187c32d64', '74138456-bed6-43be-8bba-15799c871c26', '93c06494-5b99-457b-aa91-308b67541057', 'a8898bdd-0950-44d4-9393-12a3353536f9', 'b1067825-8ba0-4b93-be2d-393b00193430', 'bc11ae06-880a-48fb-a376-816032722407', 'c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846', 'ca329800-7bd0-4a38-8f24-ac862353c2b9', 'df249951-8827-44f4-9acf-7a661f727fd9', 'e96e25a4-9c0b-4f49-a2f8-622d9deec183', 'f10d385c-0e2e-4509-8bbe-069c1c687c54']",Hierarchical High-Order Functional Connectivity Networks and Selective Feature Fusion for MCI Classification,Neuroinformatics,2017

For representative points on the efficient frontier, the minimax regret portfolio is calculated, on the basis of the aforementioned scenarios. These points correspond to specific weight combinations. In this way, the areas of the efficient frontier that are more robust than others are identified. The underlying key-contribution is related to the extension of the conventional minimax regret criterion formulation, in multiobjective programming problems.

1637,"Pore-network models of porous media are useful in the study of pore-scale flow in porous media. In order to extract macroscopic properties from flow simulations in pore-networks, it is crucial the networks are large enough to be considered representative elementary volumes. However, existing two-phase network flow solvers are limited to relatively small domains. For this purpose, a multi-scale pore-network (MSPN) method, which takes into account flow-rate effects and can simulate larger domains compared to existing methods, was developed. In our solution algorithm, a large pore network is partitioned into several smaller sub-networks. The algorithm to advance the fluid interfaces within each subnetwork consists of three steps. First, a global pressure problem on the network is solved approximately using the multiscale finite volume (MSFV) method. Next, the fluxes across the subnetworks are computed. Lastly, using fluxes as boundary conditions, a dynamic two-phase flow solver is used to advance the solution in time. Simulation results of drainage scenarios at different capillary numbers and unfavourable viscosity ratios are presented and used to validate the MSPN method against solutions obtained by an existing dynamic network flow solver.","['Karim Khayrat', 'Patrick Jenny']",a466f320-0d38-4575-b2ad-0f015783ddc0,0,"['459a74f2-fa9d-4d64-b82e-b30e364b82c8', '81527260-8f35-4312-ab12-f6b21f683f37', '8b1d44a2-de6e-4775-88b6-5f0f69a70bd3', 'b84c1e28-ebf9-44cb-8c00-91a62323001c', 'cd727749-04f6-4f16-9c97-2a58420f6465']",A multi-scale network method for two-phase flow in porous media,Journal of Computational Physics,2017

This may cause leakage and eventual structural failure.

Herein data obtained for maximum pit depths for large-sized (1–2 m long) samples of 10 pipes exhumed from different, apparently randomly selected, locations after 34–129 years of service are examined for consistency with the Gumbel probability distribution. This was the case for the deepest pits, but the data for less deep pits show a consistent pattern of departure from the Gumbel distribution.

1639,"Politicians' clear separation between their professional and private lives has been challenged by a growing need to be seen as personable, especially on social media where this is the norm. Little, however, is known about the effect on a political party when its politicians reveal aspects of their private lives on social media. The present study addresses this question. Through the lens of self-presentation theory, we are the first to test the effect of a balanced presentation strategy on Twitter (i.e., tweets that involve both professional and private aspects of their lives) as opposed to a strictly professional one. A longitudinal design was adopted with 265 Twitter users as participants. The results showed that a balanced strategy increased both interest in the politician's party and intention to vote for that party, irrespective of a user's political interest, social media usage intensity, or age, or the gender of either the user or the communicating politician. Furthermore, liking the tweets emerged as a crucial mediator. This study contributes valuable knowledge on self-presentation strategies of politicians specifically, and more broadly regarding self-presentation in the face of context collapse. However we call for future research to validate our experimental findings in a real-life setting.

1640,"Underwater exploration has become an active research area over the past few decades. The image enhancement is one of the challenges for those computer vision based underwater researches because of the degradation of the images in the underwater environment. The scattering and absorption are the main causes in the underwater environment to make the images decrease their visibility, for example, blurry, low contrast, and reducing visual ranges. To tackle aforementioned problems, this paper presents a novel method for underwater image enhancement inspired by the Retinex framework, which simulates the human visual system. The term Retinex is created by the combinations of “Retina” and “Cortex”. The proposed method, namely LAB-MSR, is achieved by modifying the original Retinex algorithm. It utilizes the combination of the bilateral filter and trilateral filter on the three channels of the image in CIELAB color space according to the characteristics of each channel. With real world data, experiments are carried out to demonstrate both the degradation characteristics of the underwater images in different turbidities, and the competitive performance of the proposed method.","['Shu Zhang', 'Ting Wang', 'Junyu Dong', 'Hui Yu']",e54fecee-915b-4ab5-bd6e-b73b5feb874a,0,"['0c32535a-72bb-4fda-b12b-627147f8b358', '5440c118-167d-4855-8f19-a6e89c44c58a', '57cc976f-ea69-4fec-927d-5d749b7c743b', '698ee551-354f-4ecd-8f82-5752710d5731', '74c86bf5-ef87-44eb-bf4f-8589e6257b6e', '7c1cd3b5-5950-41f7-9165-e8a59bd228e2', '8d8b8fc0-dd59-411f-8b11-95804da5cc24', '953de4e8-0312-4b3c-8f26-98791149595b', '987ac6d2-8f3a-4d6e-886c-d5bad5bb2167', 'a59dc2fd-f7e8-40c0-ac3e-773e6a010850', 'a7db5fb4-0c72-4433-858c-12af23832cbf', 'acfaeaf4-7f51-46ab-82f0-183464ae2cbe', 'b2380ef6-bbb9-49c0-a0d5-e84039731830', 'b7fdfb26-0f3b-49c4-9d49-538c58d8620a', 'c9daa5b3-fc4c-4116-a7cf-855ec448a3b1', 'cde67b18-9a20-46fb-9233-936c2febfb05', 'f2cacce6-60a6-47ee-8622-6771e47f3651', 'fc2c6703-4782-4eee-b1ad-da931ca5b5a5']",Underwater image enhancement via extended multi-scale Retinex,Neurocomputing,2017
1641,"The modification (relaxation or intensification) of the antecedent or the consequent in a fuzzy “If, Then” conditional is an important asset for an expert in order to agree with it. The usual method to modify fuzzy propositions is the use of Zadeh's quantifiers based on powers of t-norms. However, the invariance of the truth value of the fuzzy conditional would be a desirable property when both the antecedent and the consequent are modified using the same quantifier. In this paper, a novel family of fuzzy implication functions based on powers of continuous t-norms which ensure the aforementioned property is presented. Other important additional properties are analyzed and from this study, it is proved that they do not intersect the most well-known classes of fuzzy implication functions.","['Sebastia Massanet', 'Jordi Recasens', 'Joan Torrens']",2220a047-fa79-4fc0-8592-6fb2bbb02c3e,0,"['03625eb7-b653-43b9-8b74-22f0a7054b49', '26aacaad-0325-4cb8-a682-a3f06e04d618', '272f6383-76f3-49f4-accc-f8c252bbc4d4', '33ffbe19-8f8f-4fb7-a44d-6d1d8d976ef6', '37634b0f-9bd8-4751-ac58-1075f8c9dea8', '3e21c207-1a6c-442b-b8e1-960451862ef8', '59f3dd35-d845-4e90-a7c0-1b7f50f7a64d', '6506964f-70d7-496d-b18d-d65d0052df21', '6c9aac4e-465d-449d-81da-a4ad1470dd42', '773da7ca-8c3a-468a-8684-957d241c1402', 'c715d08f-3812-4d9e-8383-1b0da5821940', 'ea6568fb-6788-4d7a-bbfc-ced33d707fae', 'f9a60729-ce07-4e70-af7e-b8517ffe4738']",Fuzzy implication functions based on powers of continuous t-norms,International Journal of Approximate Reasoning,2017
1642,"Shock models are of great interest in engineering reliability. Among the others, the δ-shock model has been widely studied in the literature. In this model, the system breaks down due to the arrivals of two successive shocks which are too close to each other. That is, the system fails when the time between two consecutive shocks falls below a fixed threshold δ. In the literature, the δ-shock model has been mostly studied by assuming that shocks arrive according to a renewal process so that the interarrival times between shocks are independent and identically distributed. In the current paper, we consider the case when the shock arrival process is described by a Polya process which has dependent interarrival times. In particular, we obtain survival function and mean lifetime of the system and study the optimal replacement policy for the δ-shock model based on Polya process.",['Serkan Eryilmaz'],d9a832f4-9d1a-46ba-b1b7-8cc29c5abe57,0,"['21d6a29c-298c-4123-88e9-aa49a3c07a2c', '2ccb9828-8a10-49fd-842b-d3220d2c86d1', '3a331a93-f024-4d42-ba28-6bc3bdf39935', '3d6af83d-14b6-46b3-88c9-a85b6a63ef85', '4a421e9e-9731-4323-898f-718f65b22700', '69ef11a7-686b-4ff8-80ba-7a53b35191ac', '72167f56-f83c-4f25-9266-c2f16de8d14e', '7b43851e-c3c2-470a-b8f2-4027e61f50ba', '82b7c4a3-9c8f-406f-a51b-98854c2f10d3', '947185a8-f05c-48a4-9436-95ba91807f7a', 'c0982efe-b8cd-4faf-af34-e81e64ec2b20']",δ-shock model based on Polya process and its optimal replacement policy,European Journal of Operational Research,2017
1643,"Carbohydrate-active enzymes are found in all organisms and participate in key biological processes. These enzymes are classified in 274 families in the CAZy database but the sequence diversity within each family makes it a major task to identify new family members and to provide basis for prediction of enzyme function. A fast and reliable method for de novo annotation of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes is to identify conserved peptides in the curated enzyme families followed by matching of the conserved peptides to the sequence of interest as demonstrated for the glycosyl hydrolase and the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase families. This approach not only assigns the enzymes to families but also provides functional prediction of the enzymes with high accuracy. We identified conserved peptides for all enzyme families in the CAZy database with Peptide Pattern Recognition. The conserved peptides were matched to protein sequence for de novo annotation and functional prediction of carbohydrate-active enzymes with the Hotpep method. Annotation of protein sequences from 12 bacterial and 16 fungal genomes to families with Hotpep had an accuracy of 0.84 (measured as F1-score) compared to semiautomatic annotation by the CAZy database whereas the dbCAN HMM-based method had an accuracy of 0.77 with optimized parameters. Furthermore, Hotpep provided a functional prediction with 86% accuracy for the annotated genes. Hotpep is available as a stand-alone application for MS Windows. Hotpep is a state-of-the-art method for automatic annotation and functional prediction of carbohydrate-active enzymes.","['Peter Kamp Busk', 'Bo Pilgaard', 'M. J. Lezyk', 'Anne S.

1644,"Signal recovery problem in compressed sensing can be mathematically modeled as a l0 regularized problem, which aims at searching a sparse solution. When tackling this problem, traditional mathematical approaches suffer from a limited convergence ability, especially under the noisy condition. To better solve this problem, in this paper, a novel differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm is designed to combine with a local search approach. First, an adaptive control strategy for DE is extended to recover sparse signals with noise in this paper, which is found to have a promising recovery performance. Second, in order to further enhance the convergence speed, a local search approach, i.e., a shrinkage-thresholding method (STM), is embedded into the evolutionary process of DE. Therefore, the advantages of local search capability provided by STM and global search ability of DE can be effectively combined, and resultantly a novel local search enhanced adaptive DE (named LSE-ADE) algorithm is proposed. Experimental results validate that LSE-ADE performs better than the eight classic sparse recovery algorithms and one recently proposed evolutionary algorithm, when recovering sparse signal under the noisy condition.","['Qiuzhen Lin', 'Bishan Hu', 'Ya Tang', 'Leo Yu Zhang', 'Jianyong Chen', 'Xiaomin Wang', 'Zhong Ming']",488a915f-28bb-4b11-89fd-6b31e6d1aca1,0,"['010a7f91-4d08-44b4-b0ba-4146c43cf227', '014cfe85-5aef-4543-abba-772b0ff3c87f', '0631b904-6f19-4ec1-8467-3f6271dc10c0', '0ef298dc-900f-488b-b0c1-1d25c2c0870f', '109367fa-db04-4db0-8777-d6ca7e9e78fd', '12ccd611-fbd3-4e78-a737-871f2acc4e93', '19a42cd3-c8ae-4f71-8c8c-4eae6ca48345', '1ac383de-ddbb-4b66-ade9-0bf0c8021c38', '1b357a63-5beb-4468-83af-fc2b5b4660db', '1d3cc20b-dc3e-4351-b313-7085c5e1e0b2', '23c53909-7857-47cb-9491-f53b0e893155', '260cac4a-d64e-4b2d-ac3d-129fe6b3c685', '2cb23ef0-cef9-4f6e-ba58-de98e33ef98d', '37d5f2c3-3db9-47b9-8486-e21f68ba0279', '3e2634f2-13a2-4b36-9b7a-f83d365e8580', '449bfdfc-f916-422c-ac0d-ebfdd2ab773a', '46d8c364-2ce7-4808-ab58-f8b6485bfd74', '569b3041-995d-47f4-b0e4-23f8341ed803', '5dc67e2c-a1f8-4eef-87fc-1cc8db93eb09', '65d5ccdc-7022-45b0-adf9-0385273b1283', '69b9ef96-11d5-49b0-9ae3-492763e02ca8', '6bf639ae-a52f-408e-897c-5d8e1211a4ba', '6ff01654-66d1-49c7-b526-1c8ed7fa893a', '71a18de9-e543-4337-ab7a-3db31d9f8c00', '7d1372a0-7b3c-47c8-9e05-0661b964304e', '8b55f725-e0e4-4674-8f8e-098634628b58', '958d7cab-9efd-493c-8a0d-d6c0666e4fcf', '97557543-a00f-4213-b04a-c12b63850a7e', 'a12fed1d-d5b7-406e-848d-e6dcca1e02dd', 'a83e12fd-0eed-4619-943c-65a3f9f3a23a', 'a9f7f9e6-8354-4048-941f-499825dbab1a', 'adc31a96-1f8e-4793-8ee9-ecef04a16ac6', 'af6d91d3-3a39-400c-8130-ca744d2b1fe3', 'bb3c38fa-c2b0-4d4f-8c9d-ca1884343474', 'bd3056e1-05c3-431f-8d26-c111ed700fc6', 'c07672ea-f8db-41d3-a1e6-9de2f864398c', 'cdc8301b-e4a8-43ba-a5bc-b003ebe4edf6', 'dba51c0d-9e96-49a4-a2bf-722fd03f6fa1', 'e4b468aa-2b23-4229-8872-f9286464a19f', 'e5b8523a-bc81-4389-8569-741e2c590dd3', 'f0e7f31f-6185-4c93-91d6-7bfe3cfc49cb', 'f56b877b-4060-4754-b303-e8140968544c', 'f68f3200-b814-4fe1-9093-10ac7507f816', 'fd7205d5-656f-4fda-a9dc-3851a2c1da6f']",A local search enhanced differential evolutionary algorithm for sparse recovery,Applied Soft Computing,2017

The framework has evolved through an extensive program of research on human decision-making and clinical practice.

1649,"Caches are widely used in embedded systems to bridge the increasing speed gap between processors and off-chip memory. However, caches make it significantly harder to compute the worst-case execution time (WCET) of a task. To alleviate this problem, cache locking has been proposed. We investigate the WCET-aware I-cache locking problem and propose a novel dynamic I-cache locking heuristic approach for reducing the WCET of a task. For a nonnested loop, our approach aims at selecting a minimum set of memory blocks of the loop as locked cache contents by using the min-cut algorithm. For a loop nest, our approach not only aims at selecting a minimum set of memory blocks of the loop nest as locked cache contents but also finds a good loading point for each selected memory block. We propose two algorithms for finding a good loading point for each selected memory block, a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm and an integer linear programming (ILP)-based algorithm, further reducing the WCET of each loop nest. We have implemented our approach and compared it to two state-of-the-art I-cache locking approaches by using a set of benchmarks from the MRTC benchmark suite. The experimental results show that the polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for finding a good loading point for each selected memory block performs almost equally as well as the ILP-based algorithm. Compared to the partial locking approach proposed in Ding et al. [2012], our approach using the heuristic algorithm achieves the average improvements of 33%, 15%, 9%, 3%, 8%, and 11% for the 256B, 512B, 1KB, 4KB, 8KB, and 16KB caches, respectively. Compared to the dynamic locking approach proposed in Puaut [2006], it achieves the average improvements of 9%, 19%, 18%, 5%, 11%, and 16% for the 256B, 512B, 1KB, 4KB, 8KB, and 16KB caches, respectively.","['Wenguang Zheng', 'Hui Wu', 'Qing Yang']",5a4e3a08-3668-4106-aef6-217a158a980a,0,"['34a9248a-96ea-427d-835d-85f4c7c9b486', '3b3b3235-9963-45b4-af35-1a9096458206', '56b968d1-cf4d-42dc-983a-51807cf34c36', '597065e3-6b85-4729-8118-7b8bc3dd203c', '6d08da28-b267-43cb-a9b8-69c3f84d1290', '6db465d2-267b-478d-80e6-860eb6057087', '7d7b5bd4-35a9-4148-84fc-eaf0cede6f85', '84f38277-cf2e-4362-b807-4208af039806', '86c4ed2a-03f0-459d-a1f3-e54d1bbce176', '97fd8752-48ba-4d83-9d6c-9cf65278f216', '99cadb95-29de-4e4d-991e-264525d15215', 'a2b540cc-c4b3-4556-beed-f55b359fcdd0', 'b06ec4aa-4368-465f-8bb1-9a78496c68ff', 'b6208d93-998c-4593-b2d9-1d3ff936750f', 'c19a9ec4-822b-4b02-adc0-0af8d84632e9', 'c4066795-14a2-4d6f-ae8b-8723b892dca5', 'ce0e359f-afb0-4e15-ada9-e2f97edb5940', 'ce92d487-d46a-449d-8fc1-9e03bcfa9561', 'd7e9fb89-4463-4cc6-96cc-c0890ef74bb3', 'dbae7bb7-6db4-45e2-b942-a07b03c538ad', 'e2b6b97a-234e-4b3e-879b-1425c0c02894', 'edfdc385-140c-4b21-8ce3-bbd7b1a0d370', 'eeb7bdc6-cef0-4c31-aff7-3cec62846437']",WCET-Aware Dynamic I-Cache Locking for a Single Task,ACM Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization,2017
1650,"Requirements engineering practice in industry is often encumbered by practical limits of time, resource, and attention. In our environment, most requirements authors have had no formal training in the practice, yet are expected to produce high-quality specifications that drive subsequent work. Authors are often unaware of different techniques for requirements specification and are rarely equipped to navigate all of the techniques and tools that are potentially available to them, to the extent that they are even aware of the various options. A small cadre of coaches, providing focused, just-in-time mentoring of authors in a handful of basic techniques can increase the proficiency of these authors, who in turn produce higher-quality requirements specifications. From this foundation, authors may be able to later adopt additional techniques to further improve the quality and maturity of their work, thus resulting in improved work products built on the basis of those specifications.","['Sarah Gregory', 'John Terzakis']",41199f5e-c0ec-4cd0-9463-08f242d2d8d9,0,"['adf50e86-0e86-4e14-8f55-e6b079562b77', 'bdf1c071-0c48-4ea2-8725-f45b5ccd4136']",Viewpoint: effectiveness of focused mentoring to improve requirements engineering industrial practice,Requirements Engineering,2017
1651,"Online pairwise learning algorithms with general convex loss functions without regularization in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) are investigated. Under mild conditions on loss functions and the RKHS, upper bounds for the expected excess generalization error are derived in terms of the approximation error when the stepsize sequence decays polynomially. In particular, for Lipschitz loss functions such as the hinge loss, the logistic loss and the absolute-value loss, the bounds can be of order             O  (   T   −   1  3     log  T  )         after  T    iterations, while for the least squares loss, the bounds can be of order             O  (   T   −   1  4     log  T  )  .

1652,"In this paper, we propose a method for solving constrained optimization problems using Interval Analysis combined with Particle Swarm Optimization. A Set Inverter Via Interval Analysis algorithm is used to handle constraints in order to reduce constrained optimization to quasi unconstrained one. The algorithm is useful in the detection of empty search spaces, preventing useless executions of the optimization process. To improve computational efficiency, a Space Cleaning algorithm is used to remove solutions that are certainly not optimal. As a result, the search space becomes smaller at each step of the optimization procedure. After completing pre-processing, a modified Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is applied to the reduced search space to find the global optimum. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated through comprehensive experimentation involving 100,000 runs on a set of well-known benchmark constrained engineering design problems. The computational efficiency of the new method is quantified by comparing its results with other PSO variants found in the literature.","['T.M. Machado-Coelho', 'A.M.C. Machado', 'L.

1654,"Pose estimation and tracking of an articulated structure based on data from multiple cameras has seen numerous applications in recent years. In this paper, a marker-based human pose tracking algorithm from multi view video sequences is proposed. The purpose of the proposed algorithm is to present a low cost motion capture system that can be used as an alternative to high cost available commercial human motion capture systems. The problem is defined as the optimization of 45 parameters which define body pose model and is solved using a modified version of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The objective of this optimization is to maximize a fitness function which formulates how much the body model matches with 2D marker coordinates in video frames. A sampling covariance matrix is used in the first part of the velocity equation of PSO and is annealed with iterations. The sampling covariance matrix is computed adaptively, based on variance of parameters in the swarm. One of the concerns in this algorithm is the high number of parameters to define the model of body pose. To tackle this problem, we partition the optimization state space into six stages that exploit the hierarchical structure of the skeletal model. The first stage optimizes the six parameters that define the global orientation and position of the body. Other stages relate to optimization of right and left hand, right and left leg and head orientation. In the proposed partitioning method previously optimized parameters are allowed some variation in each step that is called soft partitioning. Experimental results on Pose Estimation and Action Recognition (PEAR) database indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves lower estimation error in tracking human motion compared with Annealed Particle Filter (APF) and Parametric Annealing (PA) methods.","['Ashraf Sharifi', 'Ahad Harati', 'Abedin Vahedian']",eb8a56a1-9440-4e03-b152-91554fcdb227,0,"['00a2b94f-4ead-4293-8e53-d1d1da5fc295', '0a91533e-4954-49d2-8b67-089724acfceb', '0c7f1761-ade6-40bf-8870-6c62770bd8ab', '127d3cd1-d740-4cc3-ac83-e11bae676515', '17bdb8f8-33b5-40df-8895-559ae00fde74', '20663df0-a824-4dd1-ada7-718731a33435', '4f4b4cde-624a-408d-8abc-868d52428fc7', '52bbdf97-9085-4469-a12d-6539258ebd24', '5bd9e3d2-6884-4b60-a316-19281549ef06', '5dd92dca-af44-4be3-a0dd-714747d763fb', '643c4e30-5f16-4a89-b845-8c1b39514045', '6ad1e0f6-2654-4db5-984b-4ec7ef5b6abe', '7bcbcfd2-1e5d-402e-9109-86ba148cb6be', '85b3f2cf-a588-44a1-88e8-1b1440c84150', '8f7ca3f9-d167-4d2f-8522-0fa255b1ef4f', '93c428d5-41f1-4342-8f41-14c28632dee7', '9e782ace-7971-4a8b-bed8-6d01fbbb88e1', 'a1fb7d7f-fb69-468e-8a17-d3c27a36616c', 'c7dff183-b701-4aec-8e83-1c3539b811cd', 'e79a54a6-8362-45f3-963b-ad54e0e3b287', 'f422cd00-60cf-4103-bff2-99f03b606368', 'f5627848-0c4a-4274-b6af-267cf4c6ba6e']",Marker-based human pose tracking using adaptive annealed particle swarm optimization with search space partitioning ☆,Image and Vision Computing,2017
1655,"In recent years, sparse and low-rank models have been widely used to formulate appearance subspace for visual tracking. However, most existing methods only consider the sparsity or low-rankness of the coefficients, which is not sufficient enough for appearance subspace learning on complex video sequences. Moreover, as both the low-rank and the column sparse measures are tightly related to all the samples in the sequences, it is challenging to incrementally solve optimization problems with both nuclear norm and column sparse norm on sequentially obtained video data. To address above limitations, this paper develops a novel low-rank subspace learning with adaptive penalization (LSAP) framework for subspace based robust visual tracking. Different from previous work, which often simply decomposes observations as low-rank features and sparse errors, LSAP simultaneously learns the subspace basis, low-rank coefficients and column sparse errors to formulate appearance subspace. Within LSAP framework, we introduce a Hadamard production based regularization to incorporate rich generative/discriminative structure constraints to adaptively penalize the coefficients for subspace learning. It is shown that such adaptive penalization can significantly improve the robustness of LSAP on severely corrupted dataset. To utilize LSAP for online visual tracking, we also develop an efficient incremental optimization scheme for nuclear norm and column sparse norm minimizations. Experiments on 50 challenging video sequences demonstrate that our tracker outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.","['Risheng Liu', 'Di Wang', 'Yuzhuo Han', 'Xin Fan', 'Zhongxuan Luo']",f0985b34-39fe-4ff0-8107-0a640c84af03,0,"['01b486c4-8955-403b-a0c6-1de74298b215', '108deb1a-f09c-4d65-ae13-ce545c09dbb9', '20c05eda-c553-4d16-b71d-792fed694c47', '225f0a5d-ee99-459e-92a2-c8c0dd745c75', '30da7972-c0bd-4f18-ae2a-b5684ba6d9c9', '3285b3a3-22ae-4976-8a55-c1e6152d8ed2', '365624b0-a043-4d7d-ae9b-64ff5b8cd652', '3bf042bd-3d9e-49cf-b1be-af6d4b383bdd', '3d650753-6eac-4b35-8af1-c521c55bab56', '415570d4-085c-48ac-a46d-45ff905b4238', '41b6973d-9b8e-43b4-b49b-82222fad96f2', '4763f653-5be4-4d80-947d-1394c5b63f85', '4a379b0d-bc36-4b62-bdb1-40e4592e326a', '4b1cd041-8111-42b8-8348-70efec7044f6', '4b9c17d1-9a08-48a2-95e0-47d3d4452a96', '4cafba1b-d046-4fc5-a427-c4a54410d1a1', '5f838641-f367-4b45-b577-8a533a0e5405', '7236dbb7-f0b2-4e28-bb7c-6de187c32d64', '745b1cd9-abc7-4b3a-afed-7fa9c375f27b', '7689b706-c426-4ae7-a14f-cf73bae72603', '78cfeb75-55f9-40b5-8389-60526cf76613', '83c737b8-e084-4766-ba6e-131e6a1c017c', '910a223b-1f53-4100-a600-6cce47c85f1d', '92f24f9d-b487-452b-9d0f-ec626d42096a', 'a088197c-93df-488a-958b-8410929a17a0', 'a81d35e6-d5cd-4eef-9144-b0755ef268d1', 'b1bdf5c1-717b-40eb-85fb-9d96f5611f11', 'bbe9d7f7-6a0f-4a40-a5db-cfe90b5124ee', 'bc9d9aee-be96-44a1-b36e-4c4421f06d9d', 'c527458f-946e-4566-96a3-418e59088801', 'c5e509f1-51c9-4964-9242-491283fca091', 'c8cc88b8-d971-49e9-8810-e784c856872f', 'c915f5fc-0d59-49ac-9427-f214a3521baa', 'd194f1f2-9926-44be-8fe9-9d06583aca91', 'd35531f1-ddde-4b9f-ad5c-9af2613433a9', 'd51d365d-6670-4bf6-89da-7d03788b9c5f', 'dee52dac-0991-40b3-89b5-d4269b993980', 'e0af11a9-b7e7-4d50-927d-14cc136f484b', 'e30006aa-a666-4d31-a6e5-9464797811a6', 'e7c04cdc-ed81-4744-8a11-526d9ea66ac1', 'ee9a02c2-f9a5-4b0a-8980-1625cb464f22', 'f51869d5-2777-4539-863b-6828684cf5b5', 'fb366046-0620-4e4e-a7ac-409d8296a0ac']",Adaptive low-rank subspace learning with online optimization for robust visual tracking,Neural Networks,2017

Methods  All residents were asked to fill an augmented version of the POE satisfaction and usage survey for both POE systems. The results were compared to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each system.  Results  Fifty-one respondents had used the CPOE system and the PBOE system. Overall, satisfaction was higher with PBOE than CPOE (odds ratio (OR)=3.74; p  Conclusion  Residents did not report any increase in safety issues with the rapid switch from CPOE to PBOE.

1657,"This study aims to empirically test the impact of the Motivation-Ability-Opportunity- (MAO) model on knowledge work. We propose that knowledge work is a function of employees' motivation, ability and opportunity. In this regard, the aim is to provide empirical support to explain the effects of motivation, ability and opportunity on knowledge-work, which we defined as a knowledge-centered behavior. Data was collected through a self-report questionnaire. A sample size of 350 employees of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad answered the questionnaire.

1658,"Multimedia big data is difficult to handle because of its enormous amount and the elusive property of underlying information. To study how to explore valuable information among multimedia big data with low complexity, this paper proposes an object detection method of big data, which is in compressive measurement domain under a mobile distributed computing architecture. It includes the sparse representation and object detection processes. Considering the unbalanced computation capacity between a mobile center cloud and mobile edge sites, we shift large storage burden into the cloud, while performing the dictionary learning by using compressive measurements in the mobile edge sites. Specifically, after getting the measurements at the edge sites, we perform dictionary learning to obtain the sparse representation in pixel domain, then select significant images and their feature vectors to be stored in the center cloud. In addition, we also analyze the trained dictionary in the measurement domain employing measurements. In order to reveal the two kinds of dictionaries’ relationship, we conduct a formulation process into each of them and find that the relationship depends on the uniqueness relation between the original signal and the sparse coefficient in the measurement domain. At the same time, we keep coefficients for a certain time period at the mobile edge sites in order to realize real time object detection, taking the advantage of low latency of the mobile edge computing ends. Since the sparse coefficients and the original signal have a one-to-one correspondence relationship, we can just search for the matched coefficients of the image block for detecting object. Experimental results show that Hadamard measurement matrix can better preserve the characteristics of the original signal than Gaussian matrix and that the proposed method can achieve a favorable detection performance. Meanwhile, the computation cost and storage cost of the proposed detection process can be significantly reduced compared with traditional methods, which is suitable for the multimedia big data. This can also be used in smart cities for looking for lost children and other specific events.","['Jie Guo', 'Bin Song', 'Fei Richard Yu', 'Zheng Yan', 'Laurence T.

However, models that explicitly incorporate spatial and temporal dependencies face challenges in data availability, methodology and computation. In this research, parcel-level dynamics are investigated using the geocoded Auditor's tax database for Delaware County, Ohio, including 73,560 parcels over the period 1990–2012. A binary spatio-temporal autologistic model (STARM), incorporating space and time and their interactions, is used to investigate parcel-level dynamics. The results show that the model is able capture the impacts of contemporaneous and historical neighborhood conditions around parcels, as well as the effects of other variables such as distances to various facilities and infrastructures, agricultural and residential land-use shares within a half mile radius circle, and population density and growth expectation at the census tract level.","['Emre Tepe', 'Jean-Michel Guldmann']",d1d2ce39-b789-4cea-acd9-de71af7b87f0,0,['546f15a3-580a-48de-bba5-ddd4811e003a'],Spatial and temporal modeling of parcel-level land dynamics,"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",2017
1660,"An industrial scheme, to simulate the compressible two-phase flow in porous media, consists of a finite volume method together with a phase-by-phase upstream scheme. The implicit finite volume scheme satisfies industrial constraints of robustness since the proposed scheme discretizes the equations with gravity and capillary terms. We show that the proposed scheme satisfies the maximum principle for the saturation, a discrete-energy estimate on the pressures, and a function of the saturation that denotes capillary terms. These stability results allow us to derive the convergence of a subsequence to a weak solution of the continuous equations as the size of the discretization tends to zero. To our knowledge, this is the first convergence result of a finite volume scheme in the case of two-phase compressible flow in several space dimensions. The proof is given for the complete system when the density of each phase depends on its own pressure.","['Bilal Saad', 'Mazen Saad']",2ba77cc5-3e26-4ce7-855a-7e1c0536748f,3,[],Study of full implicit petroleum engineering finite volume scheme for compressible two phase flow in porous media,SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis,2013
1661,"In this paper, a dual-transformer-based asymmetrical triple-port active bridge converter (DT-ATAB) is proposed to interface two different dc-sources and a load. DT-ATAB consists of three active power electronic converters and two high-frequency transformers. All switches of these converters can be turned  on  with zero-voltage switching to reduce the switching losses. The bidirectional power flow operation is possible between the ports. The DT-ATAB also reduces the circulating powers between the ports for well-matched transformer turns ratios as compared to those in the other existing triple-port active bridge converters (TAB). Furthermore, the magnetic short-circuit conditions arising in the three-winding transformer of the TAB are mitigated in DT-ATAB. The principle of operation, steady-state analysis, various modes of operation (three-port and two-port modes), and a closed loop controller of DT-ATAB are presented. The theoretical analysis of this paper is verified using both simulation and experimental studies. The illustrated results show that DT-ATAB can be used as a promising multiport converter to interface the multiple sources and load to achieve wide-ranging outputs with the minimal losses.","['Venkat Nag Someswar Rao Jakka', 'Anshuman Shukla', 'Georgios Demetriades']",59226cfc-4974-475a-bd31-f3b541a764b0,0,"['0c3f6c05-292a-4d44-82bc-6a57609bf704', '51859f9a-8573-424a-9973-c44753609eb3', '60d07d98-ecb8-4db8-8bf1-2116e1ec46a4', 'dd191066-0bb4-444f-a482-386dc8945f87', 'edf27cec-78c6-4d43-bd6f-ecbaff093bb5', 'f19f881b-1968-4ad0-951b-7274b386e9d3']",Dual-Transformer-Based Asymmetrical Triple-Port Active Bridge (DT-ATAB) Isolated DC–DC Converter,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,2017

Our aim was to identify the most conserved and immunogenic antigens that can be considered as potential vaccine candidates. KEGG database was used to find out pathways unique to the bacteria. Subcellular localization of the protein sequences taken from the selected 36 pathways were predicted using PSORTb v3.0.2 and CELLO v2.5. Prediction of B cell epitope and the probability of the antigenicity were evaluated by using IEDB and Vaxijen respectively. BLASTp was done to find out the similarity of the selected proteins with the human proteome. Proteins failing to comply with the set parameters were filtered at each step.

1664,"Abstract  The aim of this work is to compare Bayesian Inference for nonlinear models with commonly used traditional non-linear regression (NR) algorithms for estimating tracer kinetics in Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI). The algorithms are compared in terms of accuracy, and reproducibility under different initialization settings. Further it is investigated how a more robust estimation of tracer kinetics affects cancer diagnosis. The derived tracer kinetics from the Bayesian algorithm were validated against traditional NR algorithms (i.e. Levenberg-Marquardt, simplex) in terms of accuracy on a digital DCE phantom and in terms of goodness-of-fit (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) on ROI-based concentration time courses from two different patient cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 76 men, 20 of whom had significant peripheral zone prostate cancer (any cancer-core-length (CCL) with Gleason>3+3 or any-grade with CCL>=4mm) following transperineal template prostate mapping biopsy. The second cohort consisted of 9 healthy volunteers and 24 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The diagnostic ability of the derived tracer kinetics was assessed with receiver operating characteristic area under curve (ROC AUC) analysis. The Bayesian algorithm accurately recovered the ground-truth tracer kinetics for the digital DCE phantom consistently improving the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) across the 50 different initializations compared to NR. For optimized initialization, Bayesian did not improve significantly the fitting accuracy on both patient cohorts, and it only significantly improved the v e  ROC AUC on the HN population from ROC AUC=0.56 for the simplex to ROC AUC=0.76. For both cohorts, the values and the diagnostic ability of tracer kinetic parameters estimated with the Bayesian algorithm weren't affected by their initialization. To conclude, the Bayesian algorithm led to a more accurate and reproducible quantification of tracer kinetic parameters in DCE-MRI, improving their ROC-AUC and decreasing their dependence on initialization settings.","['Nikolaos Dikaios', 'David Atkinson', 'Chiara Tudisca', 'Pierpaolo Purpura', 'Martin Forster', 'Hashim U.

1665,"Visual formats have advanced beyond single-view images and videos: 3D movies are commonplace, researchers have developed multi-view navigation systems, and VR is helping to push light field cameras to mass market. However, editing tools for these media are still nascent, and even simple filtering operations like color correction or stylization are problematic: naively applying image filters per frame or per view rarely produces satisfying results due to time and space inconsistencies. Our method preserves and stabilizes filter effects while being agnostic to the inner working of the filter. It captures filter effects in the gradient domain, then uses \emph{input}, frame gradients as a reference to impose temporal and spatial consistency. Our least-squares formulation adds minimal overhead compared to naive data processing. Further, when filter cost is high, we introduce a filter transfer strategy that reduces the number of per-frame filtering computations by an order of magnitude, with only a small reduction in visual quality. We demonstrate our algorithm on several camera array formats including stereo videos, light fields, and wide baselines.","['Nicolas Bonneel', 'James Tompkin', 'D. L.

1667,"Condition-based maintenance (CBM) has received increasing attention in the literature over the past years. The application of CBM in practice, however, is lagging behind. This is, at least in part, explained by the complexity of real-life systems as opposed to the stylized ones studied most often. To overcome this issue, research is focusing more and more on complex systems, with multiple components subject to various dependencies. Existing classifications of these dependencies in the literature are no longer sufficient. Therefore, we provide an extended classification scheme. Besides the types of dependencies identified in the past (economic, structural, and stochastic), we add resource dependence, where multiple components are connected through, e.g., shared spares, tools, or maintenance workers. Furthermore, we extend the existing notion of structural dependence by distinguishing between structural dependence from a technical point of view and structural dependence from a performance point of view (e.g., through a series or parallel setting). We review the advances made with respect to CBM. Our main focus is on the implications of dependencies on the structure of the optimal CBM policy.

1668,"This article presents an extension of the IaaS Cloud simulator CloudSim. This extension takes into account the processing of i/o workload generated by virtual machines within a data center, and evaluates the overall performance and energy consumption. Indeed, according to state-of-the-art mstudies, storage systems energy consumption may account for as much as 40% in a data center. So, we modified the time computation model of CloudSim to consider i/o operations. Additionally, we designed several models of storage system devices including Hard Disk Drives and Solid-State Drives. We also modeled cpu utilization to compute the energy consumptions related to i/o request processing. This was achieved through machine learning techniques. Our storage system extensions have been evaluated using video encoding traces. The simulation results show that a significant amount of energy, around 25%, is consumed due to i/o workload execution. This corroborates the soundness of our CloudSim extensions.","['Hamza Ouarnoughi', 'Jalil Boukhobza', 'Frank Singhoff', 'Stéphane Rubini']",5652eae4-ec59-448d-bca7-224d2a97ab42,0,"['444373bf-e707-462c-9da2-48c67e9d4187', '5a4c1b07-75f7-4f13-a03c-7666f7ccea87', '72d89a52-fd23-4bf6-8949-db94d1e5a0b6', '895a17d7-c502-4fe6-82aa-9515d71d5689', '9921441a-63fe-4ba3-84ad-50cb791c1f9b', '9e86f71d-bba9-48e4-8516-a0d65442390a', 'a6d202bc-0b4b-4700-bed6-7760711c7e86', 'b072412c-a28e-42a4-8ed7-8f0abaf5915d', 'ca865388-c76a-4cae-b064-fb2e6d76233f', 'da353f81-aa28-4dd3-8b1f-f8898cb6d4e8', 'e7ab64aa-4835-4981-8647-565a9f32e96b', 'ebdfb6d4-8a49-4c33-ab68-22a20d398c25', 'f430555b-894f-4ed7-955f-612c09f0abc6', 'f625392c-4a66-47d2-a645-0fd4ff7f4b00']",Integrating I/Os in Cloudsim for Performance and Energy Estimation,Operating Systems Review,2017
1669,"In analyzing longitudinal data, within-subject correlations are a major factor that affects statistical efficiency. Working with a partially linear model for longitudinal data, a subject-wise empirical likelihood based method that takes the within-subject correlations into consideration is proposed to estimate the model parameters. A nonparametric version of the Wilks Theorem for the limiting distribution of the empirical likelihood ratio, which relies on a kernel regression smoothing method to properly centered data, is derived. The estimation of the nonparametric baseline function is also considered. A simulation study and an application are reported to investigate the finite sample properties of the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.","['Lianfen Qian', 'Suojin Wang']",66a00e3e-938b-4e17-9a04-c8f6526720d8,0,[],Subject-wise empirical likelihood inference in partial linear models for longitudinal data,Computational Statistics & Data Analysis,2017
1670,"Peer-to-peer network is organized on top of another network as an overlay network. Super peer network is one of the peer-to-peer networks. A super peer, in a super peer based network, is a peer that has more responsibility than other peers have and is responsible for some of the tasks of network management. Since different peers vary in terms of capabilities, selecting a super peer is a challenge in super peer based networks. Gradient topology is of the networks based on super peers. Existing adaptive algorithms, which have been proposed to select super peer in gradient topology, are not aware of delays among the peers. In this paper, the proposed algorithm being aware of the delay among super peers, using learning automata, which is a reinforcement model of learning, selects the new super peers in an adaptive manner. According to the simulation results, the proposed algorithm with respect to the average end-to-end delay in community of super peers, and error in the super peer selection, has better performance than existing algorithms.","['Sara Fathipour Deiman', 'Ali Mohammad Saghiri', 'Mohammad Reza Meybodi']",a2b1bca8-fa93-41c4-84d7-77f1cb4e3df3,0,"['092300d0-146d-46d6-ba94-7188584c4ccc', '1c26a829-77e9-4222-bedd-cc6133c1790e', '1d4f7fc5-16e0-4463-bef2-f35ce9642a06', '1e48865a-0599-4e87-b511-d90ef940a715', '1f7efe61-19b7-4529-b89f-789f9dc1a35e', '3160b8d1-097a-49f1-ad02-03a401da87a3', '365dbb2a-b39c-4df6-a9ee-80c5ae401790', '3ad3aba7-c73b-4c79-9a7e-68be58992bc7', '4563ed72-3d33-44b6-a315-aeeb9590b387', '46fea0f2-9cd9-4f2e-90bf-fa875828c6c5', '5691f4e8-8f10-4cf2-879c-d36c23b36ce4', '6f7b36e7-a0e5-45a7-9dc9-3795cc2c09a8', '749cefe5-bcab-4f6c-aa62-c3001664c53a', 'a427adc2-5ada-4d01-893a-248f321ed5a1', 'a6c3b01c-0b09-4935-b3f7-d2bb784dd442', 'a9e08f8a-cfc0-42cf-a4ae-c7f24e9d5938', 'b500b382-a6af-4aef-a18c-980bbb6ac62e', 'beaa9bd3-b13c-4005-b6ba-290d2d908841', 'cfa2cd65-e411-4f17-9bbe-6dab899db830', 'eca53f70-2d14-448d-bf4e-cc5b557b6d3e']",A Delay Aware Super-Peer Selection Algorithm for Gradient Topology Utilizing Learning Automata,Wireless Personal Communications,2017
1671,"A computational secret-sharing scheme is a method that enables a dealer, that has a secret, to distribute this secret among a set of parties such that a “qualified” subset of parties can efficiently reconstruct the secret while any “unqualified” subset of parties cannot efficiently learn anything about the secret. The collection of “qualified” subsets is defined by a monotone Boolean function. It has been a major open problem to understand which (monotone) functions can be realized by a computational secret-sharing scheme. Yao suggested a method for secret-sharing for any function that has a polynomial-size monotone circuit (a class which is strictly smaller than the class of monotone functions in \({\mathsf {P},},\)). Around 1990 Rudich raised the possibility of obtaining secret-sharing for all monotone functions in \({\mathsf {NP},},\): in order to reconstruct the secret a set of parties must be “qualified” and provide a witness attesting to this fact. Recently, Garg et al. (Symposium on theory of computing conference, STOC, pp 467–476, 2013) put forward the concept of witness encryption, where the goal is to encrypt a message relative to a statement \(x\in L\) for a language \(L\in {\mathsf {NP},},\) such that anyone holding a witness to the statement can decrypt the message; however, if \(x\notin L\), then it is computationally hard to decrypt. Garg et al. showed how to construct several cryptographic primitives from witness encryption and gave a candidate construction. One can show that computational secret-sharing implies witness encryption for the same language. Our main result is the converse: we give a construction of a computational secret-sharing scheme for any monotone function in \({\mathsf {NP},},\) assuming witness encryption for \({\mathsf {NP},},\) and one-way functions. As a consequence we get a completeness theorem for secret-sharing: computational secret-sharing scheme for any single monotone \({\mathsf {NP},},\)-complete function implies a computational secret-sharing scheme for every monotone function in \({\mathsf {NP},},\).","['Ilan Komargodski', 'Moni Naor', 'Eylon Yogev']",c3020a17-2c9f-4e58-80ea-2b81a2086c65,0,"['05c4021c-2169-45a0-949b-d3fab1b88af1', '0b625a6a-47b5-46c8-aec8-2573f2ae0575', '0ecfbd0d-879f-4a98-b03c-d8fab23e720d', '0f9acc86-7f53-4624-b9e4-4e294d5e7bf4', '283c532d-0924-4d30-a952-6aecd2eb7b9c', '451c2bde-398b-44e8-a537-38e0d4b9a4aa', '534cd698-b619-4753-866f-805755928229', '5e197249-0312-49a8-ad2a-30491df95412', '65876893-352c-4a60-9cd3-f83c2637f37e', '66e703f1-0a2f-4e98-809b-6b64f795ec7d', '8fbd8547-077b-4cec-b5d4-d26f31b324ce', '98f543e3-d61c-4099-ae96-237816472592', 'c0fd0a80-ce32-4a76-872b-5ce7c049da63', 'c2090348-1c2e-486f-92f2-65cc2aed3719', 'cc6f7603-64b7-4738-ab00-a82d51b1074d']",Secret-Sharing for NP,Journal of Cryptology,2017
